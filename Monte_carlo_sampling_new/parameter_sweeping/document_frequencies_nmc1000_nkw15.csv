7098,0.085,85.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
5542,0.02,20.0000,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dubé et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
6351,0.008,8.0000,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "
4726,0.008,8.0000,"The number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is gradually increasing in Japan, and the morbidity rate from tuberculosis in the Japanese people is high. Accordingly, the number of cases with both infections is considered to increase in the future. Our hospital has already encountered 31 cases of HIV associated tuberculosis. HIV infects mainly CD4-positive cells. The extreme decrease in the cell count results in serious cellular immunological disorder. CD4-positive cell disorder induces disorders of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophage functions. These destructive conditions show the state of immunodeficiency including macrophage that are most important for defense of acid-fast bacterial infection. Migration and activation of macrophages with cytokines derived from T cells are impaired to induce the following phenomena: hypoplasia of granuloma, failure of tubercule bacillus suppression, the spread to regional lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes), and hematogenous dissemination. On this occasion, caseous necrosis and cavitation are unlikely to occur, and false-negative tuberculin reaction is often observed. The incidence of severe cases, which include miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, etc., and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, are high among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated tuberculosis cases. HIV-infected tuberculosis cases are generally regarded as endogenous exacerbation, but they include primary infection and reinfection as well. Even during the treatment for drug-sensitive strains particularly, some cases may have reinfection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, suggesting that caution should be taken against this point. Conversely, the association of tuberculosis is a factor for the poor prognosis of HIV infection, since it facilitates the development of HIV infection. If the bacteria belong to a drug-sensitive strain, the infection with them responds well to antituberculous drugs, the same as in tuberculosis cases without HIV infection, showing a favorable prognosis. However, the mortality rate of infection with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely high. The combined use of a protease inhibitor, i.e., anti-HIV drug, with rifampicin is regarded as contraindication for the treatment because rifampicin strongly induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 and increases the metabolism of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptases to markedly decrease the blood concentrations. Accordingly, the treatment for tuberculosis should take priority over that for HIV infection in HIV-infected tuberculosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be administered after the treatment of tuberculosis. When HAART is necessary for the treatment during the tuberculosis treatment, rifampicin had better be exchanged to rifabutin because the effect of rifabutin to induce cytochrome P-450 is less potent than that of rifampicin. A report has recently shown that the exacerbation of pyrexia and chest X-ray findings was transiently observed approximately 2 weeks after potent anti-HIV therapy for HIV-infected tuberculosis, which included a protease inhibitor. The reason for the exacerbation has been believed to be that the impaired function of CD4-positive cells is improved by the administration of anti-HIV drugs to raise temporarily the reaction of the vital part to M. tuberculosis. A tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction size of > or = 5 mm of induration is considered positive (i.e., indicative of M. tuberculosis infection) in persons who are infected with HIV. Persons with a TST reaction size > or = 5 mm who have not previously received treatment for M. tuberculosis infection should receive tuberculosis preventive treatment. Prevention by BCG vaccination is regarded as contraindications for HIV-infected patients, because disseminated M. bovis infection may be associated with them. Many HIV-positive patients infected with tuberculosis show uneventful healing, when M. tuberculosis is the sensitive strain. However, since some patients show the rapid course of tuberculosis, clinical physicians keep the early detection of tuberculosis for HIV-infected patients and the association of HIV infection for tuberculosis patients in their mind, respectively."
9794,0.008,8.0000,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
2709,0.008,8.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
8572,0.007,7.0000,"HIV infection is the major public health, social and economic problem in Georgia. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."
7191,0.007,7.0000,"In our HIV outpatient centre where over 1,200 patients are followed, maraviroc as an entry inhibitor was introduced in 2010. We aimed to assess the background, the therapeutic challenges and the prospective monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including maraviroc. Sixty-six patients started a maraviroc-containing cART with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.9±10.7 years. This interim analysis presents patients who had at least 12 (mean 16.9±12.8) months of follow-up. One to 17 previous cART changes prompted the introduction of maraviroc in rescue regimens in the great majority of patients considered (53 of 66); in 13 cases, maraviroc was given to patients with advanced HIV disease and no immune recovery after 2-3 years of a virologically-effective cART. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (51 cases), raltegravir (49 subjects), and etravirine (36 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (41 cases), liver cirrhosis (21), AIDS-related or other malignancies (20 cases), major cardiovascular events (18 cases), osteonecrosis and haemodialysis-treated kidney failure (3 cases each). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 25 and 13 patients. The addition of maraviroc added favourably to clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of comorbid conditions. HIV viraemia became (or remained) undetectable in 55 patients of 66 (83.3%). An improvement in CD4+ count was observed in all 66 patients, based on a mean 24.9±19.2% increase versus baseline, paralleled by an improvement in mean absolute CD4+ count of 134.7±121.1 cells/μL. A tendency towards an increased mean and peak CD4+ count was observed in the subgroup receiving a maraviroc-raltegravir-based cART. As no clinical-laboratory adverse events attributable to maraviroc occurred, nobody discontinued the study drug. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and anorexia, were reported during maraviroc administration, but their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess because of the multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Our preliminary experience with maraviroc, even considering the limits of the proportionally reduced sample, the patients' salvage stage of advanced disease and the related-unrelated morbidities, underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile."
7381,0.007,7.0000,"Coinfection of blood-borne hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive individuals frequently occurs in inmate population and peculiar viral strains and patterns of virological markers may be observed.Plasma from 69 HIV-1-positive inmates was obtained from 7 clinical centers connected with correctional centers in different towns in Italy. HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
6919,0.007,7.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
2120,0.007,7.0000,"Mutations in the precore region of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with failure of expression of HBV e-antigen (HBeAg), however, the prevalence of these and other mutations in HBV carriers without overt chronic liver disease remains uncertain. Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
990,0.006,6.0000,"Background/Aims HIV continues to be a major public health threat in the United States, and mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the universal effective use of antiretroviral therapy among all HIV-positive individuals (i.e. the ""test and treat"" approach) has the potential to control HIV. However, to accomplish this, all the steps that define the HIV care continuum must be achieved at high levels, including HIV testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in clinical care, antiretroviral medication initiation, and adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The HPTN 065 (Test, Link-to-Care Plus Treat [TLC-Plus]) study was designed to determine the feasibility of the ""test and treat"" approach in the United States. Methods HPTN 065 was conducted in two intervention communities, Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, along with four non-intervention communities, Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA. The study consisted of five components: (1) exploring the feasibility of expanded HIV testing via social mobilization and the universal offer of testing in hospital settings, (2) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase linkage to care, (3) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase viral suppression, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to decrease risk behavior in HIV-positive patients in healthcare settings, and (5) administering provider and patient surveys to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy for prevention and the use of financial incentives to improve health outcomes. The study used observational cohorts, cluster and individual randomization, and made novel use of the existing national HIV surveillance data infrastructure. All components were developed with input from a community advisory board, and pragmatic methods were used to implement and assess the outcomes for each study component. Results A total of 76 sites in Washington, DC, and the Bronx, NY, participated in the study: 37 HIV test sites, including 16 hospitals, and 39 HIV care sites. Between September 2010 and December 2014, all study components were successfully implemented at these sites and resulted in valid outcomes. Our pragmatic approach to the study design, implementation, and the assessment of study outcomes allowed the study to be conducted within established programmatic structures and processes. In addition, it was successfully layered on the ongoing standard of care and existing data infrastructure without disrupting health services. Conclusion The HPTN 065 study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a multi-component ""test and treat"" trial that included a large number of community sites and involved pragmatic approaches to study implementation and evaluation."
4455,0.006,6.0000,"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemic of clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in Nicaragua and to discuss the reasons why the number of HIV patients presenting to the public health care system is increasing compared with other Central American countries. From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
1000,0.006,6.0000,"Golgi protein-73 (GP73) is upregulated in cancers and viral infections; however, its role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains undetermined. GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
7540,0.006,6.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."
1917,0.006,6.0000,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
255,0.006,6.0000,"A patient with HIV infection developed the first episode of AIDS-defining opportunism (severe Candida albicans esophagitis) with an underlying CD4+ lymphocyte count of 1,025 cells/microL. After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."
7090,0.005,5.0000,"Raltegravir, as the first HIV integrase inhibitor, has been used and prospectively monitored since 2010 in our HIV outpatient centre, where over 1,200 patients are monitored. The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "
149,0.005,5.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
9638,0.005,5.0000,"Quantitative assays for viral nucleic acids have been instrumental in monitoring the response of patients to various antiviral therapies. The level of viraemia is predictive of clinical outcome in that a reduced risk of progression to AIDS or death was observed with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Rebound in viral levels often signals therapeutic failures, some of which are associated with the development of drug resistance. Quantitative plasma assays for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been developed. Over time, modifications to these assays have been required to meet new demands. For example, as antiviral therapies have become more effective, HIV and HCV assays of greater sensitivity are required in order to follow patients for longer periods of time and to fully assess the extent of viral suppression. For HIV-1, a large percentage of patients treated with combination therapies had viral loads that were below the detection limit of the ultrasensitive assay (50 copies/ml). To assess the residual viral burden in this patient population an assay to quantify HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was developed. Studies to date indicate that proviral DNA remains easily detectable despite undetectable plasma RNA and may be useful in monitoring this patient population. To increase assay throughput, a new generation of quantitative assays that will provide real-time detection and a 6 log10 detection range from a single amplification is under development."
5110,0.005,5.0000,"Liver-related mortality is increased in the setting of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that HIV infection of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following HIV infection with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular HBsAg when measured by Western blotting, quantitative HBsAg, and fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that HIV infection of HBV-infected hepatic cell lines significantly increased intracellular HBsAg but not HBV DNA synthesis and that increased intrahepatic HBsAg secondary to direct infection by HIV may contribute to accelerated liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals."
619,0.005,5.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."
6689,0.005,5.0000,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
4026,0.005,5.0000,"Objectives The longer survival of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the introduction of the highly active antiretroviral therapy have increased the number of chronic conditions; among these, cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study is to determine patient, disease, and factors associated with peripheral arterial disease in a population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Methods A prospective nested case-control study of a cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was conducted in a tertiary medical center in Mexico City. A sample size of 206 patients was calculated. Medical history, relevant laboratory data, peripheral arterial exam, and screening ankle-brachial index tests were obtained. Results The prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes was 20% (42 patients). Patient's mean age was 44 years ±13. The majority (98.5%) were actively receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; active smoking was reported in 55 (27%), arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in 24 (12%) and 22 (11%) patients. Median time from the human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis was eight years (Interquartile range ±11); the mean CD4 count was 481, with a mean viral load of 13,557 copies (SD ± 69025.27) and 1889.18 (SD ± 9052.77) for patients with normal and abnormal ankle-brachial index and a median of 40 (IQ ± 2). Viral load ( p = 0.04) and number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( p = 0.04) were significantly associated with abnormal ankle-brachial indexes. Conclusions Abnormal ankle-brachial index seems to be more frequent in Mexican patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when compared with the general population at the same age. The most important factors associated with arterial disease were the viral load and the number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
4794,0.005,5.0000,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
4359,0.005,5.0000,"The objective of this study was a comprehensive analysis of the immune-driven evolution of viruses of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clade B in a large patient cohort treated at a single hospital in Germany and its implications for antiretroviral therapy. We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."
5742,0.005,5.0000,"The prevalence of depression is high among injection drug users (IDUs) and among those infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Moreover, one of the drugs used in the standard treatment for HCV infection (interferon) has been known to exacerbate underlying psychiatric disorders such as depression and has been associated with the development of major depressive disorder among HCV-infected patients. For these reasons, the most recent National Institutes of Health consensus statement on the management of HCV infection recommends the identification and treatment of depression prior to the start of HCV treatment. This study aimed to examine the extent of current moderate/severe depressive symptoms in a cohort of HCV-infected IDUs as measured by two screening tools, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Subjects were participants in a multisite behavioral intervention trial among HCV-seropositive, human immunodeficiency virus-negative IDUs aged 18-35 years; the trial was designed to prevent secondary transmission of HCV and to enhance uptake of HCV treatment. Baseline data on demographics, risk behaviors, depression, alcohol use, and health care utilization were measured via audio computer-assisted self-interview. A factor analysis was conducted on each scale to examine the clustering of items used in each to measure depressive symptoms. Baseline depressive symptoms, as measured via the CES-D and the BDI, were also compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Of 193 HCV-infected individuals enrolled to date, 75.6% were male, and 65.3% were white. Median age was 25.8 years. Factor analyses revealed that these scales measured depression differently; a distinct somatic component was present in the BDI, but not the CES-D. Using cutoff scores of 23 for the CES-D and 19 for the BDI, 44.0% and 41.5% of the participants were identified as having moderate/severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Over half (56.0%) were identified as having depressive symptoms by either scale. However, there was only moderate agreement between the two scales (kappa=0.46). Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in this cohort of HCV-infected IDUs. Results indicated that both scales should be used in tandem to have the most sensitive detection of depressive symptoms, thereby maximizing the potential for HCV treatment success."
5894,0.005,5.0000,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."
2034,0.005,5.0000,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
199,0.005,5.0000,"The term 'genotyping' describes the genetic characterization of a genome. The genotype analysis is performed to identify mutations that differentiate one individual or strain from another. The mutations may confer resistance to specific antiviral drugs or they may simply allow classification of a strain as to 'type' and 'subtype'. There are four human viruses for which genotype information is clinically useful. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are being treated with antiretroviral drugs and resistance after prolonged treatment is common. Since HBV cannot be cultured, the only method of detecting resistance-conferring mutations in the genome is a genotypic analysis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured by treatment with the combination of interferon and ribavirin but certain strains of virus are more resistant to treatment than others. The current recommendations are that all HCV type 1 infections be treated for 12 months whereas other types may be successfully treated in 6 months. Since interferon treatment may have significant side effects, the determination of HCV genotype is an important aspect of this therapeutic regimen. Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease with nucleoside analogues occasionally results in resistant virus with mutations in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) and/or the DNA polymerase gene (UL54) that can be tested with phenotypic or genotypic assays. Since CMV grows very slowly, it may be more clinically useful to perform a rapid genotypic assay although only the UL97 gene can be efficiently genotyped. Finally, the virus for which genotyping has become the standard of care, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can now be genotyped routinely by many clinical virology labs experienced with molecular amplification methods and automated DNA sequencing technology. All currently-available antiretroviral drugs are directed against either the protease or reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 and the mutations within these genes that confer resistance have been well described. Sequence-based genotyping methods are not necessarily the best approach for routine genotyping of these four viruses, but sequencing is the gold standard from which other methods are developed and against which they are compared."
1656,0.005,5.0000,"One thousand one hundred fifty-two HIV-1-positive patients were screened for HTLV-2 infection, and the AIDS-free coinfected individuals were consecutively included in a longitudinal study with the aim of investigating the role of HTLV-2 in the progression to AIDS and the development of specific neurologic diseases. Two matched HIV-1-positive/HTLV-2-negative controls for each coinfected individual were also enrolled in the study. HTLV-2 infection was found in 95 (8.2%) of the HIV-1-positive patients, 30 of whom were followed up for a median of 28.5 months. No significant differences were observed between them and the patients infected with HIV-1 alone in terms of the rate of decline in CD4 cell counts, progression to AIDS, or AIDS mortality, but they had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.0; p =.009). One coinfected patient developed myelopathy during the follow-up. In the second part of the study, aimed at preliminarily assessing the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, we extended our observations to two groups of coinfected and singly infected individuals receiving HAART. An 80% decrease in incidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed among both groups without any significant difference between them. These results support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 plays a role in the development of neurologic abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients and suggest that the immune reconstitution due to HAART may limit the activity of HTLV-2 as an opportunistic agent."
6893,0.005,5.0000,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
422,0.004,4.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is associated with poor graft- and patient-survival. Treatment with HBV-specific immunoglobulins (HBIG) in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogs is effective in preventing HBV reinfection of the graft and improving OLT outcome. However, the role of HBV-specific cellular immunity in viral containment in immune suppressed patients in general and in OLT recipients in particular is unclear. To test whether or not OLT recipients maintain robust HBV-specific cellular immunity, the cellular immune response against HBV was assessed in 15 OLT recipients and 27 individuals with chronic and 24 subjects with self-limited HBV infection, respectively; using an overlapping peptide set spanning the viral nucleocapsid- and envelope-protein sequences. The data demonstrate that OLT recipients mounted fewer but stronger clusters of differentiation (CD)8 T cell responses than subjects with self-limited HBV infection and showed a preferential targeting of the nucleocapsid antigen. This focused response pattern was similar to responses seen in chronically infected subjects with undetectable viremia, but significantly different from patients who presented with elevated HBV viremia and who mounted mainly immune responses against the envelope protein. In conclusion, virus-specific CD4 T cell-mediated responses were only detected in subjects with self-limited HBV infection. Thus, the profile of the cellular immunity against HBV was in immune suppressed patients similar to subjects with chronic HBV infection with suppressed HBV-DNA."
6847,0.004,4.0000,"Children and adolescents are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission occurs through perinatal exposures, injecting drug use, consensual and nonconsensual sex, needle-stick and sharp injuries, and possibly some unusual contacts. Youth engaging in high-risk sexual activities are especially endangered. Half of the estimated worldwide 5.3 million new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24. Of 20 000 known new adult and adolescent cases in the United States, 25% involve 13- to 21-year-olds. More than 1.4 million children worldwide (aged 15 and younger) are believed to be infected, and >1640 new cases are diagnosed daily. Of the 432 000 people reported to be living with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, 5575 are children under 13. HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of secondary HIV prevention that may reduce the incidence of HIV infections. HIV PEP is commonly conceived of as 2 types: occupational and nonoccupational. Occupational HIV PEP is an accepted form of therapy for health care workers exposed to HIV through their jobs. A landmark study of healthcare workers concluded that occupational HIV PEP may be efficacious. Well-established US national guidelines for occupational HIV PEP exist for this at-risk population. Nonoccupational HIV PEP includes all other forms of HIV PEP, such as that given after sexual assault and consensual sex, injecting drug use, and needle-stick and sharp injuries in non-health care persons. Pediatric HIV PEP is typically the nonoccupational type. The efficacy of nonoccupational HIV PEP is unknown. The presumed efficacy is based on a collection of animal and human data concerning occupational, perinatal, and nonoccupational exposures to HIV. In contrast to occupational HIV PEP, there are no national US guidelines for nonoccupational HIV PEP, and few recommendations are available for its use for adolescents and children. Regardless of this absence, there is encouraging evidence supporting the value of HIV PEP in its various forms in pediatrics. Although unproven, the presumed mechanism for HIV PEP comes from animal and human work suggesting that shortly after an exposure to HIV, a window period exists during which the viral load is small enough to be controlled by the body's immune system. Antiretroviral medications given during this period may help to diminish or end viral replication, thereby reducing the viral inoculum to a more potentially manageable target for the host's defenses. HIV PEP is accepted practice in the perinatal setting and for health care workers with occupational injuries. The medical literature supports prescribing HIV PEP after community needle-stick and sharp injuries and after sexual assault from sources known or likely to be HIV-infected. HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between HIV sero-opposite partners has had growing use in the adult population, and can probably be utilized for children and adolescents. There is less documented experience and support for HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between partners of unknown HIV status, after prolonged or multiple episodes of sexual abuse from an assailant of unknown HIV status, after bites, and after the sharing of personal hygiene items or exposure to wounds of HIV-infected individuals. There are no formal guidelines for HIV PEP in adolescents and children. A few groups have commented on its provision in pediatrics, and some preliminary studies have been released. Our article provides a discussion of the data available on HIV transmission and HIV PEP in pediatrics. In our article, we propose an HIV PEP approach for adolescents and children. We recommend a stratified regimen, based on the work of Gerberding and Katz and other authors, that attempts to match seroconversion risk with an appropriate number of medications, while taking into account adverse side-effects and the amount of information that is typically available upon initial presentation. Twice daily regimens should be used when possible, and may improve compliance. HIV PEP should be administered within 1 hour of exposure. We strongly recommend that physicians trained in this form of therapy review the indications for HIV PEP within 72 hours of its provision. We advocate that due diligence in determining level of risk and appropriateness of drug selection be conducted as soon as possible after an exposure has occurred. When such information is not immediately available, we recommend the rapid treatment using the maximum level of care followed by careful investigation and reconsideration in follow-up or whenever possible. HIV PEP may be initiated provisionally after an exposure and then discontinued if the exposure source is confirmed to not be HIV-infected. In most cases, consultations with the experts in HIV care can occur after the rapid start of therapy. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"
9347,0.004,4.0000,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
9340,0.004,4.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is classified into eight major genotypes, A-H, which are geographically distributed worldwide. The aim of this work was to describe the clinical characteristics associated with the HBV genotypes circulating in Buenos Aires city. The study included 139 patients infected with HBV, whose clinical courses were classified as acute symptomatic self-limiting hepatitis, inactive carrier state and chronic active hepatitis (HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative). The HBV genotypes were determined in 128 patients by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis. Biochemical, virological, clinical and histological features were analysed. A differential distribution of genotypes between acute symptomatic and chronic infections was found. Among the acute cases, genotype F was predominant (65.2%, 30/46) and genotype D was rare (4.3%, 2/46), whereas among the chronic infections, a homogeneous distribution of genotypes A (26.8%, 22/82), D (31.7%, 26/82) and F (36.6%, 30/82), with an unusual presence of genotypes B (1.2%, 1/82) and C (3.7%, 3/82), was observed. Regarding the liver histology of chronically infected patients, genotype F tended to display higher histological activity indexes. Mutations related to HBV surface antigen immunoreactivity, antiviral resistance and HBeAg-negative status were studied. This work constitutes, to our knowledge, the first description of the clinical characteristics related to HBV genotypes in Argentina, where the distribution of genotypes in patients with acute infection has not been reported previously. Finally, it was established that genotype F is the prevalent genotype among the acute symptomatic infections in Buenos Aires city, and that it shows a tendency to cause an adverse disease outcome among the chronic cases."
5528,0.004,4.0000,"To report long-term data on safety and effectiveness of antiretroviral regimens, including nevirapine. HIV-1-infected patients who received nevirapine-based approaches for at least 4 years were identified in the databases of five centers and included in a retrospective cohort study. Data collected included plasma HIV-RNA (viral load) and CD4+ T-cell counts, lipid and liver function tests, at baseline, 2-year and > 4-year time points. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, adverse events, and reasons for using nevirapine were also recorded. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients (139 males/90 females) were included. The mean age was 37 years (range 20-59). Most patients (n = 124; 54%) were former intravenous drug users. One hundred and thirty-five of the patients (59%) were coinfected with HCV. Median time on nevirapine was 72.6 months. The main reasons for nevirapine use included: second- or third-line therapy (39%), simplification of therapy (29%), first-line therapy (18%) and efavirenz intolerance (9%). LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased during the >4-year follow-up (135 mg/dl to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.04; and 216 mg/dl to 153 mg/dl, p<0.01, respectively), and HDL cholesterol increased from 48 mg/dl at baseline to 62 mg/dl (p<0.01). Liver enzymes remained without significant changes during follow-up. The reported follow-up pattern of laboratory tests was also found in the subset of HCV-coinfected patients, where men and women were compared and patients with a CD4+ cell count cut-off value of 250/mm(3) were stratified. Mean CD4+ T-cell counts increased from 439/mm(3) at baseline to 628/mm(3) at the last available visit (p<0.001). Ninety-four per cent (172 out of 184) of patients who remained on nevirapine-based therapy at last visit maintained viral load values below the limit of detection (<50 copies/ml). Throughout the follow-up nevirapine was stopped or withdrawn in 43 patients due to virological failure (n = 17), toxicity (n = 5), therapy interruption (n = 3), death (n = 2), dyslipidemia (n = 1), simplification (n = 1) or unknown reasons (n = 14). Adverse events were reported in 40 patients but none was directly attributed to nevirapine. Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy provides sustained immunological and virological effectiveness over a more than 4-year treatment period as well as a beneficial lipid metabolic profile and a favorable safety profile, even in HCV-coinfected patients and women with CD4+ cell counts above 250/mm(3). The study data support a nevirapine-based approach as a suitable long-term strategy in the HIV-1-infected population."
7661,0.004,4.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR. 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions are critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. In general, treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replicatioing a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website ( http://www.hivatis.org )."
4320,0.004,4.0000,"Following global efforts to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) access in Sub-Saharan Africa, ART coverage among HIV-infected Cameroonians increased from 0% in 2003 to 22% in 2014. However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (≤40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."
1717,0.004,4.0000,"Albania is a Mediterranean country, still with a high endemicity level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The chronic hepatitis B profile was characterized in this geographical area and used as a model to investigate the impact of endemicity level on the prevalence of the two major forms of chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B). A cross-sectional study was conducted among 62 chronic hepatitis B patients consecutively admitted to the most important tertiary health care center for the diagnosis and treatment of liver disease in Albania. HBV-DNA was measured with an in-house PCR with a sensitivity of 10(4) copies/ml which uses primers encompassing the pre-core/core region. PCR products were subjected to sequencing and oligohybridization assay. Of the 62 patients, 75.8% had HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Genotype D was found in all 39 patients with detectable HBV viremia, for whom the heterogeneity of the region modulating HBeAg expression was assessed. Basic core promoter (BCP) mutations (1762/1764) were observed more often in anti-HBe-positive and older patients. In more than 90% of the HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients with detectable viremia, HBV that carries the G to A pre-core mutation at nucleotide 1896 was found. Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were younger than HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients, and for symptomatic and asymptomatic liver-disease patients, the age of peak prevalence was at least 10 years lower for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. In conclusion, the virological and clinical pattern of chronic hepatitis B in Albania is similar to that observed in other Mediterranean countries; it seems to be independent of the HBV endemicity level."
717,0.004,4.0000,"The emerging presence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection in the United States has been the focus of much attention among health care providers and the general population. Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a dramatic increase in hepatitis C disease. During the 1980s and early 1990s, hepatitis C was viewed as a disease for which little could be done, both because of ineffective treatment and the severity and lack of adequate treatments for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) itself. Treatment with interferon had poor effect on hepatitis C in the co-infected population, especially for those with advanced immunosuppression. The regimen was difficult to tolerate even with dose reductions. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective treatment and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, a substantial portion of HIV-infected patients are living long enough to have their health compromised by hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma owing to hepatitis C, rather than by AIDS-related illness. New treatments are available for hepatitis C, with preliminary research yielding promising results. The role of these medications in managing HIV/HCV co-infection is currently under study, with implications for many. Health care providers are increasingly faced with the challenges of caring for people infected with the hepatitis C virus, and the growing number of individuals co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of hepatitis C, especially in the presence of HIV infection, and to detail the recognition and management of the care of this emerging population."
7248,0.004,4.0000,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
9345,0.004,4.0000,"Co-infection of HBV with HIV results in an accelerated course of HBV-associated chronic liver disease. Several studies have shown that viral mutations are related to disease progression in mono-infection with HBV. However, it is unclear whether HBV mutation patterns might differ between co-infected and mono-infected patients. To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-naïve co-infected and 31 treatment-naïve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients. Thus, HBV mutations may not contribute to disease pathogenesis in Thai patients with co-infection."
13,0.004,4.0000,"No consistently effective therapy is yet available for the treatment of chronic HBsAg, anti-HBe, HBV-DNA-positive hepatitis. A multicenter trial has shown that the response rates are not significantly different when patients with anti-HBe-positive hepatitis are treated with six-month course of thymosin-alpha1 or of interferon-alpha. However, since among these patients, interferon's real efficacy is still debated, with sustained biochemical response achieved in only a few of the treated patients, we conducted this controlled study to investigate the safety and efficacy of thymosin-alpha1 as compared with no treatment. Forty-four chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, who were anti-HBe- and HBV-DNA-positive, were randomized, with stratification for the presence of cirrhosis at baseline liver biopsy, to receive either thymosin-alpha1 at a dose of 900 microg/m2 twice a week for six months or no treatment. At entry, both groups of patients were comparable for sex, age, liver histology, ALT, IgM anti-HBc, and HBV-DNA levels. Forty-two patients were followed-up for 20 months (median; range 12-32 months) after completion of therapy: one dropped out, and one developed hepatocellular carcinoma at six months. Thymosin-alpha1 treatment had no side effects. Six months after the end of the therapy, HBV-DNA was negative and ALT had normalized in 14% of treated cases and in 4.5% of control group, while IgM anti-HBc was negative (<0.200) in 14% of the treated patients and in 4.5% of the controls. Among the treated patients, the median ALT levels stayed significantly lower compared to the pretreatment values during the treatment period and six months of follow-up. During the first year, there were six flares of hepatitis in the control group and five among the treated patients (P = NS), yielding a per year average of 0.3 and 0.23 flares per patient, respectively. Among the treated patients, median IgM anti-HBc levels were low with respect to baseline values 4-10 months after treatment started. None became HBsAg negative. In conclusion, these results indicate that, in anti-HBe, HBV-DNA-positive chronic hepatitis B, thymosin-alpha1 therapy alone does not increase the response rate, but may contribute to reduce the immune-mediated liver cell necrosis as indirectly assessed by ALT and IgM anti-HBc levels."

Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
7873,0.004,4.0000,"Severe hepatotoxicity is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect of antiretroviral therapy. In this case report we describe an HIV-positive patient who was admitted to our clinic with evidence of severe acute pancreatitis 18 months after the introduction of antiretroviral treatment, which included stavudine and didanosine. Shortly afterwards, she developed lactate acidosis and acute hepatic failure associated with renal failure. Renal support (hemofiltration) was required for three days. The patient subsequently developed grade III encephalopathy, as well as a large pleural effusion and ascites. Although the reported outcome of patients with liver failure due to antiretroviral treatment is poor, with a high mortality rate, our patient fully recovered after intensive supportive care and cessation of the antiretroviral agents. Liver biopsy revealed microvesicular steatosis and giant mitochondria, which are the typical hallmarks of mitochondrial damage, the presumed mechanism of antiretroviral drug toxicity. More than three years later the patient has an excellent clinical status with a stable HIV infection and no need for antiretroviral treatment. This case report indicates the need for increased awareness of the potential hepatotoxicity of an antiretroviral therapy, as severe side effects may occur more frequently with increasing use of such treatment."
2343,0.004,4.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
8419,0.004,4.0000,"We present a case report of a Japanese patient who showed prolonged infection after acute hepatitis B with genotype H. The patient was a 60-year-old man who underwent an annual health care check every year for several years and was never pointed out to have any liver damage, and markers for hepatitis B and C were negative. He was found to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at his health care check in December 2005. After one month, he had an elevated aminotransferase level with hepatitis B e antigen and a high level of serum HBV DNA. He was diagnosed as having acute hepatitis B. On HBV genotype, he had genotype H by the direct sequence method, and he was given a 100 mg of lamivudine daily. However, his acute hepatitis tended to go toward prolonged infection. After two months, he was treated with interferon daily for 28 days. He had negative HBsAg in August 2006. Genotype H, the newest type of hepatitis B, could be the type which shows a poor response to lamivudine. The present paper is the first report, describing the clinical course of acute hepatitis B with genotype H from onset to remission."
3505,0.004,4.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
2006,0.004,4.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate immune cytokine expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) using a novel cytokine array assay. HIV-1 induces a condition resembling classical subcortical dementia, known as HAD. The immune mechanisms contributing to HAD have not been elucidated. Cytokine expression in CSF was determined by solid-phase protein array in 33 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive male patients and were compared to levels in non-HIV controls and patients with HAD. Neurological examinations and lumbar and venous punctures were conducted in all patients and controls. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, and IL-10, were up-regulated in all treated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients independent of neurological status compared to controls. In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-1alpha, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were highly expressed in patients with HAD compared to undemented HIV-positive patients. These results show that solid-phase protein array can detect immunological changes in patients infected with HIV. Cytokine expression levels differ in different disease stages and in patients on different treatment paradigms. Pending further validation on a larger number of patients, this method may be a useful tool in CSF diagnostics and the longitudinal evaluation of patient with HAD."
6125,0.004,4.0000,"Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event."
5254,0.004,4.0000,"The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a man (VH) homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation were investigated, and coreceptors other than CCR5 used by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from this individual were identified. In contrast to previous reports, this individual's rate of disease progression was not accelerated. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32 mutation was demonstrated by PCR and DNA sequencing (R. Biti et al., Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997). CCR5 surface expression was absent on T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV was isolated by coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from siblings who were homozygous (VM) or wild type (WT) for the CCR5Delta32 mutation. The virus demonstrated dual tropism for infection of MT2 cell line and primary macrophages. Sequencing of the full HIV genome directly from the patient's PBMCs revealed 21 nucleotide insertions in the V1 region of gp120. The VH envelope sequence segregated apart from both the T-cell-line-adapted tropic strains NL4-3 and SF2 and M-tropic strain JRFL or YU2 by phylogenetic tree analysis. VH was shown to utilize predominantly CXCR4 for entry into T lymphocytes and macrophages by HOS.CD4 cell infection assay, direct envelope protein fusion, and inhibition by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12G5), SDF-1, and AMD3100. Microsatellite mapping demonstrated the separate inheritance of CXCR4 by both homozygote brothers (VH and VM). Our study demonstrates the ability of certain strains of HIV to readily use CXCR4 for infection or entry into macrophages, which is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of late-stage disease and presumably also HIV transmission."
2416,0.004,4.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

2108,0.004,4.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a progressive condition which may cause endothelial dysfunction and liver damage leading to coagulopathy. With adventure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), life expectancy has prolonged in HIV positive patients but several acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related conditions such as coagulopathies are responsible for associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation, serum level of fibrinogen and platelet count in HIV positive patients and compare it with negative healthy individuals. Through a case-control study, 114 HIV seropositive patients were compared with 114 seronegative samples in terms of hematological and other coagulation parameters. Mean age of study patients was 37.48 years. Intra venous drug abuse was the most common route of infection transmission with a prevalence of more than 50%. HIV route of transmission had a direct relationship with PTT abnormal levels (P&lt;0.0001). However, this relationship was not significant for PT values. Stages of HIV disease and administration of HAART did not reveal any significant relationship with PT and PTT. There was also a statistically significant correlation between CD4+&lt; 200 and PT in case group (P=0.008). On the other hands, in control group, CD4+ had a weak relationship with PTT (P=0.02) and an inverse correlation with serum fibrinogen (P=0.013). Hematological parameters and serum fibrinogen are decreased in HIV positive patients especially in direct relation with CD4+ cell count&lt;200 cell/µl. PT and PTT abnormal values are also more prevalent in this population. "
9026,0.004,4.0000,"Many HIV-infected women are not realizing the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite significant advancements in treatment. Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) are highly marginalized and struggle with multiple morbidities, unstable housing, addiction, survival sex, and elevated risk of sexual and drug-related harms, including HIV infection. Although recent studies have identified the heightened risk of HIV infection among women engaged in sex work and injection drug use, the uptake of HIV care among this population has received little attention. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the needs of women engaged in survival sex work and to assess utilization and acceptance of HAART. During November 2003, a baseline needs assessment was conducted among 159 women through a low-threshold drop-in centre servicing street-level sex workers in Vancouver. Cross-sectional data were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and status, and attitudes towards HAART. High rates of cocaine injection, heroin injection, and smokeable crack cocaine use reflect the vulnerable and chaotic nature of this population. Although preliminary findings suggest an overall high uptake of health and social services, there was limited attention to HIV care with only 9% of the women on HAART. Self-reported barriers to accessing treatment were largely attributed to misinformation and misconceptions about treatment. Given the acceptability of accessing HAART through community interventions and women specific services, this study highlights the potential to reach this highly marginalized group and provides valuable baseline information on a population that has remained largely outside consistent HIV care."
4038,0.004,4.0000,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV.

8861,0.004,4.0000,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."

The majority of patients were men infected with HIV in through intravenous drug using and had a CD4 cell count <200cells/microl at the time of TB diagnosis. The most frequent form of TB was pulmonary localization and lymphadenitis as extrapulmonary localization. Meningitis was recognized in two cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive culture for mycobacteria and PCR in 34/36 patients. Mycobacterial smears were positive in 2/36 cases, the skin test reaction with nodule >5mm was positive in 60% cases. Immune reconstruction syndrome was recognized in 4 patients."
7542,0.004,4.0000,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an important public health issue, because it may affect the outcome of antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
5732,0.004,4.0000,"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor antagonist currently in clinical trials for treatment of R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."
5219,0.004,4.0000,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
5953,0.004,4.0000,"The oral deoxyguanosine nucleoside analogue entecavir (Baraclude®) has potent activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a high genetic barrier to resistance. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. Entecavir 1 mg/day was more effective than adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, according to the results of a randomized, open-label, multicentre trial. Patients were either nucleos(t)ide naive or lamivudine experienced. The reduction from baseline in HBV DNA levels at week 24 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil. The proportion of patients with HBV DNA levels of <300 copies/mL was also significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil at weeks 24, 48 and 96, as was the proportion of patients with ALT normalization. Entecavir 0.5 or 1 mg/day, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg/day and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200 mg/300 mg per day were effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, according to the 48-week analysis of a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial, primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints. In this trial, over one-third of patients had received previous therapy with lamivudine for ≥6 months. The efficacy of entecavir in treatment-naive patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis did not significantly differ from that seen in patients with chronic hepatitis B or compensated cirrhosis (compensated group), according to the results of a prospective, nonrandomized study. After 6 or 12 months of entecavir treatment, there were no significant differences between the decompensated and compensated groups in virological, biochemical or serological endpoints. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, significant improvements from baseline in liver function were seen after 12 months of entecavir therapy. Oral entecavir was generally well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, with most of the reported treatment-emergent adverse events consistent with decompensated liver disease. In the trial primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints, there was no significant difference between patients receiving entecavir and those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with or without emtricitabine in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing tolerability failure or the proportion of patients with confirmed increases in serum creatinine levels of ≥0.5 mg/dL above baseline or confirmed serum phosphorus levels of <2.0 mg/dL at week 48 (co-primary endpoints). It has been suggested that the risk of lactic acidosis associated with oral nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy is increased in patients with highly impaired liver function. However, only one case of lactic acidosis was reported among entecavir recipients across two clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease. Moreover, small studies found that the risk of lactic acidosis was not increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease who received entecavir, compared with patients with non-HBV decompensated liver disease. In conclusion, entecavir is a valuable agent for the first-line treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease."
9217,0.004,4.0000,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."

Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "
3238,0.004,4.0000,"Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common worldwide. The current guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection recommend that HIV patients coinfected with HBV receive antiretoroviral therapy (ART) with two nucleoside analogs against HBV. However, an increase in liver enzymes that is usually attributed to HBV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) sometimes occurs in HBV/HIV-coinfected patients after the commencement of ART. We report a case of HBV/HIV-coinfection in which the chronic hepatitis B was successfully treated using interferon (IFN) therapy followed by ART without the development of IRIS. A Japanese man in thirties was referred to our hospital because of an acute HIV infection two months after the diagnosis of an acute HBV infection, which had progressed to a chronic HBV infection. The laboratory test results were as follows:hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive, HBV DNA level of 8.8 Log copies/mL, HBV genotype A, alanine aminotransferase of 834 IU/L, HIV RNA level of 5 Log copies/mL, and a CD4+ T cell count of 437/microL. The initial treatment was natural IFNalpha therapy for chronic hepatitis B, and HBeAg seroclearance was achieved 20 weeks after the start of therapy. Four months after the end of IFN therapy for 24 weeks, ART including tenofovir and emtricitabine against HBV was commenced. Six months after starting ART, the patient's serum HBV DNA level had decreased and become undetectable and HBsAg seroclearance was achieved without an elevation in liver enzymes. The present case suggests that IFN therapy prior to ART contributes to a successful outcome for chronic hepatitis B patients coinfected with HIV, if the HIV status does not require the immediate start of ART."
8390,0.004,4.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
9304,0.004,4.0000,"Since January 25, 1988, the Baltimore City Health Department has offered routine, confidential, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing to clients of the city's two sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. During the first 11 months of the program, testing was offered at 20,843 patient visits and was accepted at 15,181 (73%) of these; 612 (4%) individual clients had results that were positive for HIV. Four hundred thirty-seven (71%) seropositive clients returned for test results, post-test counseling, and further evaluation. Most HIV-infected clients were single, and black men accounted for 75% of seropositive individuals. HIV-infected women tended to be younger than infected men (7% of the female clients were adolescents). Although homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and sex with a partner at risk were common risk factors for seropositive clients, after two interviews 17% of men and 38% of infected women did not report traditional risk factors for HIV infection. Most clients were asymptomatic or had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of HIV diagnosis. Health care resources for these individuals were limited; 62% of men and 85% of women either had no health insurance or received public assistance. Routine, voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing is a practical, effective means to identify HIV-infected individuals among clients being treated at STD clinics. Identification of these individuals early in the course of infection provides opportunities to implement early follow-up and therapy, to counsel clients to help prevent further spread of infection, and to obtain useful information for projecting future health care needs and policy."
2026,0.003,3.0000,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."
5531,0.003,3.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
9616,0.003,3.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is the Lentivirus responsible for an immunodeficiency-like disease in domestic cats (Felis catus). FIV is divided into five phylogenetic subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E), based on genetic diversity. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of subtypes is relevant for understanding different disease progressions and for vaccine development. In this study, viral sequences of 26 infected cats from Rio de Janeiro, 8 undergoing treatment with zidovudine (AZT) for at least 5 years, were successfully amplified from blood specimens. gag capsid (CA), pol reverse transcriptase (RT), and env gp120 (V3-V4) regions were analyzed to determine subtypes and to evaluate potential mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance among treated cats. Subtyping based on phylogenetic analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. All of the sequences clustered with subtype B in the three regions, exhibiting low genetic variability. Additionally, we found evidence that the same virus is circulating in animals in close contact. The analysis of FIV RT sequences identified two new putative mutations related to drug resistance located in the RT ""finger"" domain, which has 60% identity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence. Amino acid change K-->R at codons 64 and 69 was found in 25% and 37.5% of the treated animals, respectively. These signatures were comparable to K65R and K70R thymidine-associated mutations found in the HIV-1 HXB2 counterpart. This finding strongly suggests a position correlation between the mutations found in FIV and the K65R and K70R substitutions from drug-resistant HIV-1 strains."
5453,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."
7180,0.003,3.0000,"Identifying microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential in wild-living primates can be important to human health, as evidenced by human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and Ebola virus. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ancient retroviruses that infect Old and New World monkeys and apes. Although not known to cause disease, these viruses are of public health interest because they have the potential to infect humans and thus provide a more general indication of zoonotic exposure risks. Surprisingly, no information exists concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity of SFVs in wild-living monkeys and apes. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of SFVcpz infection in free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using newly developed, fecal-based assays. Chimpanzee fecal samples (n = 724) were collected at 25 field sites throughout equatorial Africa and tested for SFVcpz-specific antibodies (n = 706) or viral nucleic acids (n = 392). SFVcpz infection was documented at all field sites, with prevalence rates ranging from 44% to 100%. In two habituated communities, adult chimpanzees had significantly higher SFVcpz infection rates than infants and juveniles, indicating predominantly horizontal rather than vertical transmission routes. Some chimpanzees were co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz); however, there was no evidence that SFVcpz and SIVcpz were epidemiologically linked. SFVcpz nucleic acids were recovered from 177 fecal samples, all of which contained SFVcpz RNA and not DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial gag (616 bp), pol-RT (717 bp), and pol-IN (425 bp) sequences identified a diverse group of viruses, which could be subdivided into four distinct SFVcpz lineages according to their chimpanzee subspecies of origin. Within these lineages, there was evidence of frequent superinfection and viral recombination. One chimpanzee was infected by a foamy virus from a Cercopithecus monkey species, indicating cross-species transmission of SFVs in the wild. These data indicate that SFVcpz (i) is widely distributed among all chimpanzee subspecies; (ii) is shed in fecal samples as viral RNA; (iii) is transmitted predominantly by horizontal routes; (iv) is prone to superinfection and recombination; (v) has co-evolved with its natural host; and (vi) represents a sensitive marker of population structure that may be useful for chimpanzee taxonomy and conservation strategies."
3939,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase (RT) is encoded by the polymerase gene in the reverse transcriptase region, which overlaps with the S gene. The association between mutations of HBV RT and the pathobiological features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to examine mutations in this region of the HBV genome and its clinical significance. Briefly, HBV total DNA was extracted from 84 pairs of HCC tumor tissue and corresponding adjacent non‑tumor tissue samples. The RT/S regions (nt130‑1161) were amplified and sequenced using the Sanger method, and associations between RT mutations and the clinical characteristics of patients with HCC were analyzed. Finally, 27 and 29 mutations with frequencies >5% were identified in the RT and S regions, respectively. The rtF221Y variation and a tumor size >8 cm were found to be independent risk factors for the postoperative recurrence of HCC, with hazard ratios of 2.345 (95% CI, 1.391‑3.953; P=0.001) and 1.838 (95% CI, 1.069‑3.161; P=0.028), respectively. rtF221Y was also an independent risk factor for poor overall survival rates (HR=2.557; 95% CI, 1.344‑4.866; P=0.004). The mutation of R122 K in the HBV S protein was closely associated with tumor recurrence (P<0.001). As a result, rtF221Y was identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis and may be a potential viral marker for predicting prognosis in HCC."
9849,0.003,3.0000,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described. Serum transaminases were elevated. Serological assays showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies but no antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) antibodies. Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3760,0.003,3.0000,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
8717,0.003,3.0000,"HCV exists within its host as pools of related genetic variants referred to as quasispecies. The hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of the E2 envelope gene is subjected to strong selective pressure from neutralizing antibodies. The genetic complexity of this region is defined as the total number of genetic variants within the quasispecies population. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 region was examined in patients with chronic hepatitis C and its relationship with the epidemiology of HCV infection, and its influence on liver disease and the response to interferon treatment were determined in 114 patients with chronic hepatitis C. The genetic complexity of the HVR1 major variants was measured before treatment by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique, and was compared with epidemiological, clinical, virological and histological features. The patients were treated with 3 megaunits of interferon (IFN) alfa for 3 to 6 months and the response to treatment was assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months. The HVR1 could be studied in 101 of the 114 patients (89%). Genetic complexity was significantly higher in patients infected through blood transfusion than intravenous drug use (mean complexity index: 5.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.5, respectively; P = 0.04). This relationship was independent of age and the estimated time since infection. No significant relationship was found with other parameters of infection or liver disease. In univariate analysis, the genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants did not affect the rates of ALT normalization at months 3 and 6 of IFN treatment. HVR1 genetic complexity was lower in patients with a sustained virological response than in non-responders (4.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0, respectively; P = 0.07). In multivariate analysis of pretreatment parameters associated with a sustained virological response to treatment, three parameters appeared to be independent predictors of such a response: a low viral load (P < 0.04), a low anti-HCV core IgM titer (P = 0.03) and a low genetic complexity of HVR1 major variants (P < 0.04). In conclusion, the HVR1 of HCV has a quasispecies distribution in infected individuals. Its genetic complexity is significantly higher in transfusion recipients than in intravenous drug users, suggesting that the size of the initial inoculum affects the later emergence and development of viral quasispecies. The genetic complexity of HVR1, together with viral load and the anti-HCV IgM titer, are independent predictors of a sustained virological response to IFN alfa in patients with chronic hepatitis."
8048,0.003,3.0000,"Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 represents a major problem in many regions of the world, especially Southern Africa. With the exception of viral and proviral load, the role for maternal cofactors in perinatal transmission outcome is largely unknown. In this study, an assessment was made of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene-expression profiles to better understand transcriptional changes associated with HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission among young adult mothers with infants in Botswana. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens were used from 25 HIV+ drug naive and 20 HIV- healthy mothers, similar in age and location, collected in 1999-2000 and 2003, and processed with the exact same methods, as previously described. Expression profiling of 22 277 microarray gene probes implicated a broad initiation of innate response gene-sets, including toll-like receptor, interferon-stimulated and antiviral RNA response pathways in association with maternal HIV-1 infection. Maternal transmission status was further associated with host genes that influence RNA processing and splicing patterns. In addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of specific genes, enriched category validation of PBMC profiles was conducted using two independent data sets for either HIV-1 infection or an unrelated RNA virus, severe acute respiratory virus infection. HIV-1 pathogen-specific host profiles should prove a useful tool in infection and transmission intervention efforts worldwide."
1514,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can evolve by mutations in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) to permit its escape from neutralization by antibodies such as HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs) and from host immune responses. This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."
8101,0.003,3.0000,"We performed a quantitative study of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, including new parameters such as pre-S1 antigen (Ag), pre-S2 Ag, and anti-HBx, in 88 chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. New IMx assays for HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc detection were also used. The population studied was composed of 65 chronic hepatitis cases (40 positive for hepatitis B antigen [HBeAg] and 25 positive for anti-HBe) and 23 anti-HBe-positive, asymptomatic HBsAg carriers. Serum HBsAg levels detected by IMx were higher in HBeAg-positive than in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers (all patient subgroups included) and correlated with the serum HBV DNA level (P = 0.0001). Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ags were detected by enzyme immunoassays in almost all HBsAg carriers. Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ag titers correlated positively with the serum HBsAg concentration (P = 0.0001), but only the pre-S1 Ag titer correlated with the level of serum HBV DNA (P = 0.02). The detection of low levels of IgM anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibodies by IMx was associated with the presence of liver disease (P = 0.05) but not with the level of viral replication. The prevalence of anti-HBx antibodies detected by the enzyme immunoassay was slightly, although not significantly, higher in patients with high levels of HBV DNA (greater than 100 pg/ml) than in patients without detectable HBV DNA (P = 0.16). In anti-HBe-positive chronic HBsAg carriers, the quantitative detection of serum HBV DNA, pre-S Ag titers, and IgM anti HBc allowed us to predict which patients suffered from chronic liver disease and/or supported viral replication (P < 0.05). In a follow-up study of eight patients undergoing antiviral therapy, the clearance of both pre-S1 Ag and HBV DNA was associated with a subsequent clearance of HBV. Therefore, the quantitative determination of HBV DNA, pre-S Ags, IgM anti-HBc may prove useful for the decision to use and the monitoring of antiviral therapy, especially in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers."
1939,0.003,3.0000,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
2483,0.003,3.0000,"Thalassemia is a congenital hemolytic disease caused by defective globin synthesis treated by blood transfusion. Transfusion-transmitted infections still make a great challenge in the management of patients with thalassemia major. The most important worldwide transfusion-transmitted infections are hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. The objective of this study is to update the prevalence of the three major transfusion-transmitted infections HCV, HBV and HIV among thalassemic patients followed up in the Hematology Department, Children Hospital, Cairo University. The study included 174 multitransfused thalassemic patients (162 major and 12 intermedia), registered at the Pediatric Hematology Clinic, Cairo University. Their age ranged from 2 to 27 years with a mean of 11.26 ± 5.4 years. Patients were subjected to full history taking, stressing on history of blood transfusions (onset, frequency and duration) at a single or multiple centers and abdominal examination. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), ferritin and viral markers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and anti-HIV were assayed for all cases by a third-generation ELISA method. HCV PCR was performed for 75 cases. Of the 174 patients, none of them were HBsAg and anti-HIV positive. However, 90 patients were anti-HCV positive (51.7%). HCV PCR was positive in 56 patients (74.3%) of the 75 with positive antibody tested. HCV antibody positivity is statistically significant with age of the patient, serum ferritin and liver transaminases (P < 0.01). HCV-RNA by PCR positivity was significantly related to patients' age and serum ferritin (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin showed statistically significant positive correlation with liver transaminases. Despite the decrease in prevalence of HCV antibody in our patients from 71% in 1995 to 51.7% in our study, yet HCV infection still represents a major health problem for our thalassemic patients, which requires more attention and efforts to challenge. There is a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of HBV infection over the last decade, thanks to mass compulsory vaccination and blood screening. HIV infection does not represent a problem owing to very low population prevalence."
3010,0.003,3.0000,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
3109,0.003,3.0000,"The growing number of cases of acute hepatitis C (AHC) infections among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in the last 10 years has promoted the search for predictors of AHC clearance as well as for epidemiological networks of viral transmission. We characterized the diversity and catalytic efficiency of HCV NS3/4A protease quasispecies in AHC patients coinfected with HIV-1. Plasma samples obtained at HCV diagnosis from 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients with AHC were studied. Five HCV monoinfected patient samples with AHC were also investigated. An average of 39 clones from each sample was analysed. The catalytic efficiency of the dominant quasispecies (i.e. the most abundant) from each quasispecies was also assayed for mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) cleavage. Phylogenetic analysis identified two clusters of patients with highly related viruses, suggesting a common source of HCV infection. None of the 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients spontaneously cleared HCV, although 78% of the treated patients achieved a sustained virological response after early treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). The synonymous-nonsynonymous (ds/dn) mutation ratio, a marker of selective pressure, was higher in AHC compared to 26 HIV-1-infected men with genotype 1a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (P < 0.0001). NS3/4A proteases from AHC patients also exhibited higher catalytic efficiency compared to CHC patients (P < 0.0001). No differences were found when ds/dn mutation ratios and NS3/4A protease catalytic efficiencies from AHC HIV-coinfected patients were compared with AHC monoinfected patients. The presence of epidemiological networks of HCV transmission was confirmed among HIV-1-positive MSM. In addition, substantial genetic diversity was demonstrated in AHC. NS3/4A protease efficiency cleaving MAVS may be associated with virus transmission and response to pegIFN/RBV treatment."
9188,0.003,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
1449,0.003,3.0000,"Pulmonary infections are a very common complication in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. These infections may be severe enough to initiate the admission of these patients to intensive care units (ICU). Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent cause of ICU admission because of acute respiratory failure. Mortality of ICU-admitted patients with this infection has changed with time. Initial reports confirmed a high mortality (80% to 90%). After 1985, the mortality rate decreased (50%). Factors such as the use of corticosteroids, better patient care, and a better knowledge of the disease probably explain this change. In recent years (1990 to 1995), mortality has worsened again, perhaps, because ICU facilities were offered more liberally to patients failing aggressive conventional treatment, including adjuvant therapy with corticosteroids. However, for those patients able to be discharged, the prognosis is not worse than expected according to the stage of their human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and immunologic status. Consequently, at least a limited period of ICU care and some respiratory support (either continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation) should be considered and offered to all HIV-1-infected patients with PCP and respiratory failure. Cytomegalovirus may be another cause of severe pulmonary infection in AIDS patients. This infection is difficult to diagnose; hence, it should be suspected when patients with PCP do not progress appropriately, or when no responsible pulmonary pathogen is found. When associated with PCP, mortality is very high. Disseminated tuberculosis is another potential cause of severe respiratory failure and respiratory secretions should be routinely examined for acid-fast bacilli in AIDS patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Finally, bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may also be the etiological agents of severe acute respiratory failure. Empiric antibacterial treatment to cover these microorganisms should be given when a bacterial agent is suspected."
7211,0.003,3.0000,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9451,0.003,3.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) has caused acute and chronic liver diseases in ~350 million infected people worldwide. Halofuginone (HF) is a plant alkaloid which has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in immune regulation. Our present study explored the function of HF in the immune response of HBV-infected Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Plasmid containing pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 was injected in SD rats for the construction of an acute HBV-infected animal model. Our data showed that HF reduced the high concentrations of serum hepatitis B e-antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen, and HBV DNA induced by HBV infection. HF also reduced the number of T helper (Th)17 cells and the expression of interleukin (IL)-17 compared with the pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 group. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-17, IL-23, interferon-γ, and IL-2) were downregulated and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-4 and IL-13) were upregulated by HF. Through further research we found that the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and IKBA which suppressed NF-κB activation was increased while the expression of p-NF-κB P65 was decreased in pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3+HF group compared with pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 group, indicating that HF may work through the activation of AMPK. Finally, our conjecture was further verified by using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, which counteracted the anti-inflammation effect of HF, resulting in the decreased expression of AMPK, IKBA and increased expression of p-NF-κB P65 and reduced number of Th17 cells. In our present study, HF was considered as an anti-inflammatory factor in acute HBV-infected SD rats and worked through AMPK-mediated NF-κB p65 inactivation. This study implicated HF as a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatitis B."
5827,0.003,3.0000,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
7232,0.003,3.0000,"To assess the role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the authors compared survival of tuberculosis patients and controls matched on year of HIV diagnosis and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Patients were selected in the Aquitaine Cohort, which follows, since 1985, all patients infected with HIV, aged more than 13 years, in five hospitals. Time of inclusion of controls was the date of diagnosis of tuberculosis for the corresponding tuberculosis patient. Patients who had received primary prophylaxis against mycobacteria other than tuberculosis were excluded. As of June 30, 1994, 104 tuberculosis patients and 620 controls were selected; they were similar, except for history of intravenous drug use (tuberculosis patients, 51%, vs. controls, 31%) and AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (40 vs. 29%). Survival was shorter in tuberculosis patients than in controls (risk ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1) even after controlling for differences at entry. The risk of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or a decrease to fewer than 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 was slightly but not statistically greater in tuberculosis patients than in controls. Tuberculosis disease affected survival but not occurrence of subsequent opportunistic infections or rate of CD4+ count decline. Tuberculosis may be a marker of advanced HIV and may accelerate its course of infection."
9487,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
7386,0.003,3.0000,"We report a case of simultaneous infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in a 26-year-old Japanese homosexual man. He was admitted to our hospital for acute hepatitis caused by HBV. At that time, HIV-1antibody (Ab) was not detected in his serum. After 6 months, he was readmitted to our hospital for further examination of his liver because of confined liver enzyme abnormalities. Anti-HIV- Ab was detected in his serum by both enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and particle agglutination (PA). His serum HIV-1 RNA level was 50 x 10(4) copies/ml and serum levels of HBV DNA polymerase (DNA-P) and HBV DNA were 6535cpm and 3 plus (>1000 copies/ml). His clinical course and laboratory data suggested progression from acute to chronic hepatitis related to coinfection with HIV-1. The diagnosis was chronic active hepatitis caused by HBV as an opportunistic infection due to coinfection with HIV-1. We began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because interferon (IFN) therapy was ineffective. HAART was started at an initial dosage of 600 mg zidovudine (AZT), 300 mg lamivudine (3TC), and 2400 mg indinavir (IDV) daily. After 4 weeks, the serum level of HBV DNA-polymerase (p) had decreased markedly to 37cpm and that of HIV-1 RNA had decreased to below the sensitivity threshold, indicating considerable suppression of the replication of these viruses by the treatment. But HBV DNA remained at low levels. Although the incidence of HBV infection in patients with HIV-1 infection has been reported to be high in the United States and Europe, simultaneous HBV and HIV-1 infection leading to persistent HBV infection is rare."
8539,0.003,3.0000,"Several new antiviral agents have recently been developed which can inhibit hepatitis B replication by at least two logs. Lamivudine is the most widely studied of these new agents. Extensive phase II and III studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B are in progress, or have been completed. The sustained HBeAg seroconversion rate in patients who have received 100 mg lamivudine rate increase from 17% at year one to 27% after 2 years. Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis. Both HBeAg and anti-HBe positive patients are benefited, as may be patients with cirrhosis."
9053,0.003,3.0000,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented. We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ≥9.5 kPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."
7929,0.003,3.0000,"Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is relatively common. However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."
3303,0.003,3.0000,"The relevance of zinc in resistance to infections by virus, fungi and bacteria is recognized because of its pivotal role in the efficiency of the entire immune system, in particular in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called thymulin, which has differentiation properties on T-cell lines. In infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the zinc-bound form of thymulin (active thymulin, ZnFTS) is strongly reduced in stage IV of the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) with concomitant decrements in CD4(+) cell count and zincemia values. The zinc-unbound form of thymulin (inactive thymulin, FTS) is, in contrast, very high. The in vitro addition of zinc to plasma samples induces a recovery of the thymulin active form, suggesting low zinc bioavailability as the cause of impaired thymic functions with consequent CD4(+) depletion. An analysis of risk factors for the incidence of recidivism opportunistic infections shows CD4(+) depletion and zinc deficiency to have significant scores. Supplementation with zinc for 1 mo (45 mg Zn(2+)/d) associated with zidovudine (AZT) therapy in stage IV induces recovery of active zinc-bound thymulin, of zincemia, of CD4(+) cells with concomitant reduction (50%) of recidivism opportunistic infections compared with the AZT-treated group. Complete disappearance of recidivism by Candida aesophagea or Pneumocystis carinii is observed after supplementation with zinc. The relative risk factors (CD4(+) depletion and zinc-deficiency) have lower scores in the HIV-positive zinc-treated group, confirming, as such, the relevance of zinc in opportunistic infections that involve extracellular matrix. Such an assumption is indirectly confirmed with new HAART, where no opportunistic infections occur. Indeed, HIV RNA is inversely correlated with both CD4(+) and zincemia values (r = -0.73, P<0.01) in HAART-treated subjects. Lower scores for the same relative factors for the appearance of opportunistic infections are present in HAART-treated subjects compared with those treated with AZT. These findings, on the one hand, show the poor efficacy of AZT therapy compared with HAART therapy for the progression of HIV, but on the other hand, they suggest that the lack of occurrence of opportunistic infections by HAART may also result from major zinc bioavailability. This further supports the key role played by zinc against opportunistic infections in HIV with a possible independent effect by either HIV or the pathogens involved."
4572,0.003,3.0000,"The prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected persons has not been well characterized in the HAART era. In a single-center, retrospective study, anemia prevalence and risk factors, including use of HAART, were assessed in an ambulatory clinical cohort of 758 HIV-infected patients for the calendar year 2000. The relationships between anemia (hemoglobin level less than 12.5 g/dL) and demographic variables, antiretroviral treatment regimens, and disease markers were analyzed. Mean baseline patient characteristics were hemoglobin level, 13.7 +/- 1.9 g/dL; CD4+ cell count, 405 +/- 293/microL; and HIV RNA level, 77,841 +/- 148,394 copies/mL. Overall anemia prevalence was 30.3%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that anemia was associated with a CD4+ cell count below 50/microL, female sex, black race, a viral load above 100,000 copies/mL, zidovudine use, and older age. Severe anemia was less prevalent in this study population than in historical comparators; however, mild to moderate anemia rates remain high."
8094,0.003,3.0000,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."

A total of 389 whites and 135 nonwhites started receiving HAART before 1 April 2001. After 1 year of treatment, 78% of nonwhites and 76% of whites achieved a virus load of <500 HIV RNA copies/mL. No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count. One year after fulfilling Danish recommendations for initiation of HAART, 91% of nonwhites and 93% of whites had started receiving HAART.

1190,0.003,3.0000,"Physical activity (PA) can improve cardiorespiratory status, strength, body composition and quality of life for patients infected with HIV. Evidence from HIV-uninfected populations also shows that PA is associated with a lower risk of mortality, primarily death due to cardiovascular causes. There is, however, a lack of data on how physically active HIV-infected patients are. In this study, we assessed levels of self-reported PA over time in patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a large multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We included a total of 10,540 patients who completed at least one report of PA between December 2009 and November 2014 during routine clinical follow-up (scheduled every 6 months). In the first year after December 2009 there was a higher rate of non-response so these data are of a lesser reliability. Over the next four years, the percentage of patients reporting no free-time PA at all declined from 49% to 44%. In contrast, in two ""Sport Switzerland"" surveys of the general population in 2008 and 2014, the percentage of individuals reporting no sports activities at all was considerably lower and relatively stable over time (27% in 2008; 26% in 2014). In our analysis, the percentage of patients reporting sedentary activity at work increased from 23% to 26% over the four years. Subgroup findings suggest differences between women and men and between patients classified by their age, stage of infection and CD4 cell count. Integrating PA counselling into the routine care of HIV-infected patients and promoting PA among this population has the potential to improve the general state of health and quality of life for HIV-infected patients and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease."
5770,0.003,3.0000,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
995,0.003,3.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 fusion inhibitor T-20 (Enfuvirtide, Fuzeon) has recently been introduced into clinical practice. T-20 in combination with HAART efficiently inhibits HIV-1 replication, however T-20 resistance has been reported and the number of confirmed resistant-associated mutations is growing. In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."
5091,0.003,3.0000,"HLA-B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression, although risk of progression may vary among patients carrying this allele. The interplay between HIV-1 evolutionary rate variation and risk of progression to AIDS in HLA-B*5701 subjects was studied using longitudinal viral sequences from high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressors (LRPs). Posterior distributions of HIV-1 genealogies assuming a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock were used to estimate the absolute rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions for different set of branches. Rates of viral evolution, as well as in vitro viral replication capacity assessed using a novel phenotypic assay, were correlated with various clinical parameters. HIV-1 synonymous substitution rates were significantly lower in LRPs than HRPs, especially for sets of internal branches. The viral population infecting LRPs was also characterized by a slower increase in synonymous divergence over time. This pattern did not correlate to differences in viral fitness, as measured by in vitro replication capacity, nor could be explained by differences among subjects in T cell activation or selection pressure. Interestingly, a significant inverse correlation was found between baseline CD4+ T cell counts and mean HIV-1 synonymous rate (which is proportional to the viral replication rate) along branches representing viral lineages successfully propagating through time up to the last sampled time point. The observed lower replication rate in HLA-B*5701 subjects with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts provides a potential model to explain differences in risk of disease progression among individuals carrying this allele.

2380,0.003,3.0000,"HIV-associated hematological abnormalities involve all lineages of blood cells, thus implying that the virus impairs the function of early HSCs. However, the underlying mechanisms of this defect are unknown, particularly since HSCs are largely resistant to HIV-1 infection. In this issue of the JCI, Prost and colleagues show that the viral accessory protein Negative factor (Nef) plays a potentially critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV-associated hematopoietic dysfunction by affecting the clonogenic potential of HSCs (see the related article beginning on page 1765). Soluble Nef induces PPARgamma in uninfected HSCs, thereby suppressing the expression of STAT5A and STAT5B, two factors necessary for proper HSC function. The identification of this novel activity of extracellular Nef defines a new mechanism of HIV/SIV pathogenesis and suggests that approaches aimed at increasing STAT5A and STAT5B expression may be considered in HIV-infected individuals with prominent hematological abnormalities. The results also raise the question of whether dysregulation of hematopoiesis by extracellular Nef plays a role in the development of T cell immunodeficiency and the high levels of chronic immune activation associated with AIDS."

Hematologic toxicities necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation are limiting factors to HCV treatment in the coinfected patient. This study aimed to identify predictors for the need of filgrastim and darbepoetin to manage hematologic toxicities so as to maintain patients on full doses of study drugs for the duration of study. The primary study was a single-center, open-label, prospective study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and viral kinetics of 48-week peginterferon alfa 2b and ribavirin in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Complete blood count was monitored at baseline, days 3, 7, 10, 14, and then weekly for the first month, fortnightly until week 8, then monthly from week 12 to 48. Filgrastim was initiated when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) fell below 750 cells/mm(3) and darbepoetin was used when hemoglobin dropped to less than 10 g/dL. All patients experienced decrease in ANC and hemoglobin. Twenty of 30 (66.6%) of patients required hematopoeitic growth factors, 15 (50%) received filgrastim, and 12 (40%) received darbepoetin. Seven (23.3%) required both. Baseline ANC of less than 2250 cells per millimeter and negative rate of change of hemoglobin on day 3 of therapy were excellent predictors for filgrastim and darbepoetin use, respectively. Supplemental growth factors were associated with substantial increase in overall cost for HCV treatment. Larger clinical trials will be needed to address the cost effectiveness of supplemental growth factor use in the HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
5442,0.003,3.0000,"To determine the effect of active tuberculosis on survival and the incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study at four U.S. medical centers to compare the survival and incidence rate of opportunistic infections in 106 HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (cases) with that of 106 HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis (control subjects) but with a similar level of immunosuppression (measured by the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count) as the cases. Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."
7533,0.003,3.0000,"HIV-positive individuals who use injection drugs (IDU) may have lower rates of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ≥95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."
1083,0.003,3.0000,"Although therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus infection has delivered remarkable cure rates, curative therapies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) may only be available in the distant future. The possibility to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response has stimulated the development of specific immunotherapies for HBV infection. We reviewed the development of T-cell therapy for HBV, highlighting its potential antiviral efficiency but also its potential toxicities in different groups of chronic HBV patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are the only two communicable diseases in which there have been increases in related morbidity and mortality over the past 20 years [1]. Both viruses are chronically infecting about 500 million people (HBV ~350 million, HCV ~150 million) and represent the seventh most frequent cause of death worldwide [1]. HBV and HCV are hepatotropic, non-cytopathic viruses able to establish persistent infections that cause different degrees of hepatic inflammation (chronic hepatitis), leading to the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The two viruses are unrelated and virologically different. HCV remains prevalent in North America and Europe, whereas chronic hepatitis B is prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [1,2]. HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family, and HBV is a DNA virus of the Hepadnaviridae family and uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize its DNA from a pre-genomic RNA form [3]. HCV is able to activate in the infected host a classical type I interferon (IFN)-mediated innate response [3], whereas HBV generally escapes innate immune recognition and does not activate type I IFN-mediated immunity. Chronic HBV and HCV infections are both characterized by quantitative and functional defects of virus-specific T-cell response [4,5]. The frequency of virus-specific T cells is extremely low, and virus-specific T cells show features of exhaustion in both chronic HBV and HCV patients [6]. However, the quantitative and functional defects are more pronounced in HBV infections, with T cells virtually undetectable in the blood of many chronic HBV patients by ex vivo analysis [7-9]. In addition, while frequency and impact of viral mutations in T cell epitopes are frequently detectable in HCV infections [10], viral mutations affecting CD8 T-cell epitopes are scarcer in chronic HBV patients [6,11,12]. Of extreme practical importance in relation to the potential impact of T-cell therapy for HBV and HCV are the efficacies of currently available treatments. New therapies for HCV have delivered remarkable cure rates, with more than 90% of patients achieving viral clearance with all oral direct-acting antivirals [13]. In contrast, curative therapies for HBV will not be available until the distant future (14). Thus, although it is difficult to see a possible therapeutic advantage of a new T-cell-based therapy in chronic HCV patients, the fact that current therapies for HBV only partially suppress but do not eliminate HBV from the infected host has encouraged research for new and more radical therapies designed to eliminate or at least stably maintain low levels of HBV replication under the control of a functional anti-host response. For these reasons, in this review, we concentrate on the development of T-cell therapy for HBV. T-cell therapy for HCV chronic infection is certainly important for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell antiviral control [15,16], but their use for therapy appears unlikely."
7036,0.003,3.0000,"Since the first tests for antibodies to components of the hepatitis C virus became widely available there has been considerable interest in evidence linking HCV infection with autoimmune liver diseases and other autoimmune conditions. With respect to autoimmune hepatitis, it is now clear that the early tests were quite non-specific and that it was the abnormalities in serum globulins in autoimmune hepatitis which led to such high positivity rates in this disease. Careful surveys across Europe have now made it clear that there are true associations between HCV infection and autoimmune liver diseases, but that their frequency is much higher in the south than the north. This is particularly striking for that variety of autoimmune hepatitis positive for antibodies to the liver/kidney microsomal antigen (cytochrome P450 2D6). Here there are distinct subgroups; one a ""true"" autoimmune group of younger females with more active disease, and a second, containing older patients with a more even sex distribution, where the virus seems to be driving an autoimmune reaction. The mechanisms underlying these associations are not yet clear, although analysis of the amino-acid sequences of selected virus and host proteins has shown some significant homology. Interestingly, and surprisingly, the overall incidence of periportal hepatitis is lower in HCV infection than in acute or chronic HBV infection, or acute HAV hepatitis. There is a parallel distribution in the frequency and titre of antibodies to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, one of the important targets for autoimmune reactions on the liver cell membrane. There are many reports of associations between HCV infection and other immune-mediated conditions, and although the strength of such associations is always difficult to judge, HCV infection in some conditions, such as cryglobulinaemia, is clearly an important driving force. Here, treatment of the HCV infection with interferon may led to striking remission in associated vascular lesions. Clinically, it can be very difficult to distinguish between liver disease due to HCV infection and autoimmune hepatitis co-existing with HCV infection, but because the treatment for these two conditions is quite different, the distinction is important. Alpha-interferon, the current treatment of choice for HCV infection, often induces a relapse in autoimmune hepatitis, while steroids, the treatment of choice for autoimmune hepatitis, may be permissive for HCV replication, and thus, at least in theory, may militate against the success of a subsequent course of alpha-interferon. A pragmatic approach to the choice of a first therapeutic agent is recommended based on the relative local prevalence of the two conditions, the use of readily available clinical tests, and the results of appropriate specialised assays in the most difficult cases."
9389,0.003,3.0000,"From 1 January 1995 through 31 June 1997, 153 cases of coccidioidomycosis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons were identified in Arizona (incidence, 41/1000 persons living with AIDS). A case-control study was conducted to evaluate risk factors for coccidioidomycosis in HIV-infected persons. A case was defined as laboratory-confirmed, incident coccidioidomycosis in a person infected with HIV for > or =3 months, and each case patient had 3 control patients matched by county, age group, sex, HIV/AIDS status, and CD4 lymphocyte count. Multivariable analysis identified black race and a history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis to be associated with increased risk of coccidioidomycosis; protease inhibitor therapy was associated with a reduced risk. In persons with previous history of oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, having received an azole drug was associated with a reduced risk (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9; P=.04). Physicians may need to consider azole chemoprophylaxis for HIV-infected persons who live in areas of endemicity, have CD4 cell counts <200/microL, are black, or have a history of thrush."
6034,0.003,3.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to persistent virus infections. Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."
801,0.003,3.0000,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."
7054,0.003,3.0000,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
8118,0.003,3.0000,"Invasive pneumococcal disease (PD) occurs frequently among HIV-infected patients, but it is unclear whether its manifestations and outcome are different compared to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. Because the immune reconstitution that accompanies antiretroviral therapy may change some of these features and because most cases of HIV- 1 infection occur in resource-poor settings of the world where access to antiretroviral agents is limited, we compared PD among patients with and without HIV-1 infection in a North American population before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The records of all pneumococcal cultures processed at this medical center over a period of 20 months were used to identify patients with invasive PD. Hospital records were reviewed for 103 of these patients (52 with and 51 without HIV-1 infection) and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and microbiologic information was abstracted and subsequently analyzed. Despite similarities in presenting signs and symptoms, we found a higher incidence of bacteremia but a more favorable outcome with less frequent requirements for intubation and admission to intensive care units and better survival among individuals with HIV infection. Factors such as less advanced age, the presence of fewer comorbid conditions, or a less florid inflammatory response among HIV-infected individuals may account for differences in outcome of invasive PD."
2193,0.003,3.0000,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."
8266,0.003,3.0000,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
2533,0.003,3.0000,"R7V is a seven-aminoacid peptide epitope derived from cellular beta-2 microglobulin, present on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion surface in patients with HIV infection. Antibodies against R7V peptide have the property of neutralizing all strains of HIV, unrelated to genotype, phenotype, or geographical origin of the virus, even in the presence of anti-retroviral drug resistance. Patients that mount an anti-R7V antibody response have been shown to be slow or non-progressors and this epitope has been considered for vaccine and/or therapeutic uses. In this study, HIV-infected patients under highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, were evaluated for the presence of anti-R7V antibodies. Thirty-three HIV positive patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled to the study. For HIV-infected patients, determination of viral load and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were performed by a commercial real-time PCR assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Anti-R7V antibodies were detected from serum samples by a commercial ELISA (Anti-R7V ELISA, Ivagen, France) test. Three HIV infected patients (3/33, 9.1%) displayed anti-R7V antibodies whereas the remaining 30 (90.9%) patients and all controls were interpreted as negative. No statistically significant difference was detected for HIV-RNA levels and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts between anti-R7V positive and negative patients (p= 0.871 and p= 0.287, respectively). These results indicate the presence of anti-R7V antibodies in our study population with HIV infection. No correlation with the presence of anti-R7V and disease progression were displayed in this study. Clinical impact of anti-R7V antibody assays for the management of HIV-infected patients will be revealed in the near future with the help of advanced studies."
4712,0.003,3.0000,"A number of factors, including increased iron stores and alcohol consumption, are known to be associated with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in susceptible individuals. Recent reports have described a significant association between inheritance of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, associated with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and PCT. A strong association between hepatitis C virus infection and PCT has also been demonstrated, while case reports record a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and PCT. We have investigated the frequency of these factors in a racially-mixed population of patients with PCT in Cape Town, South Africa. 57 patients with PCT drawn from three ethnic groups were screened for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations linked to GH, and the prevalences were compared with corresponding healthy control populations. The seroprevalence of markers for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV infection were examined in 28 of these. In the control populations, we found that both the C282Y and H63D mutations are highly prevalent in South Africans of European origin. In a population of mixed or Asian origin, the C282Y mutation is very rare whereas the H63D mutation is common. Neither mutation was encountered in any African subject. Both mutations are associated with PCT, but the association is dependent on the ethnic origins of the population to which the patient belongs. In contrast to other studies, HCV infection is numerically unimportant in PCT in our patients. HIV infection is increasingly encountered in our patients with PCT, but the strength of the association cannot be determined in view of the high background prevalence of HIV infection in some sectors of the South African population. The contribution of specific risk factors may be heavily dependent on the population from which patients are drawn, and care should be taken in extrapolating from observations in one racial or geographic population to any other."
8461,0.003,3.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is widespread and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality due to the evolution to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."
1557,0.003,3.0000,"Although most hepatitis B virus (HBV) related chronic liver diseases manifest themselves in adulthood, HBV infection usually begins in infancy or early childhood in hyperendemic areas. The following factors affect the natural course of HBV: 1) host factors: a) initial age of infection: the younger the patient at infection, the more chance the disease will run a chronic course. Immune tolerance to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and core antigen persists for a period of time in young children. b) the immune status of the host: the usage and tapering of immunosuppressants may induce a severe course with a fatal outcome; 2) maternal carrier status: children of HBeAg seropositive mothers are more immune tolerant to HBV, and thus have lower rates of HBeAg and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion; and 3) viral factors: mutations of the HBV precore, core or core promoter genes are related to fulminant hepatitis B or severe chronic hepatitis B. However, this is a matter of contention. Since July 1984, a nationwide HBV vaccination program has been successfully conducted in Taiwan. In 1994, the HBsAg carrier rate in Taipei city was reduced to < 1% in children younger than 10 years of age. Continuous efforts in immunoprophylaxis will hopefully further reduce the incidence of hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the next generation."
1691,0.003,3.0000,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
2597,0.003,3.0000,"Background Advances in the treatment of HIV infection have enabled better control of the disease, allowing patients to enjoy a longer life expectancy. However, the ageing of patients leads to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Various studies have found that pharmaceutical care results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To measure the impact of pharmaceutical care on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Setting Outpatient pharmacy service of a tertiary hospital, Spain. Methods A pre/post-intervention quasi-experimental clinical study was conducted in which health education and pharmacist interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors were carried out in a single patient cohort using the Dader method of pharmacotherapy, with a 12-month follow-up period per patient. Patients included were older than 50 years, with moderate/elevated cardiovascular risk. Data were obtained from patient clinical histories, dispensing records and patient interviews, and were subjected to statistical analysis. Main outcome measure Cardiovascular risk estimated by SCORE and REGICOR equations. Results Forty-two patients completed the study. Of these, 93 % were men, with an average age of 57 years and 15 years since diagnosis of HIV. A reduction was observed in the mean values (baseline vs. 12 months) of the following cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure (P = 0.009), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010), total cholesterol (P = 0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; P = 0.039), triglycerides (P = 0.010) and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c; P < 0.001). An increase in HDL-c (P = 0.037) was also observed. The average cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE instrument was reduced from 7.6 % at the beginning of the study to 6.4 % after 12 months (P = 0.039). The risk estimate according to REGICOR also decreased (P = 0.002). Over the 12-month period, 6.3 ± 3.4 interventions were carried out per patient. Quantitative ineffectiveness was the most prevalent negative outcome associated with medication throughout the study, and noncompliance was the most frequent cause. Interventions on health education were the most common, followed by interventions on improving adherence. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care, delivered as a combination of health education and pharmacotherapy follow-up to outpatients at a tertiary hospital, had a positive impact on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy."

Results obtained with other HIV-1 markers for this purpose are often inconsistent. This study examined the relationship between various HIV-1 markers by using clinical specimens (plasma) from HIV-1-infected individuals at different stages of disease progression and supernatant fluid from four human T-lymphocyte cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1. Cell culture specimens were collected periodically over 7 days and were tested for HIV-1 RNA levels with a nucleic acid amplification assay, for p24 with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and for reverse transcriptase activity by isotope uptake. An increase in the level of each marker was observed over the 7-day period with each of the four HIV-1 strains tested (LAV1, HTLV-IIIB, MN, and ARV2); with these specimens, the frequency of detection for each marker was 100%. In the clinical specimens, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (143 of 183 specimens [78%]) than was p24 (87 of 183 [48%]); little correlation between the levels of the two markers was seen. In these clinical specimens evaluated, CD4(+)-cell counts were better correlated with the frequency and levels of HIV-1 RNA than with p24. In specimens (n = 38) collected serially from six HIV-1-infected subjects, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (33 of 38 [85%]) than p24 (23 of 38 [59%]). When reported by the assays used, the levels of both HIV-1 markers fluctuated over time for each of the subjects. Although the markers correlated in the in vitro systems studied, the observed differences in the correlation of levels and frequencies of HIV-1 markers in vivo indicate that p24 has less clinical utility than does viral load testing when used in conjunction with CD4(+)-cell counts as a measure of immune system functioning."
7450,0.003,3.0000,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
1283,0.003,3.0000,"AIDS is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U.S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95% with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40% of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV became part of the definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10%, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in less than or equal to 1 of every 10(4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5% of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive ""AIDS test."" (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90% Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U.S. but over 90% slim disease, fever, and diarrhea in Africa.(viii) It is highly improbable that within the last few years two viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) that are only 40% sequence-related would have evolved that could both cause the newly defined syndrome AIDS. Also, viruses are improbable that kill their only natural host with efficiencies of 50-100%, as is claimed for HIVs. It is concluded that HIV is not sufficient for AIDS and that it may not even be necessary for AIDS because its activity is just as low in symptomatic carriers as in asymptomatic carriers. The correlation between antibody to HIV and AIDS does not prove causation, because otherwise indistinguishable diseases are now set apart only on the basis of this antibody. I propose that AIDS is not a contagious syndrome caused by one conventional virus or microbe. No such virus or microbe would require almost a decade to cause primary disease, nor could it cause the diverse collection of AIDS diseases. Neither would its host range be as selective as that of AIDS, nor could it survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS. Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conventional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional pathogens, including acute viral or microbial infections and chronic drug use and malnutrition. The long and unpredictable intervals between infection with HIV and AIDS would then reflect the thresholds for these pathogenic factors to cause AIDS diseases, instead of an unlikely mechanism of HIV pathogenesis."
8643,0.003,3.0000,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
8738,0.003,3.0000,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of infections with hepatotrophic viruses in an anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive population from Buenos Aires and to compare it among the main risk groups for HIV infection. Four hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients attending the HIV outpatients clinic were studied: 359 men and 125 women, median age 29 years (range 16-67 years); 35.5% had presented acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions. Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."
3936,0.003,3.0000,"Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is common in Egypt and other developing countries. Patients coinfected with HCV and schistosomiasis exhibit a unique clinical, virological and histological pattern manifested by viral persistence with high HCV RNA titers as well as higher necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores in their liver biopsy samples. Dual infections of schistosomiasis and viral infections display significant influences on host immune reactions including cytokine shift pattern alteration, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and other impaired immunologic functions with diminished capacity to clear the virus. We investigated the cytokine pattern against HCV and S. mansoni antigens in patients coinfected with HCV and S. mansoni and compared them with responses in patients infected with HCV or S. mansoni alone. This study included 4 groups; (Gr I) included 20 patients infected with chronic HCV, their sera were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, samples were verified for RNA detection to identify those who have viremia. (Gr II) included 15 patients infected with schistosomiasis alone, they were subjected to detection of S. mansoni ova in stool, rectal snip or serological test. (Gr III) included 20 patients with chronic HCV and schistosomiasis coinfection, which were diagnosed by the above-mentioned criteria. (Gr IV) included 15 healthy individuals, who were matched for age and sex and have no evidence of liver diseases served as control subjects. The results showed that a highly significant increase in serum IFN-gamma and IL-18 levels in patients infected with HCV alone compared with the other patient groups and control. On the other hand, a highly significant increase was found in serum IL-4 and IL-10 levels in coinfected patients and patients with schistosomiasis alone compared with the control but a significant increase was found in the two groups compared with HCV patients. A significant increase in serum IL-4 and IL-10 were also found in HCV patients compared with the control. In conclusions, our data showed that coinfected patients have dominant Th2 cytokine profile induced by S. mansoni and this Th2 antagonized and down-regulated the antiviral activities of Th1 cytokine profile in HCV infection that probably acquired after S. mansoni infection resulting in failing to mount significant HCV specific Th1 response and thereby fail to clear the virus in coinfected, compared with patients infected with HCV or schistosomiasis alone."
8762,0.003,3.0000,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."
5703,0.003,3.0000,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
3009,0.003,3.0000,"Viral replication of HIV-1 in the human body is a dynamic process. Incomplete suppression of replication during antiretroviral therapy ultimately selects for resistance that imparts an adaptive advantage to HIV-1. Therefore, the goal of antiretroviral therapy is complete suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression to below the lowest possible limits of detection has been associated with an optimal clinical response and delay of drug resistance. An ultrasensitive viral load assay with a very low threshold of detection remains our best laboratory tool to monitor the response to therapy. Patients may fail HAART for many reasons. Only when other potential causes of treatment failure are excluded should antiretroviral resistance testing be considered. Genotypic and phenotypic assays for assessing resistance are now available, and recent retrospective and prospective data support their use in clinical management as an adjunct to helping to choose among different antiretroviral drugs. Despite the growing enthusiasm for these tests, improvements in sensitivity, turnaround time, and quality control are still needed. A practitioner's decision about when to initiate or change therapy in an HIV-infected patient should depend primarily on viral load results, and not on antiretroviral resistance test results. Moreover, resistance testing is no substitute for a thorough clinical and drug history. As we approach the third decade of the HIV epidemic, we will learn how to use antiretroviral resistance tests in conjunction with (not in lieu of) proven clinical and laboratory tools."
4758,0.003,3.0000,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
8868,0.003,3.0000,"The World Health Organization developed a set of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance (HIVDR) early warning indicators (EWIs) to assess antiretroviral therapy clinic and program factors associated with HIVDR. EWIs are monitored by abstracting data routinely recorded in clinical records, and the results enable clinics and program managers to identify problems that should be addressed to minimize preventable emergence of HIVDR in clinic populations. As of June 2011, 50 countries monitored EWIs, covering 131 686 patients initiating antiretroviral treatment between 2004 and 2009 at 2107 clinics. HIVDR prevention is associated with patient care (appropriate prescribing and patient monitoring), patient behavior (adherence), and clinic/program management efforts to reduce treatment interruptions (follow up, retention on first-line ART, procurement and supply management of antiretroviral drugs). EWIs measure these factors and the results have been used to optimize patient and population treatment outcomes."
1794,0.003,3.0000,"The burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related disease in sub-Saharan Africa continues to increase; providing adequate care for the huge number of people affected is a daunting task, especially given the limited resources available. Recent studies have shown that low-cost regimens can prevent some of the most important causes of HIV-related disease in African countries. Isoniazid preventive therapy can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis; priorities are to seek opportunities for implementation, to assess effectiveness under operational conditions, and to monitor its effect on resistance patterns. Cotrimoxazole was shown to be highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among individuals with symptomatic HIV disease in Côte d'Ivoire, and should be implemented where it is likely to be of benefit. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was disappointingly ineffective among HIV-infected Ugandan adults, but newer conjugate vaccines are becoming available that should be investigated. The benefit of these preventive regimens to the individual may be modest when compared with the effect of antiretroviral therapy. However, simple preventive therapies could reach a much wider population than is immediately feasible for expensive and complex antiretroviral regimens, and thus have the potential for substantial benefit at the population level. The availability of effective and affordable regimens to prevent HIV-related disease may also encourage people to seek HIV testing, combat denial, and help overcome the sense of powerlessness in countries where the HIV epidemic has hit hardest."
4530,0.003,3.0000,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."
4173,0.003,3.0000,"HIV-1 group O infections remains essentially restricted to central Africa, and particularly Cameroon, although isolated cases have been reported in Western countries. Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."
4403,0.003,3.0000,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
7071,0.003,3.0000,"Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite concern over EFV tolerability in clinical trials and practice, particularly related to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, some observational studies have shown high rates of EFV continuation at one year and low rates of CNS-related EFV substitution. The objective of this study was to further examine the real-world rate of CNS-related EFV discontinuation in antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-1 patients. This retrospective cohort study used a nationally representative electronic medical records database to identify HIV-1 patients ≥12 years old, treated with a 1st-line EFV-based regimen (single or combination antiretroviral tablet) from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2013. Patients without prior record of EFV use during 6-month baseline (i.e., antiretroviral therapy naïve) were followed 12 months post-medication initiation. CNS-related EFV discontinuation was defined as evidence of a switch to a replacement antiretroviral coupled with record of a CNS symptom within 30 days prior, absent lab evidence of virologic failure. We identified 1742 1st-line EFV patients. Mean age was 48 years, 22.7% were female, and 8.1% had a prior report of CNS symptoms. The first year, overall discontinuation rate among new users of EFV was 16.2%. Ten percent of patients (n = 174) reported a CNS symptom and 1.1% (n = 19) discontinued EFV due to CNS symptoms: insomnia (n = 12), headache (n = 5), impaired concentration (n = 1), and somnolence (n = 1). The frequency of CNS symptoms was similar for patients who discontinued EFV compared to those who did not (10.3 vs. 9.9%; P = .86). Our study found that EFV discontinuation due to CNS symptoms was low, consistent with prior reports."
6426,0.003,3.0000,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
3886,0.003,3.0000,"Low-level viremia due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was demonstrated in the sera of two patients diagnosed previously as having non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis. Both patients had a ""silent"" HBV infection, because they were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody. The TaqMan chemistry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the HBV DNA, enabling quantitation of the virus in their sera. Their serum HBV DNA concentrations were low: the amount of each HBV S or X gene amplified showed there were approximately 10(3) copies/ml and HBV DNA was detected occasionally during clinical follow-up. Positive HBsAg staining in liver tissues was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. Vertical transmission of silent HBV from one patient to her daughter was confirmed. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified HBV X region revealed several mutations, suggesting reduced viral replication. One patient had a T-to-C mutation at the extreme 5'-terminus of the direct repeat 2 region and the other exhibited a coexisting X region with a 155-nucleotide deletion. These findings suggest that HBV replication is suppressed considerably in patients with silent hepatitis B."
3465,0.003,3.0000,"Certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with improved clinical outcomes for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms for their effects remain undefined. An early CD8(+) T-cell escape mutation in the dominant HLA-B57-restricted Gag epitope TW10 (TSTLQEQIGW) has been shown to impair HIV-1 replication capacity in vitro. We demonstrate here that this T(242)N substitution in the capsid protein is associated with upstream mutations at residues H(219), I(223), and M(228) in the cyclophilin A (CypA)-binding loop in B57(+) individuals with progressive disease. In an independent cohort of epidemiologically linked transmission pairs, the presence of these substitutions in viruses encoding T(242)N was associated with significantly higher plasma viremia in donors, further suggesting that these secondary mutations compensated for the replication defect of T(242)N. Using NL4-3 constructs, we illustrate the ability of these CypA loop changes to partially restore replication of the T(242)N variant in vitro. Notably, these mutations also enhanced viral resistance to the drug cyclosporine A, indicating a reduced dependence of the compensated virus on CypA that is normally essential for optimal infectivity. Therefore, mutations in TW10 allow HIV-1 to evade a dominant early CD8(+) T-cell response, but the benefits of escape are offset by a defect in capsid function. These data suggest that TW10 escape variants undergo a postentry block that is partially overcome by changes in the CypA-binding loop and identify a mechanism for an HIV-1 fitness defect that may contribute to the slower disease progression associated with HLA-B57."
9575,0.003,3.0000,"Recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Recently, antiviral therapy, such as lamivudine, has become available for prophylaxis against HBV reactivation posttransplantation and for the treatment of HBV recurrent disease. We report our initial experience with lamivudine therapy in patients with precore mutant-associated HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation (n = 29). Outcomes were compared in three patient groups: group 1, precore mutant HBV infection not receiving lamivudine (n = 10); group 2, recurrent precore mutant HBV infection posttransplantation subsequently treated with lamivudine (n = 10); and group 3, HBV precore mutant patients undergoing liver transplantation and receiving lamivudine and low-dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) from the time of transplantation (n = 9). In group 1, HBV recurred in 9 of 10 patients, with subsequent graft loss in all 9 patients. In group 2, all patients developed HBV recurrence at a mean of 7.3 months posttransplantation and started lamivudine therapy at a median of 16 months posttransplantation. Follow-up on lamivudine therapy was for a median of 11 months. Six of these 10 patients developed mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with lamivudine resistance. There were two liver failure-related deaths in this group. In group 3 patients, there was one death from graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 8 patients have been followed up for a mean of 15.6 months posttransplantation, and all remain hepatitis B surface antigen negative and HBV DNA negative. In conclusion, lamivudine therapy in association with low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing HBV reactivation posttransplantation. Rescue therapy with lamivudine in patients with HBV recurrence is only moderately effective, with a 60% lamivudine resistance rate in patients treated for longer than 6 months."
9951,0.003,3.0000,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
1677,0.003,3.0000,"This seroprevalence report examines serologic evidence of hepatitis B immunization or infection and associated demographic/behavioral factors in adolescent (aged 12-20) subjects enrolled in a nontherapeutic clinical trial at 43 Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) clinical centers. Subjects (n = 94) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through sexual activity were categorized as hepatitis B virus (HBV)-immunized, HBV-infected, or nonimmune by hepatitis B serology performed on specimens collected within the subject's first 48 weeks on study (1993-1995). Sixteen percent of the 94 serologically classified subjects were immunized; 19% HBV-infected; 65% nonimmune. Of the three risk factor scores examined (sociodemographic, sexual, and substance abuse), substance use alone demonstrated a significant difference among groups (despite virtually no reported injecting drug behavior), with the sexual risk score exhibiting marginally significant differences. Logistic regression analysis (restricted to nonimmunized subjects) showed that male-male sexual activity raised the odds of HBV infection by a factor of 5.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-18. 23) relative to heterosexual activity; and that for every one point increase on the substance abuse risk scale the odds of infection increased 5% (95% CI: 0.99-1.10). The HBV infection rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive females is twice United States population-based rates; the rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive males is nearly seven times higher. Past immunization efforts in this population appear to have been based on sexual activity volume without regard to injecting-drug use in sex partners."
9201,0.003,3.0000,"Mutations in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) core gene may influence disease activity by altering immune recognition sites or level of virus replication. Sera from 69 Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplification of HBV DNA to determine the frequency and location of naturally occurring HBV core gene mutations. All but one patient had nucleotide changes, and 44 (64%) patients had at least one amino acid change (mean, 3.7; range, 1-13) when compared with published sequences. Multiple regression analysis showed that the frequency of core gene mutations was significantly associated with precore stop-codon mutation, hepatitis B e antigen negativity, and active liver disease, but not patients' age. The mean number of amino acid changes/patient for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with elevated versus normal aminotransferase levels were, respectively, 2.8 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.2. The corresponding values for HBeAg-negative patients were, respectively, 5.0 +/- 1.2 and 6.0 +/- 1.5. Thirteen patients were serially studied, the mean rates of amino acid substitution in HBeAg-positive patients who did or did not clear HBeAg during follow-up were 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 0 per codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the codon/yr. Most of the mutations were clustered in the middle of the core gene that harbor several major B- and helper T-cell epitopes. Very few mutations were found in the C-terminal part of the core gene. In summary, mutations in the core gene can be frequently detected in patients with chronic HBV infection. These mutations occur predominantly around the time of HBeAg clearance when liver disease is most active."
6979,0.003,3.0000,"Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have revolutionized the modern treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV). These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."
6566,0.003,3.0000,"Nevirapine, a component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, known for auto-induction of metabolism, is initiated at half therapeutic dose until day 14 ('lead-in period'), and subsequently escalated to full dose. However, studies have shown that this dosing strategy based on adult studies may not be appropriate in children, given that younger children have higher drug clearance rates. In this prospective cohort study, we studied trough plasma nevirapine levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at days 7, 14 (lead-in period) and 28 (full dose period) after ART initiation amongst HIV-1 infected children initiating nevirapine-based ART in southern India. Among the 20 children (50% male, median age 9 years) included in the study, sub-therapeutic trough plasma nevirapine concentration (<4μg/ml) was seen in 65% (13/20) of children during the lead-in period within two weeks of ART initiation and among 10% of children at 4 weeks during full-dose nevirapine. Adherence was documented as ≥95% in all children by both caregiver self-report and pill count. Median nevirapine concentrations achieved at week 1 was 4.8 μg/ml, significantly lower than 8 μg/ml, the concentration achieved at week 4 (p = 0.034). Virological failure at one year of ART was observed in six children, and was not associated with median nevirapine concentration achieved during week 1, 2 or 4. We conclude that the dose escalation strategy currently practiced among young children living with HIV-1 resulted in significant subtherapeutic nevirapine concentration (≤4μg/ml) during the lead-in period. We call for a closer look at pediatric-focused dosing strategies for nevirapine initiation in young children. Further studies to establish age-appropriate threshold nevirapine concentration are warranted in young children to corroborate the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in predicting virological outcome."
8908,0.003,3.0000,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

1441,0.003,3.0000,"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy."
4563,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
8226,0.003,3.0000,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
2926,0.003,3.0000,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
8481,0.003,3.0000,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."
5080,0.003,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
321,0.003,3.0000,"Nosocomial multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people is recognized in Europe and America. We report the first such outbreak in South Africa. Six hospitalized women, identified by DNA fingerprinting, were infected with an outbreak strain of MDR-TB while receiving treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission."
572,0.003,3.0000,"Virus variants escaping from host immunity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."
9396,0.003,3.0000,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
8860,0.003,3.0000,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
6155,0.003,3.0000,"In hepatitis B virus carriers who are anti-HBe positive despite ongoing viral replication (HBcAg in liver and HBV-DNA in serum) the natural course of hepatitis is severe and the response to interferon is low. We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."
720,0.003,3.0000,"The scarcity of liver donors requires consideration of grafts from sources not previously used. Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."
2882,0.003,3.0000,"The source and dynamics of persistent HIV-1 during long-term combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) are critical to understanding the barriers to curing HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we isolated and genetically characterized HIV-1 DNA from naïve and memory T cells from peripheral blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from eight patients after 4-12 y of suppressive cART. Our detailed analysis of these eight patients indicates that persistent HIV-1 in peripheral blood and GALT is found primarily in memory CD4(+) T cells [CD45RO(+)/CD27((+/-))]. The HIV-1 infection frequency of CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood and GALT was higher in patients who initiated treatment during chronic compared with acute/early infection, indicating that early initiation of therapy results in lower HIV-1 reservoir size in blood and gut. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an HIV-1 genetic change between RNA sequences isolated before initiation of cART and intracellular HIV-1 sequences from the T-cell subsets after 4-12 y of suppressive cART in four of the eight patients. However, evolutionary rate analyses estimated no greater than three nucleotide substitutions per gene region analyzed during all of the 4-12 y of suppressive therapy. We also identified a clearly replication-incompetent viral sequence in multiple memory T cells in one patient, strongly supporting asynchronous cell replication of a cell containing integrated HIV-1 DNA as the source. This study indicates that persistence of a remarkably stable population of infected memory cells will be the primary barrier to a cure, and, with little evidence of viral replication, this population could be maintained by homeostatic cell proliferation or other processes.

8329,0.003,3.0000,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."

Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."
9116,0.003,3.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. In the United States, HBV infection is commonly associated with high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use or unprotected sex; but it is not as well-known among health care providers that HBV can be transmitted from mother to baby during birth. Worldwide, the majority of cases of chronic HBV infection are in people who contracted the virus during birth. There is a lack of awareness in the United States that immigrants from HBV-endemic countries may be at high risk for chronic HBV. Thus, at-risk individuals may not be screened for HBV. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend HBV screening for all people born in Asia, all U.S.-born persons who were unvaccinated as infants and whose parents were born in regions of high HBV endemicity (> or = 8%), and individuals with parenteral risk factors. Screening for HBV starts with HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HBsAb (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen), and total anti-HBc (total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) testing. For those who are HBV-negative (HBsAg-negative) and have no evidence of prior immunity, the three-part HBV vaccination series is recommended."
4002,0.002,2.0000,"Despite widely available and effective treatments, there are racial/ethnic disparities in HIV-related mortality rates. The reason for inadequate HIV/AIDS management among minority populations is not fully understood, however recent research indicates that patients rate the quality of their health care higher if they are racially/ethnically concordant with their providers. As trust plays prominently on health care ratings, we examined whether racial/ethnicity concordance was associated with two dimensions of trust, trust in the provider and mistrust in the health care system, in 380 HIV infected people New York City. In this sample, concordance was associated with lower mistrust in the health care system, but not with trust in provider. We conclude that in this patient population and within the health care system available to them, racial/ethnic concordance might be more important for helping patients to understand and navigate the health care system rather than in interpersonal relationships with a single provider."
9517,0.002,2.0000,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."
4120,0.002,2.0000,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
8689,0.002,2.0000,"CD4+ T cell counts and CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios represent key determinants of HIV disease progression and infectivity. However, the relationship between the HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response and these determinants has not been elucidated for all HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins. In the present study, virusspecific T cell responses to HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins were analyzed with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme- linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays using synthetic overlapping peptides corresponding to naturally occurring HIV-1B and HIV-1C consensus sequences. For Gag/Gag p24/Gag p17, a correlation between T cell responses and CD4+ T cell count in HIV-1 clade B and clade C was seen: elevated T cell response resulted in higher CD4+ T cell production. A statistically significant correlation between the Pol-specific T cell response and CD4+ T cell counts was also found in HIV-1 subtype C. For all HIV-1B and HIV-1C proteins, a correlation between the HIV-1-specific T cell response and CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratios was found for Tat and Pol proteins. CD4+ T cell counts in patients with Tat and/or Rev T cell response were higher than in patients without Tat and/or Rev T cell response. We suggest that this correlation within HIV-1B and HIV-1C Gag p24/Gag p17 responses makes the Gag p24/Gag p17 region a potential vaccine candidate and that HIV-1-specific CTL epitopes toward Pol are important in controlling HIV-1 infection; we emphasize that future vaccination strategies should include these early antigens, Tat and Rev."
5800,0.002,2.0000,"The intestinal tract is a lymphocyte-rich site that undergoes severe depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells within days of simian immunodeficiency virus or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. An ensuing influx of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, which persist throughout the chronic phase of infection, has also been documented in the gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known of the functionality of these effector cells or their relationship to the disease course. In this study, we measured CD8(+) T-cell responses to HIV-1 peptides in paired rectal and blood samples from chronically infected patients. In both blood and rectum, there was an immunodominant CD8(+) T-cell response to HIV Gag compared to Pol and Env (P < 0.01). In contrast, cytomegalovirus pp65 peptides elicited gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion strongly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) but weakly in rectal CD8(+) T cells (P = 0.015). Upon stimulation with HIV peptides, CD8(+) T cells from both sites were capable of mounting complex responses including degranulation (CD107 expression) and IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production. In rectal tissue, CD107 release was frequently coupled with production of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. In patients not on antiretroviral therapy, the magnitude of Gag-specific responses, as a percentage of CD8(+) T cells, was greater in the rectal mucosa than in PBMC (P = 0.054); however, the breakdown of responding cells into specific functional categories was similar in both sites. These findings demonstrate that rectal CD8(+) T cells are capable of robust and varied HIV-1-specific responses and therefore likely play an active role in eliminating infected cells during chronic infection."
4724,0.002,2.0000,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
258,0.002,2.0000,"Several members of the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve, with CD4, as coreceptors for entry by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). While coreceptor usage by HIV-1 primary isolates has been studied by several groups, there is only limited information available concerning coreceptor usage by primary HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we have analyzed coreceptor usage of 15 primary HIV-2 isolates, using lymphocytes from a donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5 -/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). Based on the infections of PBMCs, seven of these primary isolates had an absolute requirement for CCR5 expression, whereas the remaining eight exhibited a broader coreceptor usage. All CCR5-requiring isolates were non-syncytium inducing, whereas isolates utilizing multiple coreceptors were syncytium inducing. Blocking experiments using known ligands for chemokine receptors provided indirect evidence for additional coreceptor utilization by primary HIV-2 isolates. Analysis of GHOST4 cell lines expressing various chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, BONZO, and BOB) further defined specific coreceptor usage of primary HIV-2 isolates. The receptors used included CXCR4, CCR1-5, and the recently described receptors BONZO and BOB. However, the efficiency at which the coreceptors were utilized varied greatly among the various isolates. Analysis of V3 envelope sequences revealed no specific motif that correlated with coreceptor usage. Our data demonstrate that primary HIV-2 isolates are capable of using a broad range of coreceptors for productive infection in vitro. Additionally, our data suggest that expanded coreceptor usage by HIV-2 may correlate with disease progression."
4913,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses are endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, but data regarding the prevalence of hepatitis co-infections in HIV-positive individuals residing there are limited. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
3791,0.002,2.0000,"OBJECTIVE. To serially evaluate the viral kinetics of occult hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients and perform a correlation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN. Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION. Detectable baseline serum hepatitis B virus DNA is not uncommon in patients with occult hepatitis B who receive chemotherapy. Transient elevation in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels does not predict biochemical reactivation, but antiviral treatment might be considered if virological rebound persists."
306,0.002,2.0000,"Cellular immune responses during acute Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection are a known correlate of infection outcome. Viral adaptation to these responses via mutation(s) within CD8+ T-cell epitopes allows these viruses to subvert host immune control. This study examined HCV evolution in 21 HCV genotype 1-infected subjects to characterise the level of viral adaptation during acute and early HCV infection. Of the total mutations observed 25% were within described CD8+ T-cell epitopes or at viral adaptation sites. Most mutations were maintained into the chronic phase of HCV infection (75%). The lack of reversion of adaptations and high proportion of silent substitutions suggests that HCV has structural and functional limitations that constrain evolution. These results were compared to the pattern of viral evolution observed in 98 subjects during a similar phase in HIV infection from a previous study. In contrast to HCV, evolution during acute HIV infection is marked by high levels of amino acid change relative to silent substitutions, including a higher proportion of adaptations, likely reflecting strong and continued CD8+ T-cell pressure combined with greater plasticity of the virus. Understanding viral escape dynamics for these two viruses is important for effective T cell vaccine design."
3236,0.002,2.0000,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
8080,0.002,2.0000,"The clinical course and outcome of HIV-1 infection are highly variable among individuals. Interleukin 4 (IL-4) is a key T helper 2 cytokine with various immune-modulating functions including induction of immunoglobulin E (IgE) production in B cells, downregulation of CCR5 and upregulation of CXCR4, the main co-receptors for HIV. Our objective is to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-4 promoter 589 C/T and IL-4 Ralpha I50V affect the susceptibility to HIV infection and its progression to AIDS in North Indian individuals. The study population consisted of 180 HIV-1 seropositive (HSP) stratified on the basis of disease severity (stage I, II, III), 50 HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HES), and 305 HIV-1 seronegative (HSN) individuals. The subjects were genotyped for IL-4 589 C/T promoter polymorphism and IL-4 Ralpha I50V by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. The results showed that IL-4 589 C/T was not associated with the risk of HIV infection and disease progression. However, the IL-4Ralpha I50 allele and genotype was significantly increased in HSP compared to HSN and HSP and was associated with risk of HIV infection. The frequency of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele in the HSP group was higher than in HSN (76.11 vs. 64.75%; P = 0.000; OR = 1.734) and HES (76.11% vs. 62.00%; P = 0.007; OR = 1.953). Homozygous IL-4Ralpha I50I genotype was significantly increased in HSP group compared with HSN (58.88% vs. 44.26%; P = 0.002; OR = 1.804) and HES (58.88% vs. 42.00%; P = 0.038; OR = 1.978). The present study for the first time suggests an association of IL-4Ralpha I50 allele with increased likelihood of HIV-1 infection in North Indian population. Further studies are required to confirm these findings and understand the effect of IL-4Ralpha polymorphism on the outcome of HIV-1 infection."
2321,0.002,2.0000,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."
2568,0.002,2.0000,"Background Portugal has the highest prevalence rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."
3769,0.002,2.0000,"The efficacy of specifically targeted anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (STAT-C), including HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors, is limited by the presence of drug-specific viral resistance mutations within the targeted proteins. Genetic diversity within these viral proteins also evolves under selective pressures provided by host human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted immune responses, which may therefore influence STAT-C treatment response. Here, the prevalence of drug resistance mutations relevant to 27 developmental STAT-C drugs, and the potential for drug and immune selective pressures to intersect at sites along the HCV genome, is explored. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 protease or NS5B polymerase sequences and HLA assignment were obtained from study populations from Australia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Four hundred five treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HCV infection were considered (259 genotype 1, 146 genotype 3), of which 38.5% were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We identified preexisting STAT-C drug resistance mutations in sequences from this large cohort. The frequency of the variations varied according to individual STAT-C drug and HCV genotype/subtype. Of individuals infected with subtype 1a, 21.5% exhibited genetic variation at a known drug resistance site. Furthermore, we identified areas in HCV protease and polymerase that are under both potential HLA-driven pressure and therapy selection and identified six HLA-associated polymorphisms (P <or= 0.05) at known drug resistance sites."
2295,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

9898,0.002,2.0000,"Retroviral integrase catalyzes the essential step of integrating a double-stranded DNA copy of the viral genome into a host cell chromosome. Mutational studies have revealed that integrase is involved in additional steps of viral replication, but the mechanism for the pleiotropic effect is not well characterized. Since Cys residues generally play crucial roles in protein structure and function, we introduced Cys-to-Ser substitutions at positions 56, 65, and 130 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase to determine their effects on integration activity and viral replication. None of the substitutions significantly affected the enzymatic activities in vitro. When introduced into the NL4-3 molecular clone of HIV-1, mutant viruses encoding Cys mutations at positions 56 and 65 of integrase replicated similarly to the wild-type virus in CD4(+)-T-cell lines, whereas the C130S-containing virus was noninfectious. The entry and postintegration steps of the viral life cycle for all mutant viruses were normal, and all had particle-associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. However, early reverse-transcribed DNA products were absent in the lysate of cells infected with the C130S mutant virus, indicating that the mutation abolished the ability of the virus to initiate endogenous reverse transcription. Coimmunoprecipitation using purified integrase and RT showed that the C-terminal domain of wild-type HIV-1 integrase interacted with RT. The interaction between integrase and RT was not affected in the presence of a reducing or alkylating agent, suggesting that the interaction did not involve a disulfide linkage. The C130S substitution within the core region may disrupt the protein recognition interface of the C-terminal domain and abolish its ability to interact with RT. Our results indicate that integrase plays an important role during the reverse-transcription step of the viral life cycle, possibly through physical interactions with RT."
2393,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The outcome of HBV infection is largely determined by the host immune response, with virus-specific cytotoxic T cells being able to mediate immunity against HBV as well as causing liver pathology. γδ T cells are reported to be depleted in patients with HBV-associated liver disease. However, it is not known if these cells control HBV infection in patients with asymptomatic chronic HBV infection. In this study, the frequencies, phenotypes, and interferon-γ production were examined by circulating γδ T cell subsets in a group of asymptomatic HBV carriers with low viral loads and little evidence of liver disease. It is shown that γδ T cells expressing Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cell receptors and effector-memory phenotypes are found at higher frequencies in these patients compared to controls. Vδ2 T cells from the patients expressed interferon-γ significantly more frequently than Vδ2 T cells from healthy donors in the absence of ex vivo stimulation. These data suggest that effector-memory IFN-γ-producing Vδ2 T cells may contribute to the control of HBV in patients with asymptomatic infection, without mediating liver pathology. "
4782,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of chronic hepatitis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma throughout the world. Considerable evidence indicates that the risk of viral persistence, natural history, and response to antiviral therapy varies among racial groups, but limited data exist on potential mechanisms to account for these differences. Type 1 helper (Th1) responses to HCV proteins and cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigens were examined using a sensitive interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay in 187 Caucasian American (CA) and 187 African American (AA) patients with chronic genotype 1 infection. ELISPOT responses were examined relative to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles and outcome of therapy with pegylated IFN and ribavirin. Th1 responses specific to hepatitis C core protein and combined HCV antigens were significantly lower in AAs compared to CAs, but CMV responses were comparable in the 2 races. The HCV difference in immunity remained after adjusting for gender, serum alanine aminotransferase, histologic severity, and viral level, and was not accounted for by the differential prevalence of human leukocyte antigen class II alleles. Pretreatment total HCV-specific CD4+ T cell response was associated with sustained virologic response (SVR) to pegylated IFN and ribavirin; 43% of patients who had more than 168 ELISPOTs/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (above background) experienced SVR compared to 28% of those who did not (P= 0.007). ELISPOT response was independently associated with SVR by multivariable analysis."
4887,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is characterized by an impaired immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV). Telbivudine treatment has significantly improved the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection. However, the underlying mechanism behind the antiviral response of patients treated with nucleoside analogs remains unclear. To gather more evidence about the mechanism responsible for the weak immune response, in this study we analyzed the effects on HBV viral load of treatment with the nucleoside analogue telbivudine and the percentage of Tregs, programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and related cytokine production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum of 28 patients with chronic hepatitis B were collected at baseline, and 3 mo and 6 mo after therapy was begun. In parallel with the decline in viral load and serum ALT normalization, we found a decline in circulating CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs, PD-L1 on CD4(+) T cells, and IL-9 production. The expression of PD-1 on CD4(+) T cells and the production of IFN-γ did not increase during therapy. Our findings suggest that the antiviral effect of the nucleoside analogs may be attributable not only to their direct effect on virus suppression, but also to their immunoregulatory capabilities."
1509,0.002,2.0000,"Several recent studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have identified micronutrient deficiencies as affecting progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death. Although the mechanisms are not known, micronutrient deficiencies may exacerbate the oxidative stress induced by HIV. In addition, infection and its evolution likely lead to an increased requirement for nutritional micronutrients, especially antioxidants. To evaluate this, 40 relatively healthy, institutionalized HIV-infected individuals were recruited for assessment before or three months after fresh fruit and vegetable supply were increased due to seasonal supply. Seven-day dietary records were recorded at the beginning (December) and end of the three-month study period (March). Oxidative stress indices and CD4+, CD38+/CD8+, and CD95+ T-lymphocyte subsets were also measured at these times. No significant differences were found in calorie or protein intake across the study period, but vitamin A, C, and E intakes all increased. A number of redox indicators were modified (increase: total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione; and decrease: superoxide dismutase) during the study period. However, no change in malondialdehyde, hydroperoxides, or DNA damage was noted but a significant reduction in CD38+/CD8+ relative count was seen. Within the context and limitations of this study, the increase of dietary fruits and vegetables intake for three months had some beneficial effects on nutrition, systemic redox balance, and immune parameters in HIV-infected persons."
3284,0.002,2.0000,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
6357,0.002,2.0000,"To identify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype on development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and clinical outcome in chronic HBV infection, 26 consecutive cirrhotic patients infected with HBV subtype adw were investigated prospectively. HBV serology was undertaken using subtype-specific antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigens. The HBV genotype was determined by sequencing directly the polymerase chain reaction products of the HBV S gene. When HCC occurred, patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization therapy. If tumor necrosis was incomplete, additional embolization therapy was carried out after a 3- to 4-month interval. At a median follow-up of 14.1 years (range 2.2 to 31.7), HCC occurred in 9 (35%) of 26 patients. Nineteen patients were infected with genotype B and 7 with genotype C. Four of the 19 genotype B patients (21%) and 5 of the 7 genotype C patients (71%) developed HCC (P = 0.058). Patient age (<45 years or 45 < or = ) at diagnosis of cirrhosis was the only significant independent factor influencing liver carcinogenesis by multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox's regression analysis (P = 0.0069 and 0.029, respectively). When analysis was limited to the age of 45 years or more at the last visit, genotype was the only contributory factor to HCC development by univariate analysis (P = 0.038). Whereas genotype B patients responded well to embolization therapy and had no recurrence of HCC for a prolonged period of time, genotype C patients showed poor responses and died of hepatic failure due to rapid HCC progression despite embolization therapy. The cumulative incidence of survival was significantly higher in the genotype B group (P = 0.0049). The HBV genotype correlated with the development of HCC, response to embolization therapy, and recurrence of HCC. Determination of HBV genotype may be useful in predicting outcomes in HBV subtype adw-related cirrhosis."
4787,0.002,2.0000,"Since its widespread introduction, the hepatitis B vaccine has become an essential part of infant immunization programmes globally. The vaccine has been particularly important for countries where the incidence of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma is high. Effective treatment options for individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection were limited until 1998 when lamivudine, the first nucleoside analogue drug, was introduced. As a single treatment agent, however, lamivudine has a significant drawback: it induces lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus strains that may pose a risk to the global hepatitis B immunization programme. Mutations associated with drug treatment can cause changes to the surface antigen protein, the precise part of the virus that the hepatitis B vaccine mimics. However, the emergence of antiviral drug-associated potential vaccine escape mutants (ADAP-VEMs) in treated patients does not necessarily pose a significant, imminent threat to the global hepatitis B immunization programme. Nonetheless, there is already evidence that current treatment regimens have resulted in the selection of stable ADAP-VEMs. Treatment is currently intended to prevent the long-term complications of hepatitis B virus infection, with little consideration given to potential adverse public health impacts. To address individual and public health concerns, trials are urgently needed to find the optimal combination of existing drugs that are effective but do not induce the emergence of ADAP-VEMs. This paper examines the mechanism of antiviral drug-selected changes in the portion of the viral genome that also affects the surface antigen, and explores their potential impact on current hepatitis B immunization programmes."
2155,0.002,2.0000,"Protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 has hardly ever been detected at failed boosted PI-based first-line antiretroviral regimens in clinical trials. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in clinical practice. To address this gap, data from patients starting a first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv)-based therapy with available baseline HIV-1 RNA load, a viral genotype and follow-up viral load after 3 and 6 months of treatment were extracted from the Italian Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA) observational database. Based on survival analysis, 39 (7.1%) and 43 (7.8%) of the 548 examined patient cases had an HIV-1 RNA >500 and >50 copies/ml, respectively, after 6 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard models detected baseline HIV-1 RNA (RH 1.79, 95%CI 1.10-2.92 per 1-log(10) increase, P=0.02) and resistance to the nucleoside backbone (RH 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 10-point increase using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, P<0.001) as independent predictors of HIV-1 RNA at >500 copies/ml, but not at the >50 copies/ml cutoff criteria. Higher baseline viral load, older patient age, heterosexual route of infection and use of tenofovir/emtricitabine were predictors of failure at month 3 using the 50-copy and/or 500-copy threshold. Resistance to LPV/rtv did not occur or increase in any of the available 36 follow-up HIV-1 genotypes. Resistance to the nucleoside backbone (M184V) developed in four cases. Despite the likely differences in patient population and adherence, both the low rate of virological failure and the lack of development of LPV/rtv resistance documented in clinical trials are thus confirmed in clinical practice."
9922,0.002,2.0000,"Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) usually results in outgrowth of viruses with macrophage-tropic phenotype and consensus non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) V3 loop sequences, despite the presence of virus with broader host range and the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype in the blood of many donors. We examined proviruses in contemporaneous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and non-spermatozoal semen mononuclear cells (NSMC) of five HIV-1-infected individuals to determine if this preferential outgrowth could be due to compartmentalization and thus preferential transmission of viruses of the NSI phenotype from the male genital tract. Phylogenetic reconstructions of approximately 700-bp sequences covering the second constant region through the fifth variable region (C2 to V5) of the viral envelope gene revealed distinct variant populations in the blood versus the semen in two patients with AIDS and in one asymptomatic individual (patient 613), whereas similar variant populations were found in both compartments in two other asymptomatic individuals. Variants with amino acids in the V3 loop that predict the SI phenotype were found in both AIDS patients and in patient 613; however, the distribution of these variants between the two compartments was not consistent. SI variants were found only in the PBMC of one AIDS patient but only in the NSMC of the other, while they were found in both compartments in patient 613. It is therefore unlikely that restriction of SI variants from the male genital tract accounts for the observed NSI transmission bias. Furthermore, no evidence for a semen-specific signature amino acid sequence was detected."
6856,0.002,2.0000,"To determine role of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and additional factors in incidence and outcome of patients with AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) we retrospectively analyzed 257 cases of AIDS-related NHL (24 low-grade, 168 high-grade B-cell, 6 high-grade T-cell, and 59 primary CNS lymphomas (PCNSL) among 2004 patients with HIV-infection treated at the University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany from January 1983 to May 1999. Data were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses, using overall survival as end point. Patients received CHOP-like therapy as standard treatment. Until May 1999 incidence of all diagnosed cases of NHL was decreasing (1991-94: 14.2% versus 1995-5/99: 12.8%). Mainly, the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL clearly decreased whereas the incidence of high-grade B-cell NHL increased compared to all diagnosed cases of NHL (1983-86: 53.3% versus 1995-5/99: 78.6%). One-year survival probability of all screened patients with AIDS related NHL was 54%, while 5-year survival rate remained 5%. We found age <25 years, development of NHL in the years before 1990, IVDU, CD4 counts <150/microl, PCNSL as well as NHL as the AIDS index disease, to be highly significant independent predictors of poor survival, including increased hazard ratios. In the era of HAART incidence of NHL is decreasing, mainly the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL. Overall survival of patients has been prolonged with HAART. This development is mainly due to improvement of antiretroviral therapy, rather than to any fundamental changes in the chemotherapeutic treatment of NHL. Therefore, new treatment approaches for AIDS-related NHL should focus on more efficient antiretroviral therapy in association with combination chemotherapy."
343,0.002,2.0000,"Advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment or prophylaxis against opportunistic infection have resulted in prolongation of the survival of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Previous research has demonstrated an association between AIDS and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In addition to the approximately 3% of individuals found to have NHL at the time of AIDS onset, others continue to develop NHL following AIDS diagnosis. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute demonstrated a sharply increasing incidence of NHL among men in the age range 20-49 years since 1983 in the United States. Based on new data on the risk of NHL following AIDS diagnosis, on estimates of improved survival following AIDS diagnosis, and on projections of future AIDS incidence, we considered four sets of assumptions and estimated the number of AIDS-related NHL cases in 1992 to be between 2900 and 9800. Three of these projections were higher than the estimate of 4700 cases obtained by linear extrapolation of SEER incidence trends. These projections of AIDS-related NHL incidence suggest that between 8% and 27% of all NHL cases that occur in the United States in 1992 will arise as a consequence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), imposing a substantial health care burden. More research into the pathogenesis of lymphoma and new approaches to antiretroviral and antilymphoma therapy will be necessary to prevent and treat this formidable complication of infection with HIV."
7640,0.002,2.0000,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."
7730,0.002,2.0000,"A cohort of 148 consecutive patients with hepatitis C virus infection were studied at the rheumatology out-patient clinic of a tertiary care teaching hospital. The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection was supported by detection of HCV RNA in the serum. Cryoglobulin screening was done in all patients and the presence of a monoclonal component was investigated when the cryocrit was higher than 1%. Patients with lymphoproliferative disorders were further investigated. Four patients had a B lymphoproliferative disorder, which represents a prevalence of 2.7% in this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection. Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), with cryocrit higher than 1%, was found in 16 of 148 patients (11%). It was type III MC in 13 patients and type II MC in 3. All patients who developed a B lymphoproliferative disorder had mixed cryoglobulinemia, with a monoclonal component (type II MC) in two patients and without a monoclonal component (type III MC) in the other two. The incidence of B-lymphoproliferative disorders among this cohort of patients with hepatitis C virus infection seems to be significantly increased. However, the high frequency of asymptomatic, undiagnosed HCV infection among the apparently healthy general population may decrease the true significance of this association. Systematic screening of cryoglobulin production in patients with hepatitis C virus infection might clarify whether the risk of B lymphoproliferative disorders increases when type II or type III mixed cryoglobulinemia is present."
3646,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (EC) maintain viremia below the limit of commercial assay detection (<50 RNA copies/ml) in the absence of antiviral therapy, but the mechanisms of control remain unclear. HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
4804,0.002,2.0000,"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."
9554,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the overall clinical expression characteristics of the cluster of differentiation (CD)28 family receptors [CD28, inducible T-cell co-stimulator, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and B‑ and T-lymphocyte attenuator] on T cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), analyze the correlations among these receptors and the clinical parameters, and to investigate the effects of PD‑1 blockade on the receptor expression profiles, T‑cell function and other biological effects. The expression characteristics of the CD28 family of receptors, the effects of PD‑1 blockade on the receptor expression profiles and the levels of interferon (IFN)‑γ were investigated in the T cells of patients with CHB. In addition, the transcription factor, T‑box 21 (T‑bet) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA‑3) mRNA expression levels were investigated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with CHB. The expression levels of the CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB demonstrated distinct characteristics , for example levels of PD‑1 and CTLA‑4 on CD4 T cells and ICOS, PD‑1, and BTLA on CD8 T cells were increased in cells from patients with CHB compared with those from the healthy individuals. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated among the serum HBV DNA titers and the levels of PD‑1 on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of PD‑1 corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. A significant positive correlation was observed between the serum HBV DNA titers and the expression levels of BTLA on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of BTLA corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. PD‑1 blockade altered the expression profiles of CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB, partly enhanced T cell function and increased the ratio of T‑bet/GATA‑3 mRNA in PBMCs. Thus, CD28 family receptors are potential clinical indicators for the rapid monitoring of changes in T cell function during CHB treatment. Furthermore, PD‑1 blockade has a therapeutic potential that may be enhanced by modulating the expression of co-stimulatory and -inhibitory receptors of the CD28 family. "

Risk factors for reduced BMD in the setting of HIV have been previously studied, but detailed antiretroviral treatment history is often not available. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between 2005 and 2007 among unselected HIV-infected adults attending an ambulatory urban HIV clinic. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of lumbar spine and femoral neck, full laboratory profile, detailed questionnaire, and antiretroviral history were obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with BMD below the expected range for age. Two hundred ninety patients completed the study: 80% Caucasians, 89% males, with median age of 49 yr. Low BMD as assessed by Z-score was present in 19.7% of the patients. By multivariate analysis, only lower body mass index (BMI) was an independent risk factor for low BMD. Cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides, and individual nucleoside and nucleotide analogs were not independently associated with low BMD. In conclusion, a 19.7% prevalence of abnormal BMD by DXA scan was identified in an unselected group of HIV-infected adults. Lower BMI was independently associated with low BMD. No correlation was found between abnormal BMD and cumulative exposure to any antiretroviral agents."
9621,0.002,2.0000,"The continual improvement in outcome with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and visceral transplantation for gut failure stimulated our interest in lifting HIV infection as a contraindication for intestinal and multivisceral transplantation. This report is the first to describe visceral transplantation in a patient with HIV infection. A HAART regimen was introduced in the setting of short-gut syndrome with successful suppression of HIV viral load. The indication for en bloc multivisceral and kidney transplantation was end-stage liver failure with portomesenteric venous thrombosis and chronic renal insufficiency. The underlying hepatic pathology was alcoholic and home parenteral nutrition-associated cirrhosis. Surgery was complicated due to technical difficulties with excessive blood loss and long operative time. The complex posttransplant course included multiple exploratory laparotomies due to serious intra-abdominal and systemic infections. Heavy immunosuppression was required to treat recurrent episodes of severe allograft rejection. Posttransplant oral HAART successfully sustained undetectable viral load. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to sepsis 3 months posttransplant. With new insights into the biology of gut immunity, mechanisms of allograft tolerance, and HIV-associated immune dysregulation, successful outcome is anticipated, particularly in patients who are in need of isolated intestinal and less-organ-contained visceral allografts.

8438,0.002,2.0000,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

464,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."
4109,0.002,2.0000,"Liver disease is currently the second leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons in Western countries. Hepatitis C virus infection accounts for the majority of cases of hepatic illness in this population. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients, many challenges still remain unsolved. The combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of choice in hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected patients, regardless of hepatitis C virus genotype. However, the limited efficacy of this therapy in the HIV setting makes necessary the development of new strategies and/or drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Several anti-hepatitis C virus compounds are currently under investigation, although most are still in the early stages of clinical development. There is a relatively large group of patients who will be unable to be treated with the current hepatitis C virus medication based on interferon, mainly due to contraindications such as serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular history. However, for those without contraindications, treatment should be provided with no restrictions at the start (e.g. asking unnecessarily for a liver biopsy), and reassessed at weeks 4 and 12, considering virologic responses. Treatment should only be continued in early virologic responders. The use of standard doses of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and for at least 12 months seems crucial to maximize the effect of current hepatitis C treatment in the HIV setting, while no further benefit seems to derive from using higher than recommended pegylated interferon dosages. In patients with rapid virologic response (undetectable viremia at week 4) to anti-hepatitis C therapy, shorter periods of therapy (24 weeks) may be advisable in hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3. Finally, adequate selection of candidates and careful selection of concomitant antiretroviral medications must be encouraged. Patients with low CD4 percentages (< 15%) should be deferred for treatment and HAART prioritized in order to improve CD4 counts. When possible, nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and abacavir should be replaced by others having no deleterious interactions with ribavirin (e.g. tenofovir, lamivudine, or emtricitabine). Didanosine should never be coadministered with ribavirin due to potential life-threatening complications."
2003,0.002,2.0000,"The ability of HIV-1 to evolve resistance to antiretroviral drugs leads to treatment failure. By nucleotide sequencing of HIV-1 subtype B isolates, amino acids responsible for drug resistance have been identified. Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these amino acids in HIV-1 nonsubtype B viruses circulating mainly in developing countries. More HIV-infected patients in the developing world are now using antiretroviral drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 non-subtype B viruses. This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 28 antiretroviral drug-naive HIV-1-infected Zambians. HIV-1 proviral DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The region encompassing gag p17 to env C2-V3-C3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analyses for drug resistance-associated mutations in th e protease and reverse transcriptase genes, and HIV-1 subtyping, were done. Overall, 92.8% of the generated sequences were HIV-1 subtype C. The generated sequences revealed only secondary associated, but no primary, drug-resistance mutations The most frequent secondary mutations in the protease and RT genes were, respectively, I93L(91.7%), L89M (79.2%), M3611V (79%, 4.2%), and R211K (70.8%), S48T (62.5%). The atypical residues M41N (3.6%) and D67A (3.6%) were detected in the RT gene. This study reveals many naturally occurring polymorphisms in HIV-1 subtype C isolates from antiretroviral drug-naive individuals. Such polymorphisms could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant HIV-1 mutants in individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy."

DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."
7066,0.002,2.0000,"Viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major health problem for women. Over many years the incidence of these infections has increased steadily to epidemic proportions. These infections not only cause short-term morbidity but also have been associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. This paper focuses on two of the most common viral STDs-Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection of the female. The steady increase in the incidence of HIV infection and subsequent adult immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) among women requires health care providers to assume an active role in detection and treatment in order to avoid transmission, to protect the health of women with HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission. Because treatment with zidovudine has been shown to reduce vertical transmission, routine offering of HIV testing is currently recommended for all pregnant women. The approach to testing nonpregnant patients, i.e., the choice between selective screening or routine testing, rests with the individual clinician. Testing large numbers of patients within a practice may be facilitated by the availability of an oral antibody testing system. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral test is equivalent to blood testing. Serum and oral specimens are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot assays specifically designed for use with oral samples. Controversies in diagnosis as well as the most updated treatments for these infections are discussed."
1306,0.002,2.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus associated with AIDS-like illnesses in cats. As such, FIV appears to be a feline analog of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A hallmark of HIV infection is the large degree of viral genetic diversity that can develop within an infected individual and the even greater and continually increasing level of diversity among virus isolates from different individuals. Our goal in this study was to determine patterns of FIV genetic diversity by focusing on a 684-nucleotide region encompassing variable regions V3, V4, and V5 of the FIV env gene in order to establish parallels and distinctions between FIV and HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Our data demonstrate that, like HIV-1, FIV can be separated into distinct envelope sequence subtypes (three are described here). Similar to that found for HIV-1, the pairwise sequence divergence within an FIV subtype ranged from 2.5 to 15.0%, whereas that between subtypes ranged from 17.8 to 26.2%. However, the high number of synonymous nucleotide changes among FIV V3 to V5 env sequences may also include a significant number of back mutations and suggests that the evolutionary distances among FIV subtypes are underestimated. Although only a few subtype B viruses were available for examination, the pattern of diversity between the FIV A and B subtypes was found to be significantly distinct; subtype B sequences had proportionally fewer mutations that changed amino acids, compared with silent changes, suggesting a more advanced state of adaptation to the host. No similar distinction was evident for HIV-1 subtypes. The diversity of FIV genomes within individual infected cats was found to be as high as 3.7% yet twofold lower than that within HIV-1-infected people over a comparable region of the env gene. Despite these differences, significant parallels between patterns of FIV evolution and HIV-1 evolution exist, indicating that a wide array of potentially divergent virus challenges need to be considered in FIV vaccine and pathogenesis studies."
9206,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission results from infection with one or a small number of variants from the donor quasispecies. Transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses have recently been identified from acutely infected patients, but the way in which they interact with primary targets of HIV-1 infection is poorly understood. We have conducted a biological characterization of a panel of subtype B T/F acute and chronic envelope (Env)-expressing chimeric virus in primary human target cells and mucosal tissues. Both acute and chronic Envs preferentially replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and a CD4 T-cell line compared to monocyte-derived macrophages, or dendritic cells (DC). In a model of trans infection from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to T cells, chimeric virus from acute Envs achieved significantly lower titers compared to chronic Envs. Challenge of primary human mucosal tissues revealed significantly higher levels of replication in chronic Env-expressing virus in rectal tissue compared to cervical and penile tissues and enhanced replication in tonsillar tissue relative to acute Envs. In agreement with data from the DC to T-cell trans infection assay, chronic Env-chimeric virus pools were transmitted more efficiently by migratory cells from cervical and penile tissues to CD4(+) T cells than individual acute Env chimeras. These data indicate that virus with HIV-1 Envs of transmitted acute infections preferentially replicate in T cells rather than macrophages or dendritic cells and are less efficiently transmitted from antigen-presenting cells to CD4 T cells than chronic Envs. Such properties together with chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) use may confer an advantage for transmission."
2630,0.002,2.0000,"In the five-year period between 1989 and 1993, 87 needlestick accidents occurred among healthcare workers at our hospital. Thirty-seven (43%) of these needlestick accidents involved blood contaminated with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and two of them (5.4%) led to the occurrence of hepatitis C infection. Case 1 was a 43-year-old nurse who was accidentally injured by a needle contaminated with blood from a patient who had cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis C. Acute hepatitis C occurred after five weeks and HCV RNA was positive after eight weeks. Case 2 was a 33-year-old nurse who was injured by a needle contaminated with blood from a patient who had chronic hepatitis C. Liver function was normal at 11 days after the accident. However, hepatitis C was diagnosed 21 months later after she had successfully given birth to her baby. The nucleotide sequence of the HCV E2/NS1 region was determined in the two patients and the needlestick victims, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by molecular evolutionary analysis. On the basis of these trees, transmission of HCV could be confirmed in both cases. This method of analysis may be useful for confirming the transmission of HCV even long after the event."
4240,0.002,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
5412,0.002,2.0000,"We have investigated the frequency of resistance mutations to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 37 Korean HIV-1-infected patients, 22 of whom had experienced previous monotherapy. CD4(+) T cell counts significantly increased from 135 +/- 110/microl to 523 +/- 259/microl for 39 +/- 3 months by HAART (p < 0.0001). Over 39 +/- 3 months of HAART, 18 of 37 patients (48.6%) harbored drug resistance mutations. The most frequently observed mutation was M184V (24.3%, 9/37). Seven of 35 patients (20.0%) exposed to protease inhibitors and 2 of 11 (18.2%) exposed to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors developed resistance mutations to their respective drugs. When we measured HIV-1 RNA viral loads over 30 months of HAART in 31 patients, we found that 13 patients (41.9%) showed virological treatment failure, with viral load >400 copies/ml. In conclusion, we found that the frequency of resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs over 30 months was high in HAART-treated patients. As the first report on resistance mutations to HAART in Korea, our data suggest that genotyping-guided treatment as well as education for compliance are required for better care."
3609,0.002,2.0000,"Few reports have examined the impact of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in resource-limited settings where there are fewer regimen choices and limited pretherapy/posttherapy resistance testing. In this study, we examined TDR prevalence in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda and assessed its virologic consequences after antiretroviral therapy initiation. We sequenced the HIV-1 protease/reverse transcriptase from n=81 and n=491 treatment-naive participants of the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) pilot study in Kampala (AMU 2002-2004) and main cohort in Mbarara (MBA 2005-2010). TDR-associated mutations were defined by the WHO 2009 surveillance mutation list. Posttreatment viral load data were available for both populations. Overall TDR prevalence was 7% (Kampala) and 3% (Mbarara) with no significant time trend. There was a slight but statistically nonsignificant trend indicating that the presence of TDR was associated with a worse treatment outcome. Virologic suppression (≤400 copies/ml within 6 months posttherapy initiation) was achieved in 87% and 96% of participants with wildtype viruses versus 67% and 83% of participants with TDR (AMU, MBA p=0.2 and 0.1); time to suppression (log-rank p=0.3 and p=0.05). Overall, 85% and 96% of study participants achieved suppression regardless of TDR status. Surprisingly, among the TDR cases, approximately half still achieved suppression; the presence of pretherapy K103N while on nevirapine and fewer active drugs in the first regimen were most often observed with failures. The majority of patients benefited from the local HIV care system even without resistance monitoring. Overall, TDR prevalence was relatively low and its presence did not always imply treatment failure."
6755,0.002,2.0000,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."
3156,0.002,2.0000,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."
9034,0.002,2.0000,"As per global HIV/AIDS estimates, a total of 33 million [30.3 - 36.1 million] People were living with HIV in 2007. The world's second-most populous country, India, is experiencing a highly varied HIV epidemic, which appears to be stable or diminishing in some parts while growing at a modest rate in others. Quality of life (QOL) of HIV/AIDS patients is becoming an important component of overall assessment of health care and management in health care settings. It is one of the indicators effectiveness of management of PLHAS. The objective of this study was to determine the QOL of patients with HIV/AIDS in New Delhi. Purposive sampling was used to identify subjects from the antiretroviral therapy clinic (ART) in Lok Nayak hospital. 180 patients were interviewed with the WHOQOL-HIV instrument. This questionnaire included demographic data, multi-item scales and six domains namely physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environment and spirituality religion. Study subjects were aged between 20-56 years. Mean age of all study subjects was 33.85 +/- 7.01 years, comprising of 34.4 females. More than 50% of the total subjects had received less than secondary school education. All domains have higher scores for women than men except the psychological domain. Correlation of scores of six domains with overall QOL score and among individual domains was statistically significant. Younger people showed poorer QOL and level of education correlated positively with all domains of QOL Overall results indicate that quality of life of AIDS attending Lok Nayak hospital is satisfactory."
6110,0.002,2.0000,"We evaluated the association between two antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence measurements--the medication possession ratio (MPR) and patient self-report--and detectable HIV viremia in the setting of rapid service scale-up in Lusaka, Zambia. Drug adherence and outcomes were assessed in a subset of patients suspected of treatment failure based on discordant clinical and immunologic responses to ART. A total of 913 patients were included in this analysis, with a median time of 744 days (Q1, Q3: 511, 919 days) from ART initiation to viral load (VL) measurement. On aggregate over the period of follow-up, 531 (58%) had optimal adherence (MPR > or =95%), 306 (34%) had suboptimal adherence (MPR 80-94%), and 76 (8%) had poor adherence (MPR <80%). Of the 913 patients, 238 (26%) had VL > or =400 copies/ml when tested. When compared to individuals with optimal adherence, there was increasing risk for virologic failure in those with suboptimal adherence [adjusted relative risk (ARR): 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.6] and those with poor adherence (ARR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) based on MPR. During the antiretroviral treatment course, 676 patients (74%) reported no missed doses. The proportion of patients with virologic failure did not differ significantly among those reporting any missed dose from those reporting perfect adherence (26% vs. 26%, p = 0.97). Among patients with suspected treatment failure, a lower MPR was associated with higher rates of detectable viremia. However, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of MPR limit its utility as a sole predictor of virologic failure."
2102,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."

Potent anti-HBV therapy is available and can be used to improve outcomes by suppressing HBV DNA. Many HBV agents have dual activity with HIV and may be used to treat both diseases. However, care must be taken when using HBV nucleos(t)ides that have not been fully studied in the HIV-infected population because the emergence of strains resistant to HIV treatment has been reported. Careful monitoring of response to treatment is needed when treating an HIV/HBV patient with severe immune suppression. Improved ability to obtain long-term HBV DNA suppression and avoid resistance will translate into improved survival in this population."
4921,0.002,2.0000,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."

Each co-formulated tablet will contain 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg of emtricitabine. Emtricitabine [Emtriva] is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with demonstrated potent activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It was first approved in the US by the FDA in July 2003 and is indicated for adults aged > or =18 years. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established. In antiretroviral-treatment-experienced patients, the use of emtricitabine may be considered for adults with HIV strains that are expected to be susceptible to the drug as assessed by genotypic or phenotypic testing. The recommended dose of emtricitabine is one 200 mg capsule daily, with or without food. In the European Union, emtricitabine is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV in adults and children, where it is also licensed as an oral 10 mg/mL solution. The oral solution is for use in infants older than 4 months, children and patients unable to swallow hard capsules, and patients with renal impairment who require dose reduction. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Viread] is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients. The drug was first approved in the US in October 2001, followed by further approvals in the European Union, Australia, Iceland, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. The drug has been launched in all these countries. In February 2003, the EMEA's advisory committee adopted a positive opinion to extend the indication of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all 15 member states to include the product's use in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. In July 2003, Japan Tobacco signed an agreement with Gilead for the commercialisation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and the future co-formulation of these two drugs within Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, Japan Tobacco will be submitting an application to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for regulatory approval of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. On 15 March 2004, Gilead announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US FDA and a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EMEA for marketing approval of the fixed-dose co-formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The MAA will be reviewed under the centralised procedure, which, when finalised, will provide one marketing authorisation in all 25 member states of the enlarged European Union. Gilead anticipates launching the combination pill on the US market early in 2005. Regulatory filings for marketing approval in Japan by Japan Tobacco are also expected during 2004. In August 2003, Gilead announced that enrollment had begun in a 48-week phase III study (Study 934) evaluating the efficacy of a once-daily regimen of Viread and Emtriva versus Combivir. The open-label, multicentre trial will enroll up to 500 treatment-naive, HIV-infected patients in the US and Europe. Patients in one arm will receive Viread 300 mg, Emtriva 200mg and efavirenz 600 mg once daily. Patients in the comparator arm will receive Combivir) (lamivudine 150 mg/zidovudine 300 mg) twice daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily."
5937,0.002,2.0000,"The ability of HIV to establish a latent infection causes life-long virus persistence, even after long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The role that latency is playing in preventing clearance of the virus infection has become evident in recent years. Patients who have been successfully treated with ART, having undetectable levels of viral RNA (below 50 copies/ml) in the plasma for years, experienced rapid virus rebound on withdrawal of therapy. Activation of latent proviruses from the infected cells in combination with ART is a therapeutic strategy that may lead to the complete elimination of HIV infection. We report here that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), can activate an HIV-1 vector provirus in a cell model system. Treatment of cells harboring a latent, HIV-1-derived provirus caused activation of both early and late viral gene expression, acetylation of nucleosome on the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), and remodeling of the chromatin at the 5' LTR. Several compounds, including valproic acid, have been tested for their ability to activate latent HIV-1, but have met with disappointing results. SAHA, a relatively nontoxic, FDA-approved compound, should be considered for developing a strategy to eliminate HIV from patients."
6966,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) expresses two structural forms of the nucleoprotein, the intracellular nucleocapsid (hepatitis core antigen [HBcAg]) and the secreted nonparticulate form (hepatitis e antigen [HBeAg]). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."
6640,0.002,2.0000,"The oligomeric nature of the viral envelope proteins has been partly held responsible for the observed differences in neutralization sensitivity between primary and laboratory-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, recent evidence suggests that host factors can also modify the sensitivity of HIV-1 particles to neutralization. Having previously demonstrated that the acquisition of host-encoded intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 proteins by newly formed viruses has a functional significance for the life cycle of HIV-1, we investigated whether the acquisition of host-derived ICAM-1 by HIV-1 could affect the virus sensitivity to neutralization. In this study, we have first shown that the physical presence of host cell membrane ICAM-1 on HIV-1 was not modifying virus sensitivity to neutralization by either two different anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (0.5beta and 4.8D) or soluble CD4. However, the ability of the F105 anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody (specific for the CD4-binding site) to neutralize ICAM-1-bearing virions was diminished when target cells were pretreated with an lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-activating antibody. Interestingly, ICAM-1/POS progeny viruses were found to be slightly more resistant to neutralization by individual human sera in target cells expressing a low-affinity form of LFA-1 than viruses devoid of host-encoded ICAM-1 proteins. This resistance was markedly enhanced when target cells expressed an activated LFA-1 form on their surface. These results suggest that the interaction between virally embedded host ICAM-1 and target cell surface LFA-1 should be considered a factor modulating neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 by human sera from HIV-1-infected individuals."
2722,0.002,2.0000,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
8817,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) readily sets up a persistent infection and is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. Interferon alfa and ribavirin therapy lead to sustained clearance of virus in 31% to 64% of patients with type 1 and non-type 1 genotypes, respectively. It is not clear to what extent these drugs act directly to reduce HCV replication, or indirectly via host immune responses, and what evoked immune responses are associated with clinical outcome. We have examined prospectively 15 patients with chronic HCV infection before, during, and after combination therapy. Quantitative assays for HCV antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and flow cytometric assays for analysis of the phenotype of T cells, in addition to viral sequencing of core protein, were performed throughout the treatment and follow-up period over 18 months. We found enhancement of proliferative T-cell responses during therapy. Proliferative responses are strikingly heterogeneous in terms of specificity, kinetics, and magnitude. Proliferative responses are often not associated with interferon-gamma release. T-cell responses are rarely sustained irrespective of treatment outcome and this is not due to the evolution of new immune escape variants. T-cell responses tend to peak late in the course of treatment. In conclusion, combination therapy for HCV has a transient effect on host virus-specific T cells in the blood. Induction of sustained T-cell responses may require additional immune modulation later in therapy."
6585,0.002,2.0000,"To determine the factors associated with pneumococcal disease (pneumococcal pneumonia or invasive disease) and the impact of pneumococcal vaccine in HIV-infected persons, we analyzed patient data collected by the Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Project for person-time between January 1990 and December 1998. Among 39,086 persons with 71,116 person-years (py) of observation, 585 episodes of pneumococcal disease were diagnosed (incidence, 8.2 episodes per 1000 py). Factors associated with an increased risk for pneumococcal disease (P < .05) included injection drug use (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.5) and blood transfusion (RR, 2.0) as the mode of HIV transmission (referent, male-male sex); black race/ethnicity (RR, 1.5; referent, white race); history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic illness (RR, 2.1); a CD4(+) cell count of 200-499 cells/microL (RR, 2.5) or < 200 cells/microL (RR, 3.7; referent, CD4(+) cell count of > or = 500 cells/microL); and alcoholism (RR, 2.0). Factors associated with a decreased risk included prescription of antiretroviral therapy (RR for monotherapy, 0.6; for dual therapy, 0.7; for triple therapy, 0.5) and pneumococcal vaccination (RR for persons vaccinated at a CD4(+) cell count of > or = 500 cells/microL, 0.5). We recommend that pneumococcal vaccine be given to HIV-infected persons before profound immunosuppression has occurred."
2782,0.002,2.0000,"The association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia is well established, but the role of HCV in B-cell lymphoma remains controversial. In patients with HCV infection, B-cell clonal expansions have been detected in peripheral blood and bone marrow, and a high prevalence of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has been documented. Liver biopsies in chronic HCV infection frequently show portal lymphoid infiltrates with features of B follicles, whose clonality has not yet been investigated. The object of this study was to determine the frequency of liver-infiltrating monoclonal B-cells in 40 patients with HCV infection."
8160,0.002,2.0000,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a mammalian host restriction factor that inhibits the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including retroviruses, alphaviruses and filoviruses, through interaction with the ZAP-responsive elements (ZRE) in viral RNA, and recruiting the exosome to degrade RNA substrate. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pararetrovirus that replicates its genomic DNA via reverse transcription of a viral pregenomic (pg) RNA precursor. Here, we demonstrate that the two isoforms of human ZAP (hZAP-L and -S) inhibit HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cells through posttranscriptional down-regulation of viral pgRNA. Mechanistically, the zinc finger motif-containing N-terminus of hZAP is responsible for the reduction of HBV RNA, and the integrity of the four zinc finger motifs is essential for ZAP to bind to HBV RNA and fulfill its antiviral function. The ZRE sequences conferring the susceptibility of viral RNA to ZAP-mediated RNA decay were mapped to the terminal redundant region (nt 1820-1918) of HBV pgRNA. In agreement with its role as a host restriction factor and as an innate immune mediator for HBV infection, ZAP was upregulated in cultured primary human hepatocytes and hepatocyte-derived cells upon IFN-α treatment or IPS-1 activation, and in the livers of hepatitis B patients during immune active phase. Knock down of ZAP expression increased the level of HBV RNA and partially attenuated the antiviral effect elicited by IPS-1 in cell cultures. In summary, we demonstrated that ZAP is an intrinsic host antiviral factor with activity against HBV through down-regulation of viral RNA, and that ZAP plays a role in the innate control of HBV replication. Our findings thus shed light on virus-host interaction, viral pathogenesis, and antiviral approaches. "
6495,0.002,2.0000,"Although myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are well known for their immunosuppressive function in several pathological conditions, the role of MDSCs in hepatitis B virus infection remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the frequency and function of MDSCs in the peripheral blood and liver of 91 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. A higher percentage of MDSCs, defined as CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low), was detected in peripheral blood of CHB patients than that of the healthy controls. Moreover, high expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and secretion of IL-10 in this population were determined. The frequency of MDSCs was positively correlated with serum viral load, but it was negatively correlated with liver inflammatory injury. These cells were also abundant in liver tissue of CHB patients and were related to necroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, we found that these cells could suppress hepatitis B virus-specific CD8(+) T cell response, including reduced proliferation and IFN-γ production, and inhibit degranulation of CD8(+) T cells, including reduced production of granzyme B and perforin. Importantly, PD-1-induced IL-10 production by MDSCs was responsible for the suppressive activity. To our knowledge, for the first time our study proved that CD14(+)HLA-DR(-/low)PD-1(+) MDSCs in CHB patients contribute to an inadequate immune response against the virus and lead to chronic infection, which represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

2007,0.002,2.0000,"Neutropenia occurs in approximately 17% of symptomatic patients infected with HIV. Results of studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent relationship between HIV-related neutropenia and the subsequent development of bacterial infections. This was a case control study to determine if HIV-related neutropenia was associated with increased rates of bacteremia. The experimental group was comprised of 29 patients infected with HIV that had an absolute neutrophil count less than 1000 cells/mm3 and were paired with 29 control subjects infected with HIV that had been matched for age, sex, CD4 count, and month and year of entry. The frequency of bacteremia was 12.6 per 100 patient months among the experimental group compared to a frequency of 0.87 per 100 patient months among the control group (relative risk [RR] = 14.9, P = 0.0027). Other independent risks for the development of bacteremia included central venous catheters (RR = 3.9, P = 0.03), with a trend toward increased risk for bacteremia in those patients who were intravenous drug users (RR = 3.8, P = 0.11), or who had infiltrative bone marrow disease (RR = 3.1, P = 0.11). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that neutropenia (odds ratio [OR] = 22.6, P = 0.028) and the presence of a central venous catheter (OR = 8.5, P = 0.026) were significant risks for bacteremia. These data suggest that neutropenia is a significant risk for the development of bacteremia in patients infected with HIV."
881,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are contagious liver diseases caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. In particular, chronic infection with HBV or HCV is a major public health problem throughout Europe. The majority of persons chronically infected (65%-75%) are not aware of their infection status until symptoms of advanced liver disease appear. In addition, the peak in the number of patients suffering from advanced stages of the disease, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, has not yet been reached. In order to reduce the current and future morbidity and mortality associated with chronic HBV or HCV infection, the timely detection of chronically infected persons, with follow-up and case management, is crucial. However, the current screening strategies in Europe and Switzerland have to be considered as inadequate to detect the majority of chronically infected persons. Hence, we emphasise the importance of an alternative approach: the healthcare provider initiated identification of HBV or HCV infection in defined risk groups. This entails determining whether a person is not only at risk of being chronically infected, but also at risk of becoming infected with HBV or HCV and, if necessary, testing for HBV or HCV infection."
4407,0.002,2.0000,"To study the pattern of transmission of HBV in a large urban community, an in-depth prospective study was performed in Hamburg between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. In total, 524 patients were classified as hepatitis B cases according to the case definition of the Robert Koch Institute, comprising 197 foreign-born and 327 German-born persons. The principal risk factor was parenteral drug use, with 17.7% (n=93/524) of all documented cases of hepatitis B, followed by immigration as refugees (13.9%; n=73). Of all 524 cases, 72 (13.7%) were associated with heterosexual (n=41) or homosexual (n=31) transmission. Household contacts of HBV carriers or of patients with acute infectious disease contributed to 9.0% of the cases (n=47). Medical procedures were most probably the source in 7.4% (n=39), although only 3.2% (n=17) of all patients were health-care workers. In multivariate analysis of household contacts, male-male sexual activity was found to be the greatest risk factor for acquiring an acute HBV infection, followed by asylum-seeking status and the number of contacts. The incidence was 3.5-fold higher among foreign-born persons (16.1 per 100,000) than among German-born individuals (4.5 per 100,000) suggesting that a targeted intervention in this population group is a public-health need. The current national policy of vaccination in defined age groups should be extended to the immunization of all children of foreign-born parents as well as the screening and immunisation of susceptible foreign-born adults."
9016,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences obtained during antiretroviral resistance testing with a commercial genotyping assay (Tru Gene; Bayer Corp.) were analyzed to assess the utility of these data for detecting and characterizing non-subtype-B HIV-1 strains. A total of 125 viral sequences obtained from patients believed to have acquired their HIV-1 infection in Africa were analyzed, of which 121 were determined to belong to non-B subtypes. Utilizing Tru Gene sequence data alone, 92 (76%) of these viruses could be subtyped by conventional phylogenetic analysis. The addition of supplemental RT sequence data enabled a further 28 (23.1%) viruses to be classified, while one (0.9%) sample could not be classified conclusively. Two internet-accessible databases that generate HIV-1 subtypes from PR and RT sequences (HIV-SEQ and Geno 2 Pheno) were also evaluated, and both achieved 88% concordance (106/120) with phylogenetic analysis. Non-subtype-B and B-subtype HIV-1 sequences could be readily discriminated by tallying silent polymorphisms listed on the Tru Gene research report. The mean number of silent polymorphisms in the non-B HIV-1 sequences identified in this study was 58.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1 to 75.5), compared with 20.7 (95% CI, 9.9 to 31.5) for the four subtype B viruses in the study cohort and 118 case-matched B-subtype controls. Sequence data generated in the Tru Gene HIV-1 genotyping assay could, therefore, provide a ready means of tracking the prevalence and identity of non-B subtypes in HIV-1-infected populations undergoing routine antiretroviral resistance testing."
5665,0.002,2.0000,"Since the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), solid organ transplantation (SOT) has become a therapeutic option for the HIV-positive population. In contrast with liver and kidney transplantation, only three simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (SPKT) have been reported among HIV-infected patients. Herein we have reported the first SPKT in an HIV-infected patient in Spain. The pancreas graft failed at 2 weeks and the patient died at 9 months because of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The three recipients reported in the literature lived, despite the failure of both the pancreas and kidney grafts in one subject. Despite the poor outcome of our case, HIV-1 infection was controlled after transplantation (stable CD4(+) cells and no AIDS-related events), and the kidney graft functioned with no episodes of rejection. The cART regimen used in the pretransplant period was switched at the time of transplantation to raltegravir and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Raltegravir has no interactions with immunosuppressive drugs. Target plasma levels of tacrolimus were achieved at a dose similar to that used in HIV-negative transplant recipients. The most adequate antiretroviral regimen for HIV-infected SOT recipients has not yet been established; however, one may consider switching protease inhibitors or non-NRTI-based regimens for a raltegravir-based regimen at the time of transplantation."

It is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV is known to have a negative impact on the natural disease outcome and immune response of HCV infection, whereas the reverse remains unclear.

1493,0.002,2.0000,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.

5936,0.002,2.0000,"Interleukin (IL)-21 has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in controlling chronic viral infections. However, little is known about the regulatory role of IL-21 in T cell immunity during the process of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In the present study, the levels of serum IL-21 in 77 patients with various degrees of CHB in immune clearance phase (IC), 25 patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in immune tolerance phase (IT), and 25 healthy controls (HC) were measured and their potential association with major clinic indexes was examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CHB patients were stimulated with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in the presence or absence of anti-IL-21 antibody or recombinant IL-21, and the frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) and interferon (IFN)-γ(+)CD8(+) T cells was characterized by flow cytometry. Our data indicated that the levels of serum IL-21 were significantly higher in the IC CHB patients than that in the other groups and were positively correlated with the levels of serum HBV DNA and HBeAg in the IC patients. There was a low frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) T cells in IC CHB patients. Further, IL-21 enhanced HBcAg-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell proliferation, while treatment with anti-IL-21 inhibited antigen-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell expansion in vitro. Our findings imply that IL-21 positively regulates proinflammatory IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell responses during the process of chronic HBV infection in humans. "
32,0.002,2.0000,"In the absence of a protective vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there is an urgent need for the development of effective topical microbicides to prevent HIV infection. Candidate vaginal microbicides should provide protection against circulating strains, be cheap, stable on storage, safe and easy to use. Here we describe a detailed study of the safety and efficacy of Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) in vitro, and in an ex vivo model of female genital tissue explants. CV-N demonstrated potent activity in the low nanomolar range against laboratory and primary isolates. Activity was related to the affinity of CV-N for binding to whole virions as determined by acoustic resonance. Potent activity was also observed against cell-associated HIV-1, although slightly reduced. CV-N activity in the presence of whole semen was reduced by 7-10-fold, although it remained in the low nanomolar range and was minimally modified by the presence of Candida albicans. Furthermore, CV-N potently inhibited infection of ectocervical explants and virus dissemination by tissue-emigrating cells. In peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assays, CV-N was shown to have some mitogenic activity following 3 days exposure to compound, and this was associated with a modest increase in expression of gamma interferon, stromal cell-derived factor 1beta and interleukin 4. However, 2 h exposure to CV-N had no effect on cytokine expression in PBMC or tissue explant culture over a 24 h period, suggesting that the potential for inflammation is low. Data presented here indicate that targeting HIV envelope glycoproteins may provide an effective strategy to prevent HIV-1 infection mediated by either cell-free virus or infected cells."
9228,0.002,2.0000,"Concomitant infection with TT virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common. However, the effect of TTV infection on chronic hepatitis B or C is unknown. The prevalence of TTV infection, the effect of TTV infection on the clinical, histological and virological features of patients with chronic hepatitis B or C, and the influence of TTV infection on the HCV response to interferon alfa therapy were studied. A total of 100 asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen carriers, 220 patients with HBV-related chronic liver diseases, and 110 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa (3 million units subcutaneously three times a week for 24 weeks) were enrolled. Serum HCV RNA and serum TTV DNA were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum HBV DNA and serum HCV RNA level were quantified by branched DNA assays. Infection with TTV was detected in 21.5% of HBV carriers and 37% of HCV carriers. TTV infection had little effect on the clinicopathological course of chronic HBV infection. In chronic hepatitis C, clinical features, histological severity, serum HCV RNA levels, and the response to interferon alfa therapy did not differ between those with and without TTV infection. The loss of serum TTV DNA did not correlate with the biochemical response as did in the loss of serum HCV RNA. In conclusion, TTV infection is found frequently in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C in Taiwan; however, coinfection with TTV does not affect the clinicopathological course of chronic hepatitis B or C and the response to interferon alfa therapy."
3717,0.002,2.0000,"After responding to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected children had a good response to hepatitis B immunization. However, there are limited data on the durability of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) in these children. The primary objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of protective anti-HBs level 3 years after a 3-dose HBV revaccination among HIV-infected children with immune recovery (CD4 cell ≥ 15%) while on HAART. The secondary objective is to assess immunologic memory among children who had waning of anti-HBs. An anti-HBs level of ≥ 10 mIU/mL was defined as a protective antibody level. Sixty-nine HIV-infected children who had history of a 3-dose HBV revaccination while receiving HAART were enrolled. The mean (SD) of CD4 cell and duration of HAART at time of revaccination was 27.2% (6.7) and 5.9 years (0.4), respectively. The proportion of children with protective anti-HBs level 3 years after the revaccination was 71.0% [95% CI, 58.8-81.3]. The geometric mean titer was 114(SD 5)IU/mL. By multivariate logistic analysis, the predictors for protective anti-HBs level 3 years after revaccination were CD4 cell count ≥ 500 cells/mm³ at the time of vaccination (p = 0.04) and anti-HBs level ≥ 100 IU/mL at 1 month after completion of the 3-dose vaccination (p < 0.001). Anamnestic response after one booster dose was demonstrated among 14 of 17 children who had waning protective anti-HBs level (82.4% [95% CI, 62.2-102.6]). Our findings support the recommendation of giving a 3-dose HBV vaccination to HIV-infected children with immune recovery while receiving HAART."
1263,0.002,2.0000,"Many viruses modulate calcium (Ca2+) signaling to create a cellular environment that is more permissive to viral replication, but for most viruses that regulate Ca2+ signaling, the mechanism underlying this regulation is not well understood. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) HBx protein modulates cytosolic Ca2+ levels to stimulate HBV replication in some liver cell lines. A chronic HBV infection is associated with life-threatening liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and HBx modulation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels could have an important role in HBV pathogenesis. Whether HBx affects cytosolic Ca2+ in a normal hepatocyte, the natural site of an HBV infection, has not been addressed. Here, we report that HBx alters cytosolic Ca2+ signaling in cultured primary hepatocytes. We used single cell Ca2+ imaging of cultured primary rat hepatocytes to demonstrate that HBx elevates the cytosolic Ca2+ level in hepatocytes following an IP3-linked Ca2+ response; HBx effects were similar when expressed alone or in the context of replicating HBV. HBx elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ level required extracellular Ca2+ influx and store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) entry and stimulated HBV replication in hepatocytes. We used both targeted RT-qPCR and transcriptome-wide RNAseq analyses to compare levels of SOC channel components and other Ca2+ signaling regulators in HBV-expressing and control hepatocytes and show that the transcript levels of these various proteins are not affected by HBV. We also show that HBx regulation of SOC-regulated Ca2+ accumulation is likely the consequence of HBV modulation of a SOC channel regulatory mechanism. In support of this, we link HBx enhancement of SOC-regulated Ca2+ accumulation to Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria and demonstrate that HBx stimulates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in primary hepatocytes. The results of our study may provide insights into viral mechanisms that affect Ca2+ signaling to regulate viral replication and virus-associated diseases."
5943,0.002,2.0000,"Thirty patients with AIDS-related complex/Walter-Reed 5 enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blind study with high-dose intravenous gammaglobulin administration were tested by quantitating HIV Western blot and other serological tests for viral antibodies. Furthermore, conventional virus isolation attempts were performed. Absence or loss of p24 antibodies during the study period was associated with progression to AIDS (p = 0.01) and thereby was an earlier prognostic parameter of a poor prognosis than T4 cell count. Neither changes in antibody patterns against other HIV polypeptides, HIV titers in the immunofluorescence test nor demonstration of HIV antigen were significantly associated with progression to AIDS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) could be isolated from two duodenal biopsies of a patient who developed AIDS at the same time, but a concomitant serological diagnosis of CMV infection was not successful. Though signs in the serology of human herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, CMV, Epstein-Barr virus), possibly indicating a reactivation of latent infections, could be observed in some instances, a correlation with clinical symptoms or the clinical outcome was not feasible, perhaps also because of a poor standardization of some of the test kits used. All patients were positive for IgG antibodies against the three herpesviruses when entering the study. High prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was found (83% anti-HBc positive), only 1 patient being chronically infected and highly infectious, as shown by HBV-DNA hybridization. No significant difference between treatment and placebo group was observed with the parameters tested in this study."
2754,0.002,2.0000,"Population genotyping (PG) can underestimate resistance if resistance-containing low abundance variants go undetected. PG and clonal analysis (CA) results were compared in virologic failures (VFs) from a 48-week clinical trial that evaluated once-daily fosamprenavir/ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400 mg/100 mg or atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) 300 mg/100 mg, each combined with tenofovir/emtricitabine, in antiretroviral-naive patients. VF was defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA > or =400 copies/ml at > or =24 weeks or viral rebound >400 copies/ml any time following viral suppression. All patients had baseline PG. One hundred and six patients enrolled (53/arm). Baseline resistance mutations were more prevalent in patients receiving FPV/r (10/53) than ATV/r (3/53). Seven patients (7%) were VFs-four on FPV/r and three on ATV/r. In the four FPV/r-treated VFs, baseline HIV TAMs combinations and/or PI mutations were detected in one by PG at VF (RT: L210W + T215C; PR: M46I + L76V) and three others by CA alone (RT: L210W + T215Y; RT: M41L; RT: K65R + K70R; PR: I47V); all four had study drug-associated mutations (CA detecting more HIV-1 resistance mutations than PG). In the three ATV/r VFs, no baseline drug-associated mutations were detected by PG; for one patient CA detected RT: K65R; PR: I84V. Phylogenetic analysis revealed tight clustering for FPV/r-treated VFs with highly related clones, whereas HIV-1 from ATV/r-treated VFs had no outgrowth from baseline of low abundance resistance-containing variants. In conclusion, low-abundance HIV resistance-containing variants were detected in baseline samples from patients with VF. The archived viruses that reemerged under selection pressure and acquired additional mutations were found primarily in patients in the FPV/r arm. Despite this and a baseline resistance imbalance between the two arms, FPV/r and ATV/r provided similar virologic suppression through 48 weeks; however, these findings highlight the necessity for the development of quick and inexpensive methods for detection of minority species to better guide therapy selection."
7995,0.002,2.0000,"The first use of lentiviral vectors in humans involved transduction of mature T-cells with an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived env antisense (envAS) vector to protect cells from HIV infection. In that study, only a minority of the patient T-cell population could be gene-modified, raising the question of whether the altered cells could affect replicating HIV populations. We investigated this using humanized NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (hNSG) mice reconstituted with approximately 4-11% envAS-modified human T-cells. Mice were challenged with HIV-1(NL4-3), which has an env perfectly complementary to envAS, or with HIV-1(BaL), which has a divergent env. No differences were seen in viral titer between mice that received envAS-modified cells and control mice that did not. Using 454/Roche pyrosequencing, we analyzed the mutational spectrum in HIV populations in serum-from 33 mice we recovered 84,074 total reads comprising 31,290 unique sequence variants. We found enrichment of A-to-G transitions and deletions in envAS-treated mice, paralleling a previous tissue culture study where most target cells contained envAS, even though minority of cells were envAS-modified here. Unexpectedly, this enrichment was only detected after the challenge with HIV-1(BaL), where the viral genome would form an imperfect duplex with envAS, and not HIV-1(NL4-3), where a perfectly matched duplex would form."
3966,0.002,2.0000,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
3916,0.002,2.0000,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."
4468,0.002,2.0000,"The importance of CD8+ T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been demonstrated, yet few studies have been able to correlate these responses with markers of HIV-1 disease progression. This study measured cell-mediated immune responses using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 27 patients with chronic HIV-1 infection, the majority of whom were off antiretroviral therapy. The ELISPOT assay was used to detect gamma interferon-secreting PBMC after stimulation with overlapping HIV-1 peptides spanning the Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef proteins in addition to the baculovirus-derived p24 and gp160 proteins. All volunteers had responses to at least one HIV-1-specific peptide. All but one of the subjects (96%) responded to the Gag peptide pool, and 86% responded to the Pol and/or Nef peptide pools. The magnitude and the breadth of T-cell responses directed to either the Gag or p24 peptide pools correlated inversely with viral load in plasma (r = -0.60, P < 0.001 and r = -0.52, P < 0.005, respectively) and directly with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.54, P < 0.01 and r = 0.39, P < 0.05, respectively) using the Spearman rank correlation test. Responses to the Pol and integrase peptide pools also correlated with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.45, P < 0.05 and r = 0.49, P < 0.01, respectively). No correlation with markers of disease progression was seen with specific T-cell responses directed toward the Env or Nef peptides. These data serve as strong evidence that major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of Gag peptides is an essential feature for any HIV-1 vaccine designed to elicit optimal CD8+ T-cell responses."
9035,0.002,2.0000,"The changing pattern of HIV infection in the UK includes an increase in the number of infections acquired as a result of heterosexual contact and Black African individuals represent a sizeable proportion of those affected. In most UK centres for the treatment of HIV infection, clinicians have limited experience in caring for Black African patients, and there is a dearth of information about the recognition and management of mental health problems in this patient group. In this investigation the proportion of Black African individuals looked after in a large centre for the care of HIV infection in London was compared with the proportion of such patients referred for specialist mental health help, the results revealing that Black Africans were almost three times less likely to be referred for specialist mental health care. A case control investigation of those referred to mental health services showed that Black Africans were more likely to be suffering from AIDS at the time of referral, be referred for assessment of possible organic brain disease, and more likely to be found to be suffering from major depression or organic brain disease. Reasons for the lesser likelihood of referral to the mental health service are considered, including the possible failure of staff to recognize psychological morbidity in Black Africans, or reluctance and fear on the part of patients to be referred to services that may be perceived as threatening."
370,0.002,2.0000,"Infection with hepadnaviruses and exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) are considered to be major risk factors in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. A high rate of p53 mutations at codon 249 has been reported in these tumors. The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) is a useful animal model for the development of HCC after human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or AFB1 treatment. Therefore, it was of particular interest to determine whether the p53 gene in tree shrew HCCs associated with HBV infection and/or with exposure to AFB1 is affected in the same manner as in human HCCs. We determined the tree shrew p53 wild-type nucleotide sequences by RT-PCR and automatic DNA-sequencing. Tree shrew wild-type p53 sequence showed 91.7 and 93.4% homologies with human p53 nucleotide and amino acids sequences, respectively, while it showed 77.2 and 73.7% homologies in mice. One HCC and normal liver tissue from AFB1 treated and one HCC from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrew showed no change in p53 sequences, while three HCCs from AFB1- and HBV-treated tree shrews showed point mutations in p53 sequences. One HCC showed point mutations at codon 275, which is on the DNA-binding domain of p53 gene, which might be a cause of gain-of-function during the development of HCC. As a result, our finding indicates that tree shrews exposed to AFB1 and/or HBV had neither codon 249 mutations nor significant levels of other mutations in the p53 gene, as is the case with humans."
3299,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are classified as having the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a successful therapy for patients with lymphoma who have a poor prognosis. Combined therapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and the antiviral drug zidovudine has the potential advantage of protecting the new donor hematopoietic-lymphoid and monocyte-macrophage cells from HIV-1 infection. A 41-year-old man infected with HIV-1 who had lymphoma was treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Before transplantation he received high-dose zidovudine for 2 weeks (5 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours) and after transplantation he received a lower maintenance dose (1.33 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours). No untoward toxicities attributable to zidovudine were observed. Bone marrow engraftment occurred on day 17. Chromosome and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses demonstrated complete chimerism. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow samples were negative for HIV-1 by culture and polymerase chain reaction gene amplification 32 days after transplantation. The patient died 47 days after transplantation because of tumor relapse. Analysis of autopsy tissue showed no evidence of HIV-1 by either culture (brain, bone marrow, lymph node, and tumor specimens) or by polymerase chain reaction gene amplification for HIV-1 RNA and DNA sequences (brain, bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver, lung, rectosigmoid, spleen, and tumor specimens). Immunologic monitoring showed loss of HIV-1 antibody. Adoptive immunologic transfer was shown to be present to both tetanus and diphtheria antigens. Our case suggests that the HIV-1-infected recipient cells may have been eradicated secondary to the bone marrow ablative chemo-radiotherapy and that zidovudine may be able to prevent the establishment of HIV-1 infection in donor hematopoietic-lymphoid cells."
1741,0.002,2.0000,"Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha-1; Talpha1) is a 28-amino acid polypeptide that has shown efficacy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term, dose-related efficacy and safety of Talpha1 treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients with positive HBV-DNA and abnormally high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. A total of 316 patients were randomized to receive either 0.8 or 1.6 mg of Talpha1 monotherapy for 24 weeks. At the end of the 72-week observation period (12 months after cessation of therapy), 36.4% of patients in the 1.6-mg treatment group achieved normalization of ALT, 30% achieved clearance of HBV-DNA by branched DNA vs 15% by transcription-mediated amplification, and 22.8% achieved clearance of HBe-antigen. Patients in the 0.8-mg treatment group achieved similar efficacy rates, although patients with advanced fibrosis demonstrated a significantly better response rate when treated with 1.6 mg of Talpha1 monotherapy vs 0.8 mg (as determined by intragroup analysis; patients were not stratified by liver biopsy). All adverse drug reactions were mild and most involved the fluctuation of liver enzymes, which was most likely related to the positive immune effects caused by the response to Talpha1 treatment. Adverse event incidence was similar in the 1.6- and 0.8-mg treatment groups. In conclusion, Talpha1 at doses of 0.8 and 1.6 mg exhibits long-term efficacy against hepatitis B with a good safety profile."
6184,0.002,2.0000,"For cancer patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, HBV reactivation is a well-described complication, which may result in varying degrees of liver damage. Several clinical features and the pre-chemotherapy HBV viral load have been suggested to be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition: (1). to assess the clinical and virological factors in a comprehensive manner and thereby identify those that are associated with the development of HBV reactivation; (2). to develop a predictive model to quantify the risk of HBV reactivation. In all, 138 consecutive cancer patients who were HBV carriers and undergoing chemotherapy were studied, of which 128 patients had sera available for real-time PCR HBV DNA measurement. They were followed up throughout their course of chemotherapy and the HBV reactivation rate was determined. The clinical and virological features between those who did and did not develop viral reactivation were compared. These included age, sex, baseline liver function tests, HBeAg status and viral load (HBV DNA) prior to the chemotherapy, and the use of specific cytotoxic agents. In all, 36 (26%) developed HBV reactivation. Multivariate analysis revealed pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA level, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer to be significant factors. Based on real-time HBV DNA PCR assay, detectable baseline HBV DNA prior to the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer are predictive factors for the development of HBV reactivation. A predictive model was developed from the current data, based on a logistic regression method."
2746,0.002,2.0000,"The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was determined in 564 patients and 145 staff members of nine hemodialysis (HD) units in Nagano Prefecture using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the C 100 HCV antigen (the first generation anti-HCV assay). And also serum HBV markers were tested in these subjects. One hundred patients (18%) were anti-C100 HCV positive, indicating that this figure represents a much higher prevalence than that (0.9%) among general population in the same geographical area. Out of 141 patients without history of blood transfusion, 17 (12%) were positive for anti-C 100 HCV, suggesting that blood-transfusions-unrelated acquisition of HCV infection can occur. Anti-HCV prevalence correlated with both the blood units transfused and the duration of HD treatment. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of anti-C 100 HCV in individual dialysis units ranging from 0% to 53%. In the dialysis unit with prevalence of 53%, approximately half of the anti-HCV positive patients were found to have chronic liver disease. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers among HD patients, on the other hand, was 36% (202/564). Fifty one (51%) of 100 anti-C 100 HCV positive patients and 151 (33%) of 464 anti-C 100 HCV negative patients were positive for HBV markers, with significant difference in HBV infection rate between the 2 groups. The prevalence of chronic liver disease, defined as abnormal serum transaminase levels for more than 6 months was significantly higher in anti-HCV positive patients than in anti-HCV negative ones (39% vs 10%, p less than 0.05), suggesting that HCV infection may contribute to chronic liver disease in HD patients. Among 145 staff members, only 3 (2%) were positive for anti-HCV, whereas 25 (17%) were positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), indicating prior HBV infection. With applying the second generation anti-HCV assay, which can detect antibodies to both capsid and nonstructural products of HCV gene, anti-HCV prevalence increased by two times in HD patients, but didn't change in HD staff members.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
1950,0.002,2.0000,"The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons has extended significantly since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies. Although classical opportunistic infections are now rarely seen, the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs as well as liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses represent an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive persons. Since the rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high among HIV carriers (up to 75% among intravenous drug users), HCV/HIV coinfection is widely prevalent. Predisposing liver damage favors a higher rate of hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs, which can limit the benefit of HIV treatment in some individuals. Overall, severe hepatotoxicity appears in around 10% of subjects who began triple combinations including either protease inhibitors or non-nucleosides. The progression to cirrhosis seems to occur faster in the setting of HIV infection, and conversely recent data demonstrate that HCV infection can accelerate the progression to AIDS in HIV-positive persons. Although clinicians have been reluctant to treat hepatitis C in HIV-infected people, this therapeutic nihilism is unwarranted. The availability of new more successful regimens to treat hepatitis C, in particular using the new pegylated forms of interferon in combination with ribavirin, open new hopes for the care of HIV-HCV-coinfected persons."
4973,0.002,2.0000,"The introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection has significantly improved the life expectancy of HIV positive patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common in HIV infected patients and is now a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Optimal management and treatment of HCV in HIV infected patients is therefore essential. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin is the mainstay of treatment for HCV infection in HIV infected people. The sustained virological response rate (SVR) with combination therapy is lower than that commonly observed in HCV mono-infected patients. This is, at least in part, due to the very high treatment drop out rates. Ribavirin in combination with HAART is associated with particular side effects such as mitochondrial toxicity. Therefore, vigilant monitoring of patients during therapy, in specialist centers is essential. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin is particularly promising as it is easier to administer and will probably become the treatment of choice for co-infected patients. A SVR is associated with genotype 2 and 3, in addition to a high CD4+ cell count and a low HCV load prior to therapy. The progression of HCV related liver disease in HIV positive patients is faster than in subjects with HCV infection alone. As a result, there is an increasing incidence of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease in co-infected patients. Liver transplantation is being evaluated in many centers. To date the experiences are very limited but encouraging in term of survival rate."
2161,0.002,2.0000,"Continual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution and expansion within the human population have led to unequal distribution of HIV-1 group M subtypes. In particular, recent outgrowth of subtype C in southern Africa, India, and China has fueled speculation that subtype C isolates may be more fit in vivo. In this study, nine subtype B and six subtype C HIV-1 isolates were added to peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures for a complete pairwise competition experiment. All subtype C HIV-1 isolates were less fit than subtype B isolates (P < 0.0001), but intrasubtype variations in HIV-1 fitness were not significant. Increased fitness of subtype B over subtype C was also observed in primary CD4(+) T cells and macrophages from different human donors but not in skin-derived human Langerhans cells. Detailed analysis of the retroviral life cycle during several B and C virus competitions indicated that the efficiency of host cell entry may have a significant impact on relative fitness. Furthermore, phyletic analyses of fitness differences suggested that, for a recombined subtype B/C HIV-1 isolate, higher fitness mapped to the subtype B env gene rather than the subtype C gag and pol genes. These results suggest that subtype B and C HIV-1 may be transmitted with equal efficiency (Langerhans cell data) but that subtype C isolates may be less fit following initial infection (T-cell and macrophage data) and may lead to slower disease progression."
4517,0.002,2.0000,"Prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation after AIDS diagnosis, in the absence of certain opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, delays disease progression and death, but system barriers to inpatient ART initiation at large hospitals in the era of modern ART have been less studied. We reviewed hospitalizations for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in 2011 and 2012. Individual- and system-level variables were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for ART initiation prior to discharge. With Georgia Department of Health surveillance data, we estimated time to first clinic visit, ART initiation, and viral suppression. In the study population (n = 81), ART was initiated prior to discharge in 10 (12%) patients. Shorter hospital stay was significantly associated with lack of ART initiation at the time of HIV diagnosis (8 versus 24 days, OR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.25). Reducing barriers to ART initiation for newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients with short hospital stays may improve time to viral suppression."
2896,0.002,2.0000,"The implementation of hepatitis C (HCV) direct-acting antiviral drugs is prioritized in several populations in which its application provides the most immediate and impactful benefit. In this scenario, a precise knowledge of the situation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV chronic co-infection is required to adequately address this disease. This cross-sectional study was performed in 21 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients with an active HCV chronic infection who were not receiving HCV treatment at the time of inclusion. A total of 13,506 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Of them, 2561 (18.9 %) presented chronic HCV infection. The majority of the patients included were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 96.2 %), showed plasma levels with an undetectable HIV viral load (92.5 %), and had a good immunological status (median CD4+ cell count of 486 cells/mL). The HCV genotype distribution was as follows: 58.1 % were genotype 1, 1.1 % were genotype 2, 16.1 % were genotype 3, and 22.1 % were genotype 4 (2.6 % were missing data). In total, 24.8 % of the patients showed liver fibrosis stage F0-F1, 27.9 % showed stage F2, 16.7 % showed stage F3, and 21 % showed stage F4 (9.6 % were missing data). With regards to previous HCV treatment experiences, 68.05 % of the patients were naïve and 31.95 % had failed to respond to a previous treatment. The burden of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in our population was reported as one in five HIV-infected patients requiring HCV treatment. The implementation of extra resources to face this important health challenge is mandatory. "
6516,0.002,2.0000,"Brazilian AIDS and HIV-1-seropositive patients have had free access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since November 1996. Although secondary data based on official mortality statistics indicate a sharp decrease in AIDS mortality, few if any studies tried to estimate the prognosis for patients with HIV who have been followed from the beginning of the HAART era. An observational study, with retrospective and prospective components, was done in 233 adult HIV-1-infected subjects who were recruited in the last 10 years at the outpatient sector of the Secondary Immunodeficiencies Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Hospital das Clinicas da FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The definition of AIDS followed the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1987. One hundred sixty patients were asymptomatic, 46 had AIDS, 24 had AIDS-related complex, and 3 presented with acute infection at study entry. Twenty-nine (18%) of the asymptomatic subjects developed AIDS during follow-up, with 5 (3%) deaths. Among the 46 AIDS cases at entry, 7 (17%) died during follow-up. Thus, a total of 12 people (5.2%) died of AIDS in this cohort over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years and 24 people were lost to follow-up (10.3%). Ninety percent of the survivors were on combined therapy (82% with 3 or more drugs, and 8% with 2 drugs), while 10% were not taking antiretrovirals. People with AIDS at entry were 5 times more likely to die during this period compared to patients who were asymptomatic at entry (p = 0.006). Women showed better outcomes than men, reflecting differences in CD4+ T-cell counts at study entry. All but 1 patient progressed to AIDS during the pre-HAART era (before 1996). In spite of its recent decline, mortality from AIDS-related conditions remains an important public health issue."
3529,0.002,2.0000,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."
9892,0.002,2.0000,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with different genotypes and subgenotypes differ in response to treatment and long-term prognosis. The differences emerge from variability within the genomes that leads to structural deviations at the pregenomic level and to changes at the translational level. Naturally occurring HBV strains covering the four major genotypes A-D were obtained from 393 patients and part of the genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and analyzed for mutational differences in the precore and core promoter regions. The study confirmed that core promoter and precore mutations occur at key positions (A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A), and that the proportions of strains with seroconvertion in patients differ between the four HBV genotypes. A rare double mutation (C1857T together with G1897A) was observed, and C1856T was found together with the emerging G1898A mutation, which itself was found to be more widespread geographically than previously described. We found a novel mutation (T1850C), never before observed in human HBV strains but known from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A novel association of mutation C1773T with G1764T, C1766A, and G1757A was also found within a site already suggested to be a putative binding site for HNF-3. This novel association is proposed by us to be of importance for additional binding of HNH-2 to this site and is a better indicator of the emergence of the double mutation G1764T and C1766A than the G1757A mutation proposed previously."
9585,0.002,2.0000,"Approximately 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), representing a significant public health challenge. Nucleos/tide analogues (NUCs) and interferon alpha (IFNα), the current standard of care for chronic infection, aim at preventing progression of the disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. However, in contrast to the case of hepatitis C virus infection, in which novel antiviral drugs cure the vast majority of treated patients, in regard to HBV, cure is rare due to the unusual persistence of viral DNA in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of infected cells. Available therapies for HBV require lifelong treatment and surveillance, as reactivation frequently occurs following medication cessation and the occurrence of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, even after years of successful viral suppression. Progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics, and it is likely that only a combination of immune modulators, inhibitors of gene expression and replication and cccDNA-targeting drugs will eradicate chronic infection. This review aims to summarize the state of the art in HBV drug research highlighting those agents with the greatest potential for success based on in vitro as well as on data from clinical studies."
9606,0.002,2.0000,"Of all the hepatotropic viruses, HBV is associated with the greatest worldwide morbidity and mortality. This is because of the ease of transmission and the potential for progression to a chronic infective carrier state, with the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of PCR has shown that some of the earlier concepts concerning the interpretation of serological data were inaccurate. Many patients with anti-HBe and anti-HBs have viral DNA detectable by PCR, and some hepatocellular carcinoma patients have detectable HBV DNA in their livers in the absence of all serological markers of HBV disease. The clearance of HBV infected cells from the liver is dependent on the interplay between the interferon system and the cellular limb of the host immune response. The importance of the nucleocapsid proteins as targets for sensitized cytotoxic T cells has been established for chronic HBV infection. The importance of pre-S sequences as inducers and targets of the virus-neutralizing humoral immune response is becoming established, but their precise role must await the development of in vitro models of hepadnavirus infection and a greater understanding of the mechanisms of viral uptake. The epidemiology and clinical course of the disease can be modified by immunization, immune stimulation and antiviral chemotherapy. For the developing world, a programme of immunization at birth would be the most effective way of eliminating this disease, but at present the cost is prohibitive. For the developed world, immunization is realistic for the at-risk population, and anti-viral and immunostimulatory therapy available for those already infected. In adult acquired chronic HBV infection alpha-interferon produces HBe antigen clearance in 40-60% of cases and is followed by resolution of the hepatic inflammation. Results in neonatally acquired infection are less impressive and prednisolone priming followed by interferon may be needed. The presence of a mutation in the pre-core region of some virus isolates has recently been described. Hepatocytes infected with this virus cannot produce HBe antigen and the course of the liver disease is fairly rapid. Whether this mutant causes liver damage in the same way as the wild virus or is directly cytopathic remains unclear, and its relationship to fulminant hepatitis is under investigation."
9387,0.002,2.0000,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
9004,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B infection (HBV) is prevalent worldwide. Overall prevalence is about 3 percent in Bangladesh. Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."
8382,0.002,2.0000,"This study describes and conceptualizes the experiences of stigma in a group of children living with HIV in São Paulo, Brazil, and evaluates the impact of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over the social course of AIDS and over the children's experiences of stigma. Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."
9450,0.002,2.0000,"We assessed the intralaboratory reproducibility of a system for sequencing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) by using replicate subanalyses of 46 plasma samples collected from HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-experienced patients in order to determine the relative contributions of the different procedural steps to final sequence variability. Complete sequence concordance between duplicates of each sample was 99.4%. Complete and partial mismatches occurred scattered throughout the PR-RT genome segment at >300 positions. Approximately 75% of the discordances involved mixtures, some of which appeared at key resistance sites. Most differences were the result of the first-round RT-PCR procedure. Inter-rater concordance for sequence analysis and assembly was >99.9%. There was no observed correlation between the number or frequency of mismatches and plasma viral loads. A separate longitudinal analysis of a single routine control sample sequenced 103 times over 9 months consistently gave highly reproducible sequences (median percentage of nucleotide discordances, 0.04%; range, 0 to 0.2%). Finally, sequence data from 168 sequential samples collected from 22 patients with long-term, predominantly wild type HIV showed that intrapatient nucleotide concordance with individual index sequences ranged from 96.5 to 100%. Together, these results confirm that sequence-based genotyping can be a precise and reliable tool for monitoring HIV drug resistance, and they suggest that efforts to reduce variability should focus on the first RT-PCR step. Consequently, the data suggest that the composition of external quality assessment panels should be based on clinical HIV isolates rather than DNA clones."
4243,0.002,2.0000,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is one of the most severe complications of parenteral drug abuse. The incidence of IE in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) is 2% to 5% per year, being responsible for 5% to 10% of the overall death rate. The prevalence of HIV infection among IVDAs with IE ranges between 30% and 70% in developed countries and HIV-infection by itself increases the risk of IE in IVDAs. The incidence of IE in IVDAs is currently decreasing in some areas, probably due to changes in drug administration habits by addicts to avoid HIV transmission. Overall, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common etiological agent, being usually sensitive to methicillin (MSSA). The tricuspid valve is the most frequently affected (60% to 70%), followed by the mitral and aortic valves (20% to 30%). HIV-positive IVDAs have a higher ratio of right-sided IE and S aureus IE than HIV-negative IVDAs. Response to antibiotic therapy is similar. Drug addicts with non-complicated MSSA right-sided IE can be treated with an i.v. short-course regimen of nafcillin or cloxacillin for 2 weeks, with or without addition of an aminoglycoside during the first 3 to 7 days. The prognosis of right-sided endocarditis is generally good; overall mortality is less than 5%, and with surgery is less than 2%. In contrast, the prognosis of left-sided IE is less favorable; mortality is 20% to 30%, and even with surgery is 15% to 25%. IE caused by GNB or fungi has the worst prognosis. Mortality between HIV-infected or non-HIV-infected IVDAs with IE is similar. However, among HIV-infected IVDAs, mortality is significantly higher in those who are most severely immunosuppressed, with CD4+ cell count < 200/microL or with AIDS criteria. Conversely, IE in HIV-infected patients who are not drug abusers is rare. The epidemiology of cardiac surgery in IVDAs and/or HIV-infected patients has changed in recent years. There is a decrease in IE and an increase of patients undergoing surgery (CABS) for coronary artery disease secondary to the hyperlipidemia and lipodystrophy induced by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Cardiac surgery in HIV-infected patients with or without IE does not worsen the prognosis because extracorporeal circulation did not affect the immune status after surgery. Morbidity and mortality seems to stay within the same range as the non-infected patients. In our experience, in the IE in HIV-infected IVDA group, the 1-year survival is 65% and the 5 and 10-year actuarial survival is 35%. For patients operated on for coronary artery disease, the 5-year survival is 100%."
7803,0.002,2.0000,"Throughout most of the past century, physicians could offer patients no treatments for infections caused by viruses. The experience with treatment of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has changed the way healthcare workers deal with viral infections and has triggered a growing rate of discovery and use of antiviral agents, the first fruits of the expanding genomics revolution. HIV treatment also provides an informative paradigm for pharmacogenomics because control of infection and its consequences is limited by the development of viral drug resistance and by host factors. This report summarizes studies published to date on the significance of testing of HIV-1 resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved kit is commercially available through Visible Genetics, Inc., for HIV drug resistance testing by genotypic sequencing. Genotyping sequencing alone is most likely an adequate test to assist in the therapeutic decision-making process in cases of previous regimen failure, treatment-naïve patients in areas of high prevalence of transmitted resistant virus, and pregnant women. However, in exceptional cases of highly complex mutation patterns and extensive cross-resistance, it may be useful to obtain a phenotype test, because that result may more easily identify drugs to which the virus is least resistant. There are no published clinical trial results on the usefulness of the so-called virtual phenotype over genotypic sequencing alone. The paradigm of viral pharmacogenomics in the form of HIV genotypic sequencing has been not only useful to the treatment of other viral diseases but also important to the real-life implementation of the growing discipline of genomics or molecular medicine. The application of this paradigm to the thousands of potential therapeutic targets that have become available through the various human genome projects will certainly gradually change the landscape of diagnosis and management of many diseases, including cancer."
3824,0.002,2.0000,"To investigate the factors associated with sexually transmitted infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (STI-HIV) co-infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). A total of 357 HIV-infected participants (84 STI-HIV co-infection and 273 HIV infections only) were recruited from Jiangsu, China. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the related factors associated with STI-HIV co-infection. Marginal structural models were adopted to estimate the effect of transmission drug resistance (TDR) on STI-HIV co-infection. For all participants, logistic regression analyses revealed that those who diagnosed with HIV-1 for longer duration (≥1.8 years) were significantly associated with reduced STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.32-0.96, P = 0.036). In further stratification analysis by antiretroviral therapy (ART), individuals with longer duration showed consistent significant associations with STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.26-0.83, P = 0.010) among MSM with ART-naïve status. In addition, significant reduced risk for STI-HIV co-infection (OR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-0.99, P = 0.010) were observed in younger (under the average age of 31.03) MSM of the same group. Interestingly, we also found TDR was significantly associated with an increased risk of STI-HIV co-infection risk (OR = 3.84, 95%CI: 1.05-14.03, P = 0.042) in ART-naïve group. Our study highlights a pattern of STI-HIV co-infection among MSM in China and indicates that targeted interventions aimed at encouraging TDR monitoring in MSM with early HIV infection are warranted."
10005,0.002,2.0000,"North American mission boards (N = 82) with programs in sub-Saharan Africa were surveyed to identify practices affecting risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among international staff. Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."
351,0.002,2.0000,"This paper's design is descriptive and correlational based on retrospective self-report survey data collected in Kunming city, China. The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."
5093,0.002,2.0000,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nail unit is a rare disorder. An association with high-risk genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been reported. We report a 28-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected bisexual man who had multiple invasive SCC of the fingers, infected with the rare type HPV 26. Classification of HPV 26 as high- or intermediate-risk type has been uncertain, due to its rare presence in cervical cancer. Despite successful treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the patient developed extensive hyperkeratotic nailbed proliferations of all fingers. Tumours were refractory to treatment and invaded into adjacent tissues. X-rays of the hands demonstrated bone invasion, necessitating amputation of distal phalanges of several fingers. Histologically, highly differentiated preinvasive and invasive verrucous SCCs were identified. Molecular DNA typing identified HPV 26 in the SCCs and in some premalignant lesions. By in situ hybridization HPV 26 DNA was detected in numerous tumour cells, indicating productive infection with high-level amplification of the viral genome. In the remaining proliferations, high-risk HPV type 58, cutaneous HPVs and a putative new HPV type were identified. HPV 26 infection appears to be causally involved in the development of SCC of the nail unit in this immunosuppressed patient. Timely evaluation of chronic verrucous nailbed tumours is recommended, especially in immunocompromised patients. Identification of HPV 26, besides known high-risk HPV types, may identify patients at risk for developing SCC of the nailbed and possibly at other locations."
7334,0.002,2.0000,"Red blood cell (RBC) deformability is a major determinant of the ability of the RBC to pass repeatedly through the microcirculation. A decrease in RBC deformability leads to tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to measure the rigidity of RBCs from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive individuals and investigate its relation to immune status and viral load. A filtration method based on the initial flow rate principle was used to determine the index of rigidity (IR) of 53 samples from HIV patients and 53 healthy individuals. The mean IR was significantly increased in patients with HIV compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.01). IR was inversely correlated with current CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (P < 0.0001). High CD4 cell counts (>200 cells/microl) are related to low IR values, independently of the viral load (VL). No differences in rigidity were noted between the VL groups, although there was a trend towards an increased IR in patients with high VL within the group of CD4<200. RBC deformability is decreased in HIV disease, in a degree mainly related to CD4 depletion. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the role of VL in highly immunocompromised HIV patients."
6571,0.002,2.0000,"The highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-1 RNA in plasma to undetectable levels. However, the virus continues to persist in the long-lived resting CD4(+) T cells, macrophages and astrocytes which form a viral reservoir in infected individuals. Reactivation of viral transcription is critical since the host immune response in combination with antiretroviral therapy may eradicate the virus. Using the chronically HIV-1 infected T lymphoblastoid and monocytic cell lines, primary quiescent CD4(+) T cells and humanized mice infected with dual-tropic HIV-1 89.6, we examined the effect of various X-ray irradiation (IR) doses (used for HIV-related lymphoma treatment and lower doses) on HIV-1 transcription and viability of infected cells. Treatment of both T cells and monocytes with IR, a well-defined stress signal, led to increase of HIV-1 transcription, as evidenced by the presence of RNA polymerase II and reduction of HDAC1 and methyl transferase SUV39H1 on the HIV-1 promoter. This correlated with the increased GFP signal and elevated level of intracellular HIV-1 RNA in the IR-treated quiescent CD4(+) T cells infected with GFP-encoding HIV-1. Exposition of latently HIV-1infected monocytes treated with PKC agonist bryostatin 1 to IR enhanced transcription activation effect of this latency-reversing agent. Increased HIV-1 replication after IR correlated with higher cell death: the level of phosphorylated Ser46 in p53, responsible for apoptosis induction, was markedly higher in the HIV-1 infected cells following IR treatment. Exposure of HIV-1 infected humanized mice with undetectable viral RNA level to IR resulted in a significant increase of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, lung and brain tissues. Collectively, these data point to the use of low to moderate dose of IR alone or in combination with HIV-1 transcription activators as a potential application for the ""Shock and Kill"" strategy for latently HIV-1 infected cells.

4429,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to evade the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response through a variety of escape avenues. Epitopes that are presented to CTLs are first processed in the presenting cell in several steps, including proteasomal cleavage, transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, binding by the HLA molecule, and finally presentation to the T-cell receptor. An understanding of the potential of the virus to escape CTL responses can aid in designing an effective vaccine. To investigate such a potential, we analyzed HIV-1 gag from 468 HIV-1-positive Kenyan women by using several bioinformatic approaches that allowed the identification of positively selected amino acids in the HIV-1 gag region and study of the effects that these mutations could have on the various stages of antigen processing. Correlations between positively selected residues and mean CD4 counts also allowed study of the effect of mutation on HIV disease progression. A number of mutations that could create or destroy proteasomal cleavage sites or reduce binding affinity of the transport antigen processing protein, effectively hindering epitope presentation, were identified. Many mutations correlated with the presence of specific HLA alleles and with lower or higher CD4 counts. For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B*5802 (P = 4.73 x 10(-4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019). Thus, V190I is a possible HLA escape mutant. This method classifies many positively selected mutations across the entire gag region according to their potential for immune escape and their effect on disease progression."
94,0.002,2.0000,"Hemodialysed patients are recognised as a group at increased risk of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and incidence of HCV infection among dialysis patients of the east-centre part of Tunisia. Two hundred and seventy-six patients dialysed until 2001 were recruited within seven hemodialysis units located in the cities of Sousse, Monastir and Mahdia. The serum markers of HCV infection were tested over the period of March 2000-December 2002, by a 3rd generation ELISA test for antibodies and by qualitative RT-PCR technique for viral RNA. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and of HCV RNA was 32.6% (90 patients) and 25.7% (71 patients), respectively. Between 1998 and 2002, 20 new infections were documented in five of the seven dialysis units corresponding to an incidence of 2.34% per year, with an average time of contamination after the beginning of dialysis of 4.6 years. If all the infections are assessed to have occurred during dialysis, the density of incidence of HCV contamination was 4.4% per year of dialysis. A high correlation was noticed between the presence of HCV markers in serum and the duration of dialysis (F = 34.15, P < 0.0001). In the absence of other risk factors (transfusion, drug-addiction), these results plead for the nosocomial transmission of the observed HCV infections. A phylogenetic analysis of the E2 hypervariable region of the viral genome is in progress to confirm this assumption."
3107,0.002,2.0000,"Population-wide variation in genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encompassing the V3 loop of the envelope protein was studied in serum samples of 74 newly infected individuals from three Dutch cohorts: 30 homosexual men, 32 drug users, and 12 hemophiliacs. During acute infection, HIV-1 RNA sequences present in serum are relatively homogeneous, which makes direct sequencing feasible. This offered an opportunity to study the infecting virus variants before mutations had accumulated in the new host. The sampling dates ranged from 1980 to 1991, thus spanning the entire AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands. The diversity in the sequenced region increased over time in both the homosexual and the drug-user risk groups. Furthermore, this increase was associated with an increase in antigenic variation, as witnessed by serum reactivity to a V3 peptide panel. Despite this diversification, some 1990 sequences still closely resembled the earliest 1980 sequence, making ancestral inferences problematic. No evidence was found of a change in the master sequence of the virus quasi-species over time. At the amino acid level, no risk-group-associated variation was found, but at the nucleotide level, the drug-user and homosexual/hemophiliac sequences could be distinguished on the basis of a single silent nucleotide change in the sequence encoding the tip of the V3 loop. Hemophiliac sequences could not be distinguished from those of homosexuals. In spite of the large and increasing genetic variability, all sequences were more similar to the European/American HIV consensus sequence than to that of non-Western strains."

The present study was undertaken to find out the prevalence of HIV infection, HBV infection and HCV infection among IDUs of a deaddiction centre. Serum samples from 250, injecting drug users (IDUs) from a de-addiction centre were screened for HBsAg using immunochromatography, anti HCV antibody by 3rd generation ELISA test and anti HIV antibody by ELISA test and immunochromatographic rapid test during the period August to October 2002. One hundred and forty-nine (59.6%) IDUs were positive for HIV antibody, 226 (90.4%) were positive for anti HCV antibody and 27 (10.8%) were positive for HBsAg. There was co-infection of HIV, HBV and HCV in 15 (6%) of the IDUs. The Co-infection of HBV and HCV were found in 12 cases (4.8%) and Co-infection of HIV and HCV was found in 131 cases (52.4%). The IDUs were in sexually active age group with a risk of infection to their sexual partner. There is high prevalence of HCV and HIV infection and co-infection of both viruses among IDUs. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged. Increase coverage of needle, syringe exchange programme (NSEP) to young and new IDUs is required before they are exposed to blood borne viruses."
7321,0.002,2.0000,"Incidence of brain infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patients is reduced after the availability of current high active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2) is an infrequent cause of encephalitis in HIV patients despite it is frequently involved in sexual transmitted infections. Here, we report a case of HSV-2 encephalitis occurring in a patient without full suppression of HIV replication within the brain. A 38 year-old HIV infected man was admitted to our department because of recurrent generalized seizure and fever during the previous 24 hours. Eight months before our observation the patient was switched from a protease inhibitor based regimen to a rilpivirine-based regimen without any evidence of HIV-RNA replication in the plasma. When the patient was admitted in our hospital, he was febrile and moderately confused, no deficit of cranial nerves was reported, motility was conserved, but he was unable to walk. Laboratory examinations performed at admission demonstrated an increase of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein and cells with lymphocyte prevalence, and normal CSF glucose. HSV-2-DNA and HIV-RNA were present within CSF at admission. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance imaging of the brain revealed lesions of the medial part of both temporal lobes including hippocampus without any sign of bleeding. A 21-day course of acyclovir therapy was administered with consistent improvement of clinical findings and disappearance of HSV-2-DNA within CSF. After the episode, HAART was switched to a regimen with high CSF penetrability containing abacavir, lamivudine, darunavir and ritonavir. Twelve months after HSV-2 encephalitis neurologic evaluation was normal, but symptoms of depression were reported, HIV-RNA remained undetectable both in the plasma and CSF, and CD4+ lymphocytes were above 500/μL. No opportunistic infection was reported. Patients switched to regimen well tolerated such those containing rilpivirine, that have poor drug concentration within CSF could be considered at risk for opportunistic infection of the brain. Further larger investigation needs to confirm this finding. "
2344,0.002,2.0000,"The indinavir dosage regimen currently used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children is not based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in the target patient population. The purpose of our study was to characterize indinavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in HIV-infected children. Eleven children (age range, 9.0 to 13.6 years; weight range, 21.7 to 56.0 kg) receiving indinavir (500 mg/m(2) every 8 h) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine were studied. The correlation of indinavir pharmacokinetic parameters and demographic parameters was evaluated. Also, the pharmacodynamic relationship between parameters of indinavir exposure and parameters of renal toxicity and immunologic recovery was studied. The area under the indinavir concentration-time curve (AUC) and patient body surface area (BSA) showed a significant negative correlation (r = 0.73; P = 0.012). Patients with smaller BSA had excessive indinavir AUC compared to adults. On the other hand, the median minimum drug concentration in plasma (C(min)) was lower than that reported for adults. The maximum indinavir concentration in serum was higher in patients with renal toxicity (5 out of 11 children), but the difference was not statistically significant (15.3 +/- 8.2 versus 9.8 +/- 4.4 mg/liter; P = 0.19). There was a trend toward higher immunologic efficacy in patients with greater indinavir exposure: the time-averaged AUC of the percentage of CD4(+) lymphocytes over the baseline value for patients with indinavir C(min) > 95% inhibitory concentration (IC(95)) was higher than in patients with C(min) < IC(95) (P = 0. 068). Our study suggests that a dose reduction may be appropriate for children with small BSA and that a 6-h dosage regimen may be indicated for a substantial percentage of patients. Due to the low number of patients enrolled in this study, our results should be confirmed by a larger study."
7169,0.002,2.0000,"Five hundred ninety students receiving primary care in a university health service were surveyed anonymously in 1985-86 to study their self-reported sexual behavior and knowledge and attitudes about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most students (75%) were heterosexual; 3% were homosexual, 3% bisexual, and 15% had never been sexually active. Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS."
8594,0.002,2.0000,"The U.S. military represents a unique population within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."
7267,0.002,2.0000,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."
8537,0.002,2.0000,"It is estimated that, in the United States and Europe, 15-30% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Among these patients, approximately 80% are intravenous drug users (IVDU), 71% are hemophiliacs, and around 20% are homosexual/bi-sexual men. HIV infection accelerates the natural history of HCV infection. On the contrary, highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces the rate of mortality due to liver disease by immune restoration. Since having HIV implies being at risk also for HCV as both infections can be acquired in similar ways, all individuals with the former should be screened for the latter. Loss of antibodies against HCV in HIV-seropositive IVDU has been shown. Thus, quantitative tests determining HCV-RNA levels in blood are currently being employed for diagnosis confirmation in case of an obvious ''risk group''. Since HIV can progress more rapidly than HCV, it may be preferable to treat HIV first. The 2007 recommendations from HCV-HIV International Panel indicate current treatment of HCV in coinfected patients with pegylated formulation of interferon at standard doses plus weight based ribavirin. The treatment duration should be evaluated on the basis of HCV genotype. Liver transplantation is a most debated issue when dealing with HCV/HIV coinfected subjects. Mortality among HIV-infected liver transplant recipients is similar to that of age and race-matched HIV-negative controls. The present concise review attempts to highlight on the current clinical situation on HIV/HCV coinfection."
5040,0.002,2.0000,"A range of quality of life (QOL) measurements specific for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are available. They were, however, developed before or at about the time of introducing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and there has been very little measurement developed from a Chinese perspective. A study was therefore undertaken and we report our findings of the first phase, in which Chinese people living with HIV/AIDS in Hong Kong were asked to explain their perceptions of QOL so as to identify their construct of QOL using a qualitative approach. Thirty-six participants, thirty males and six females, of mixed demographic and disease-related characteristics were recruited through purposive sampling. Following thematic analysis, nine QOL constructs emerged which included perceptions of adaptation and coping, physical health, stigmatization and discrimination, HIV care services, antiretroviral therapy, sexual relationships, relationships with family and friends, work and money, and pleasure and contentment. When comparing these constructs with those of Western populations, they contain more components on focusing psychosocial and spiritual aspects but less on functional status and HIV-related symptoms. The differences may not be attributed by cultural variations alone but also by the dynamic nature of QOL. Since there has been a rapid evolution of HIV medicine, instrument developers may need to regularly review and update measures of QOL. The subjective perceptions and experiences of targeted population should be addressed. Our findings also suggest the need of maintaining tailor-made psychosocial support services for HIV-infected people despite general reduction of morbidity and mortality from HAART."
5994,0.002,2.0000,"Subjects at risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are also at high risk of acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HIV is associated with higher HBV viraemia and with the risk of HBV reactivation, chronic active HBV infection, cirrhosis and death. Therefore, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all HIV-infected subjects lacking prior immunity. However, the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine is frequently suboptimal in this population. High CD4+ cell counts and low HIV viraemia are well known factors associated with a better rate of response. Moreover, higher hepatitis B vaccine doses and/or prolongation of the vaccination schedule, as implemented for patients with immune deficiencies other than HIV, may be considered. New vaccination cycles should be considered if post-vaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are < 10 mIU/mL (< 10 UI/L). The immunization of all young and middle-aged adults appears to be the most useful strategy to protect all patient-populations at high risk of sexually transmitted diseases."
7271,0.002,2.0000,"Despite improvement of life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected people since the implementation of antiretroviral treatment, psychological suffering prevails and needs to be considered as part of the treatment to guarantee its efficiency. Mental disorders and social stigmatization substantially affect patients' quality of life and their adherence to treatment. The article details the benefits of a routine screening for mental disorders within this population, who is often reluctant to consult psychiatric services. The different treatments provided by the Geneva University Hospital (HUG) are introduced. A clinical case report illustrates the relevance of a multidisciplinary care program and the role of the liaison psychiatry in this field."
3490,0.002,2.0000,"Viral quasispecies analysis is important for basic and clinical research. This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047× and 687× in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

1688,0.002,2.0000,"Our objective was to analyse the characteristics of patients who were unaware of their HIV infection until they developed AIDS, in the period after introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. The complete national register of HIV and AIDS cases reported to the Department of Epidemiology at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control 1996-2002 was searched for cases diagnosed with HIV less than three months before AIDS diagnosis (so-called ""late testers""). Of a total of 487 patients with AIDS, reported during the seven-year period, 219 (45%) were late testers. Their proportion of all AIDS cases increased from 22% in 1996 to 58% in 2002. Heterosexual route of transmission, age greater than 40 years, and foreign origin were all significant risk factors for being a late tester. Intravenous drug users were associated with a highly significant reduced risk. The group without previously known HIV infection represents an increasing part of all cases of AIDS. From a disease control and from a medical perspective, it is important to study this group further and discover what measures are needed for earlier identification and access to medical care."
2323,0.002,2.0000,"A defect in specific T cell immunity has long been assumed to be the central mechanism of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically naïve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."
8726,0.002,2.0000,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B. In addition, this isolate had a new insertion (Glu-34 duplication) in the protease gene."
1314,0.002,2.0000,"Patient self-reported outcomes are increasingly important in measuring disease, treatment and care outcomes. It is unclear what constitutes well-being using a combined biomedical and psychosocial approach for patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) access. This study aimed to determine the variance within the visual analogue scale (VAS) measure of health status using the existing five dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, to identify which domains have the greatest effect on self-reported health status and to identify associations with the VAS using both biomedical and psychosocial factors among HIV outpatients. Consecutive patients in five UK clinics were recruited to a cross-sectional survey, n=778 (86% response rate). Patients self-completed validated measures, with treatment variables extracted from file. On the EuroQOL-5D, nearly one-third (28.1%) had mobility problems, one-fifth (18.7%) self-care problems, one-third (37.4%) difficulty in performing usual tasks and one-half (44.4%) reported pain/discomfort. In the regression model to determine associations with self-reported health status (VAS score), neither CD4 count nor ART status was associated with the outcome. However, in addition to four dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, poorer health status was associated with worse physical symptom burden, treatment optimism and psychological symptoms. There is a relatively high prevalence of psychological morbidity and poor physical function, and these burdens of disease are associated with worse self-reported health status. As HIV management focuses on treatment for extended survival and a chronic model of disease, clinical attention to physical and psychological dimensions of patient care are essential to achieve optimal well-being."
6962,0.002,2.0000,"This study aimed to investigate the correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related discrimination among general practitioners. The survey, conducted in 1993-1994, covered a random sample of 878 general practitioners from six of the 12 New South Wales health areas, augmented by 44-general practitioners from the same areas who were antiretroviral drug prescribers. The response rate was 51 per cent, and the final usable sample was 451. Variables examined were: demographic characteristics, the number of HIV-infected patients, personal contact with people living with HIV or AIDS, personal contact with homosexuals, the degree of anxiety about HIV or AIDS, and the degree of HIV-related discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes among general practitioners decreased as contact with HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001), other people living with HIV or AIDS (P < 0.001), and homosexuals (P < 0.001) increased. Anxiety about HIV or AIDS also decreased as contact increased (P < 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were strongly associated with higher levels of HIV-related discrimination (P < 0.001). The demographic correlates of discrimination among general practitioners were the same as those found in the wider population. The professional care of people living with HIV and AIDS was concentrated among a small number of general practitioners, many of whom were homosexual. Ten general practitioners were carrying extraordinarily high caseloads of over 200 HIV-infected patients each. Older, heterosexual and male general practitioners are an important target for education campaigns, and the professional care of people living with HIV or AIDS should be encouraged among a wider group of general practitioners."
6094,0.002,2.0000,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."
1820,0.002,2.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
6725,0.002,2.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-positive subjects are uncommon in their ability to control infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, late viral escape from a narrowly directed immunodominant Gag-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CTL) response has been linked to AIDS progression in these individuals. Identifying the mechanism of the immune-mediated control may provide critical insights into HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we illustrate that the CTL escape mutation R(264)K in the HLA-B27-restricted KK10 epitope in the capsid resulted in a significant defect in viral replication in vitro. The R(264)K variant was impaired in generating late reverse transcription products, indicating that replication was blocked at a postentry step. Notably, the R(264)K mutation was associated in vivo with the development of a rare secondary mutation, S(173)A, which restored viral replication in vitro. Furthermore, infectivity of the R(264)K variant was rescued by the addition of cyclosporine A or infection of a cyclophilin A-deficient cell line. These data demonstrate a severe functional defect imposed by the R(264)K mutation during an early step in viral replication that is likely due to the inability of this variant to replicate efficiently in the presence of normal levels of cyclophilin A. We conclude that the impact of the R(264)K substitution on capsid structure constrains viral escape and enables long-term maintenance of the dominant CTL response against B27-KK10, providing an explanation for the protective effect of HLA-B27 during HIV infection."
9481,0.002,2.0000,"We examined the association of primary or nonprimary sexual partner relationship status on sexual risk behaviors, including condom use, among Latina women who are at self-disclosed increased heterosexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data were collected via structured interviews of 187 Puerto Rican women, aged 18-35, who attended a health clinic in the Bronx, New York. Approximately 13% of participants reported sexual activities with both primary and nonprimary sexual partners during the 6 months prior to the interview. Primary or nonprimary sexual partner status was associated with significant differences in frequency of condom use during anal sex and oral-penile sex, with more frequent condom use reported during these sexual activities with nonprimary sexual partners. Thus, potential contextual differences associated with primary or nonprimary relationship status may represent important factors to consider when designing interventions to facilitate HIV-protective behaviors among populations of urban women identified at increased heterosexual risk for HIV infection."
6581,0.002,2.0000,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
5933,0.002,2.0000,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family is involved in a two-stage detoxification process of a wide range of environmental toxins, carcinogen and antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (ART) drugs. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1-313A/G in the risk of ARV-associated hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals and its modulation in hepatotoxic patients. We enrolled a total of 34 patients with hepatotoxicity, 131 HIV-infected individuals without hepatotoxicity under non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor containing ART and 153 unrelated healthy individuals. With a case-control design, polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1-313A/G gene were genotyped by PCR and restriction enzyme-length polymorphism. Genotypes of GSTT1 null were significantly higher in HIV-infected individuals as compared with healthy controls (P=0.01, odds ratio (OR)=1.54). HIV-infected individuals with GSTM1-null genotype showed higher risk (P=0.09, OR=1.37) for hepatotoxicity, but risk was not significant. On evaluating gene-gene interaction models, GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null showed significant association with the risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.004, OR=2.67) owing to synergistic effect of these genes. Individuals with GSTT1-null and GSTM1-null genotypes showed higher risk of hepatotoxicity with advanced stage of (CD4<200) of HIV infection (P=0.18, OR=1.39; P=0.63, OR=1.13). In case-only analysis, GSTT1-null genotype among alcohol users showed elevated risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.12, OR=1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94-1.97) as compared with GSTT1 genotypes. The carriers GSTM1-null+GSTT1-null genotype among nevirapine user showed prominent risk of hepatotoxicity in HIV-infected individuals (P=0.12, OR=4.21, 95% CI: 0.60-29.54). Hence, we can conclude that GSTT1-null and GSTM1-null genotypes alone and in combination may predict the acquisition of hepatotoxicity."
325,0.002,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
3099,0.002,2.0000,"Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is increased by different cytokines and T cell activators, also known to modulate tyrosine phosphorylation levels. A novel class of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors, peroxovanadium (pV) compounds, were tested for a putative effect on HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. We found that these PTP inhibitors markedly enhanced HIV-1 LTR activity in 1G5 cells, a stably transfected cell line that harbors an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct. A direct correlation between the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation and the level of HIV-1 LTR inducibility was seen after treatment with three different pV compounds. Transient transfection experiments were carried out in several T cell lines, and after addition of pV, a marked increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was measured. Monocytoid cells were tested using U937-derived cell lines and were also found to be sensitive to the pV-mediated potentiating effect on HIV-1 LTR activity. A significant reduction of the pV-mediated increase in HIV-1 LTR activity was seen in cells transiently transfected with an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase construct bearing a mutation in both NF-kappaB binding sites although detectable levels of induction remained. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays allowed the identification of the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p50.p65 heterodimer complex induced by pV compounds. A dominant negative version of the repressor IkappaBalpha mutated on serines 32 and 36 impeded pV-induced NF-kappaB-dependent luciferase activity. Western blot analysis showed a clear diminution in the protein level of IkappaBalpha starting 30 min after pV treatment of Jurkat E6.1 cells which is indicative of its degradation. On the other hand, no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on IkappaBalpha itself. Finally, we tested the PTP inhibitors on four cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and showed a consistent pV-mediated increase in virion production. Thus, our studies suggest that pV-mediated activation of HIV-1 LTR activity is controlled by the nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor, which is mediated by IkappaBalpha serine phosphorylation and degradation, but also by a still undefined NF-kappaB-independent pathway."
3277,0.002,2.0000,"We used a population-based cohort study design to describe the demographic characteristics of the HIV-infected population in Denmark and their variation over time. HIV treatment in Denmark is restricted to 9 centres, and all 3941 HIV-1 infected patients more than 15 y old seen at these centres in 1995-2003 were included. We found an estimated HIV prevalence of 70 per 100,000, and a mean annual incidence rate of 5.1 per 100,000 persons. The number of newly infected individuals was stable with a median of 231 per y (period 1995-2002), whereas the number of deaths decreased from 166 in 1995 to 50 in 2000 (p=0.000) and remained stable thereafter. Of the enrolled patients, 75% were males, 80% were Caucasian, 13% were black African, and the primary risk behaviour was male-to-male sexual contact (44%), heterosexual contact (36%), and injection drug use (11%). During the y 1995-2003 we found an increase in age at diagnosis (p=0.000), and no major changes in gender, race, mode of infection, or baseline CD4+ cell count and viral load, neither overall not within subgroups of patients. In this period 14.5% had AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis. Our data do not confirm concerns about unmonitored evolution in the HIV epidemic in Denmark."
2728,0.002,2.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
87,0.002,2.0000,"The purpose of this open and multicenter trial was to determine the usefulness of antibody detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in gingival crevicular transudate (GCT), which was collected with an investigational device (Orasure; Epitope, Beaverton, Oreg.), for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and to compare it with antibody detection in serum. A total of 1,880 individuals were tested, as follows: 354 HIV-1-infected individuals (111 asymptomatics individuals and 243 individuals with AIDS), 46 individuals with autoimmune diseases (AD), 296 individuals with dental diseases, 42 individuals with other chronic diseases, and 1,142 healthy individuals. Sera from 356 individuals and GCT from 354 individuals were positive for HIV-1 antibodies. There were two false-negative gingival samples, one from an HIV-1-positive asymptomatic individual and one from a patient with AIDS. HIV-1 antibodies were unexpectedly detected in both serum and GCT of two individuals, one with dental disease and one with pulmonary tuberculosis. None of the sera or GCTs from healthy subjects or patients with AD were positive. Compared with the serum assay, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the GCT assay were 99.5, 100, 100, and 99.9%, respectively. Of 355 paired serum-GCT samples that were HIV-1 positive by ELISA and that were tested by Western blot (immunoblot), all were positive for HIV-1 by using the U.S. Public Health Service interpretation criteria, while among gingival samples, 301 were positive, 52 were indeterminate, and 2 were negative. Of 82 negative paired samples selected at random, 80 were negative by Western blotting of serum and GCT and 2 were indeterminate by Western blotting of serum and negative by Western blotting of GCT (a healthy blood donor and a patient with dermatopolymyositis). Testing for HIV-1 antibodies in GCT is a simple and reliable screening procedure in populations with high and low prevalences of infection because of the high sensitivity and specificity of the method, and it offers improved safety for hospital personnel."
3526,0.002,2.0000,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."
40,0.002,2.0000,"We experienced Hepatitis A, B, C and fulminant hepatitis due to Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in our hospital for the severely multi-disabled (SMD) who had both severe motor and intellectual disabilities, and some of whom might be further complicated by blindness and/or deafness. In this hospital, 100 SMDs are hospitalized. Case 1: The disabled, 25 year old male, was transmitted Hepatitis A from a nurse. Case 2: The disabled, 60 year old female carrier of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) who has been cared for more than 10 years. Case 3: The disabled, 46 year old male carrier of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (RNA type 3), has been cared for more than 4 years. Case 4: The disabled, 39 year old male, had a fever of 39 degrees C for 9 days and suddenly died. He was diagnosed as fulminant hepatitis due to HSV-1 by necropsy. The hospitals for SMD are characteristic in prevention of nosocomial infections; 1) The disabled infected is not aware of the fact that he or she is the source of infection and that the other disabled living with him or her are in risk of infection, because of their severe mental condition. 2) All of the disabled need complete or incomplete helps for activities of daily life (ADL), so that the disabled who is the carrier of some pathogen constantly gives risk of infection to staffs, including medical staffs (doctor, nurse and therapist), psychologist and helpers by bloody secretion from wounds, saliva, urine, feces as well as menstrual blood. 3) If a carrier of some pathogen is hospitalized, the staffs should serve under risk of infection involving blood-mediated infectious disease for many years, because SMDs are permitted lifelong stay in the hospitals for SMD, which also play a role of care house or institution, by public expense in Japan. In case of an outbreak of Hepatitis A, nosocomial infection ended in the original case (a nurse), another nurse and a case of the disabled by general treatment and care against communicable diseases of the digestive organs. In care of HBV and HCV carriers, an ordinary program to prevent nosocomial infection has been practiced in our hospital more strictly than in conventional hospital. HBV vaccine is injected to staffs caring the HB carriers who are negative on HBs antibody. Thus, during more than 10 years of care of HBV carrier and more than 4 years of care of HCV carrier, nosocomial infection has never been experienced clinically as well as serologically in our hospital. However, we have often been faced by difficulty to guarantee QOL (quality of life) of the carriers, because carrier states of HBV or HCV have been long-lasting and they have been occasionally and inevitably separated physically and/or psychologically in order to prevent nosocomial infection. In case 4, it was suspected that previously latently infected HSV-1 would be activated by another viral infection which had elicited fever for 9 days before death. The patient had neither history nor sign or symptom of immunodeficiency and had never been given drugs known as to be immunosuppressive as side effect."
9979,0.002,2.0000,"The effect of a single bolus injection (0.4 g/kg) of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients was investigated. At 140 h after infusion, there was a significant decrease in levels of TNF-alpha and a significant increase in levels of soluble TNF receptors (sTNFR) in both plasma and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A rapid (within 1 h) decline in expression of membrane-bound TNF-alpha and p55-TNFR on PBMC persisted throughout the study. In contrast, there was an increased expression of membrane-bound p75-TNFR after 140 h. IVIG administration also resulted in significantly increased numbers of circulating CD4 lymphocytes, correlated with down-regulation of TNF-alpha activity in PBMC supernatants. Thus, down-regulation of the abnormally increased TNF-alpha activity may be achieved by IVIG administration. Studies evaluating the possible therapeutic role of long-term TNF-alpha suppression by IVIG may be warranted in HIV-1-infected patients."
7580,0.002,2.0000,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
458,0.002,2.0000,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to increase the risk of death from severe liver disease and, because HCV status is strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use, the effect of a key disease progression cofactor, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of interest. We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."
2718,0.002,2.0000,"We examined prospectively the influence of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the histopathological features and clinical outcome of HCV RNA-positive chronic hepatitis (CH-C) and detected hepatitis B core (HBc) particles in hepatocytes. The subjects were 468 patients with CH-C or liver cirrhosis (LC) who were negative for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HBV DNA was detected in serum by nested PCR. HBsAg and HBc antigen (HBcAg) in liver were investigated using immunohistochemical techniques and light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Serum HBV DNA was detected in 43.6% of the patients studied. There were no significant differences between HBV DNA-positive and DNA-negative patients in terms of their clinical profiles. For HBV DNA-positive patients, the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and irregular regeneration of hepatocytes was significantly greater than for HBV DNA-negative patients. The cumulative probability of development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly higher for HBV DNA-positive patients than for HBV DNA-negative patients. HBV DNA positivity was a risk factor for the occurrence of HCC according to multivariate analysis. HBsAg and HBcAg were detected in 8.5 and 72.3%, respectively, of the livers of serum HBV DNA-positive individuals. Core particles were detected in the nuclei of the hepatocytes by IEM. The histopathological features and long-term outcome of CH-C or LC could be affected by occult HBV infection."
1410,0.002,2.0000,"Despite the increased incidence of tuberculosis related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recent decades, pancreatic tuberculosis has rarely been described. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis in a 39-year-old African man who presented with progressive dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss and productive cough, accompanied by localized epigastric pain and one episode of melena. HIV-1 testing was positive and lymphocyte subset profile showed CD(4) count of 9/mm(3). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, significant portal and retroperitoneal cystic adenopathy, and multiple cystic lesions in the spleen and liver. CT guided cyst aspiration and node biopsy detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded well on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy. Tuberculosis rarely involves the pancreas, probably due to the presence of pancreatic enzymes which interfere with the seeding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is considered to be the result of dissemination of the infection from nearby lymphatic nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound or CT guided fine needle aspiration for cytology is the recommended diagnostic technique. Although the prognosis is good with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it could be fatal without correct diagnosis and treatment. The clinician's high index of suspicion of pancreatic tuberculosis and application of FNAB to obtain pathological evidence are extremely important to a correct diagnosis, especially in young HIV positive patients."
1555,0.002,2.0000,"Drug resistance mutations in the Pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) are one of the critical factors associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in HIV-1 patients. The issue of resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) in HIV infection has not been adequately addressed in the Indian subcontinent. We compared HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene sequences to identify mutations present in HIV-1 patients who were ART non-responders, ART responders and drug naive. Genotypic drug resistance testing was performed by sequencing a 655-bp region of the RT gene from 102 HIV-1 patients, consisting of 30 ART-non-responding, 35 ART-responding and 37 drug-naive patients. The Stanford HIV Resistance Database (HIVDBv 6.2), IAS-USA mutation list, ANRS_09/2012 algorithm, and Rega v8.02 algorithm were used to interpret the pattern of drug resistance. The majority of the sequences (96 %) belonged to subtype C, and a few of them (3.9 %) to subtype A1. The frequency of drug resistance mutations observed in ART-non-responding, ART-responding and drug-naive patients was 40.1 %, 10.7 % and 20.58 %, respectively. It was observed that in non-responders, multiple mutations were present in the same patient, while in responders, a single mutation was found. Some of the drug-naive patients had more than one mutation. Thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), however, were found in non-responders and naive patients but not in responders. Although drug resistance mutations were widely distributed among ART non-responders, the presence of resistance mutations in the viruses of drug-naive patients poses a big concern in the absence of a genotyping resistance test."
3868,0.002,2.0000,"In order to characterize novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) continuous epitopes, we designed a simple method, based on recombinant DNA, providing a complete set of peptides derived from HIV-1. A library (4 x 10(4) clones) was first constructed in a new expression/secretion vector, using as inserts small fragments of HIV-1 DNA (50-150 bp) generated by random DNAse I cleavage. This peptide library, expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was screened with sera of HIV-1 infected individuals and human and murine anti-HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies. Plasmids from immunoreactive colonies were recovered and the sequences of the HIV-1 derived inserts were determined. By using human sera, we have detected classical HIV-1 epitopes and identified two novel major epitopes, which may be used to improve diagnostic tests, localized in the p24 core protein and in the endonuclease. In addition, four minor epitopes were also defined by screening the library with monoclonal antibodies: in the protease, in the p17 core protein, in gp120 and near the C-terminal of gp41. This method is general and can be used for any protein from which a cloned cDNA is available."
6437,0.002,2.0000,"Immigration from developing regions to Western countries has resulted in an increased rate of non-B subtypes in the HIV population. However, it is unclear whether these HIV variants remain confined to foreigners or are already spreading among natives. Since many immigrants come from regions in which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic, HIV-hepatitis coinfection might be more frequent in newly diagnosed HIV persons. Herein, we report changes in the prevalence and distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Madrid, Spain over the past 10 years as well as the rate of chronic HBV and HCV coinfection in 1854 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals. Overall 18.2% carried HIV-1 non-B subtypes, although the prevalence increased over time reaching a peak of 19.4% in the last period (2007-2010). The most common non-B variants were CRF02_AG (37%), G (12%), A (9.9%), and C (7.8%). In native Spaniards the rate of non-B subtypes increased from 1.5% in 2000-2002 to 7.2% in 2003-2006 and to 11.4% in 2007-2010 (p = 0.04). Chronic hepatitis B and C were found, respectively, in 4.2% and 8.3% of the study population. While the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B has remained fairly stable over time across distinct populations, the rate of chronic HCV infection has experienced a significant decline, mainly in native Spaniards as a result of a reduction in intravenous drug use. In summary, the prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is rising in newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Spain, including the native population. In contrast, the rate of HBV coinfection remains unchanged and the rate of HCV coinfection has declined."
4417,0.002,2.0000,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 life cycle and represents a primary target for drug discovery efforts against HIV-1 infection. Two classes of RT inhibitors, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and the nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors are prominently used in the highly active antiretroviral therapy in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has limited the successful rate of the anti-HIV agents. Computational methods are a significant part of the drug design process and indispensable to study drug resistance. In this review, recent advances in computer-aided drug design for the rational design of new compounds against HIV-1 RT using methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculations, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophore modelling and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity prediction are discussed. Successful applications of these methodologies are also highlighted. "
7683,0.002,2.0000,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
5222,0.002,2.0000,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
2640,0.002,2.0000,"Immunovirologic parameters of 24 heavily antiretroviral drug-pretreated patients with prolonged virologic treatment failure under highly active antiretroviral therapy, and who harbored highly resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates, were studied in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Most of the patients were injecting drug users (71%) and male (88%). All patients were studied for CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, resistance mutations, and viral phenotype. The patients showed a high accumulation of resistance-associated mutations, their CD4(+) cell count and viral load directly correlated with their respective values at initiation of therapy, and the presence of K103N was inversely associated with lower viral load. On the other hand, patients with K103N had the same level of CD4(+) cell count compared with patients without this mutation. Among the patients, a majority with a specific viral phenotype was not present. Rather, a dual-tropic virus was found most frequently, suggesting a preferential suppression of X4-specific strains and less cytopathogenicity during antiretroviral therapy and a greater proportion of R5X4 viruses due to an adaptation to that pressure."
7508,0.002,2.0000,"Human papilloma virus (HPV)-like particles (VLPs) have been used as a vaccine to prevent HPV infection. Recent studies demonstrate that VLPs bind to dendritic cells and induce the expression of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IFN-gamma. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of VLPs on HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. Here, we show that VLPs suppress the replication of both X4 and R5 HIV-1 without affecting the expression of CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5. Soluble factor(s) released by PBMCs and macrophages on VLPs treatment inhibited HIV-1 replication. To determine the inhibitory factors, DNA microarray analysis was performed using VLP-treated PBMCs and macrophages. VLPs induced the genes associated with IFN induction, immune responses, and antiviral responses, among with the recently described cytokine IL-27. Subsequently, IL-27 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in PBMCs, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. Taken together, our studies identify a novel role of IL-27 in restricting HIV-1 replication and suggest that further examination of the inhibitory property of IL-27 may pave the way for a novel therapy for HIV-1 infection."
1927,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 circulates in vivo as a mixture of heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 in an infected individual and found that the species with a basic amino acid substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression."
4831,0.002,2.0000,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
3727,0.002,2.0000,"Genotyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) for antiretroviral drug resistance is routinely used both in clinical practice, to guide the selection of options for an individual's antiretroviral therapy, and in epidemiological studies, to estimate levels of antiretroviral drug resistance in a patient population. However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."
1832,0.002,2.0000,"To assess the prevalence of mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral-naive patients in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was conducted among drug-naive HIV-1 patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) between July 2003 and June 2004. Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."
5667,0.002,2.0000,"The mechanisms responsible for the persistence of HIV-1 after many years of suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been only partially elucidated. Most of the studies investigating HIV-1 persistence have been performed with blood, although it is well known that germinal centers (GCs) within lymph nodes (LNs) serve as primary sites for HIV-1 replication. We sought to identify the memory CD4 T cell populations in blood and LNs that are responsible for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, as well as for active and persistent virus transcription in ART-treated (for 1.5-14.0 years), aviremic (<50 HIV RNA copies/ml) HIV-infected individuals. We demonstrate that LN CD4 T cells that express programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1; also known as PD-1), which are composed of about 65% T follicular helper cells as defined by the expression of the cell surface receptors CXCR5 and PD-1, are the major source of replication-competent HIV-1 and of infectious virus, as compared to any other (CXCR5(-)PD-1(-) and CXCR5(+)PD-1(-)) blood or LN memory CD4 T cell populations. LN PD-1(+) cells accounted for 46% and 96% of the total pools of memory CD4 T cells containing inducible replication-competent or infectious virus, respectively. Notably, higher levels of cell-associated HIV-1 RNA were present in LN PD-1(+) cells after long-term (up to 12 years) ART than in other memory CD4 T cell subpopulations. These results indicate that LN PD-1(+) cells are the major CD4 T cell compartment in the blood and LNs for the production of replication-competent and infectious HIV-1, and for active and persistent virus transcription in long-term-ART-treated aviremic individuals. Thus, these cells may represent a major obstacle to finding a functional cure for HIV-1 infection."

The aim of this study was to determine the rate of infection and genotypic characteristics of GBV-C in this population. The presence of GBV-C RNA was determined in serum samples of 106 patients infected with HIV by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction. GBV-C genotypes were determined by direct sequencing. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HIV viral load and CD4(+) count were also tested in all patients. The overall prevalence of GBV-C infection was 11.3% in HIV patients. There was no significant difference between patients with and without GBV-C infection regarding age, sex, route of transmission, viral load, ALT levels, HBV and HCV co-infection and treatment with antiretroviral drugs. 66.7% of patients with GBV-C had a CD4(+) count > or = 200 and 33.3% had a CD4(+) count < 200 cells/mm(3). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all GBV-C isolates were genotype 2, and classified as subtype 2a. GBV-C infection is relatively common in patients infected with HIV. The prevailing GBV-C genotype 2a in this study group concurred with reports from other parts of the Middle East."
7023,0.002,2.0000,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."

An 18-year-old Japanese man with HIV and HBV co-infection presented to our hospital. His CD4 count was decreased, and TDF-based HARRT was started. At 30 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAg was not detected. At 36 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAb was detected. We conclude that TDF-based therapy is useful for the management of patients with HBV and HIV co-infection. "

The existence of HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance may be important for treatment choice. We studied two patients with chronic HBV infection by sequencing the HBV polymerase gene. They had adefovir- and tenofovir-related mutations in the viral polymerase, although they had never been treated. These mutations were rtV214A/rtN238T in one patient and rtA194T in the other. Thus, mutations in untreated patients deserve cautious surveillance. These data indicate that mutations that can theoretically confer adefovir or tenofovir resistance may emerge in treatment-naive patients."
5484,0.002,2.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a known complication during and after anti-cancer therapy. This condition can affect two patient populations: it is most commonly seen in patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but it is also being increasingly reported among patients who are HBsAg-negative but who have prior infection, as evident by seropositive status for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), irrespective of their anti-HBs (antibody to HBsAg) status. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic hepatitis to fulminant hepatic failure that can be potentially fatal. With the increasing use of biological agents in addition to potent cytotoxic chemotherapy in the armamentarium of anti-cancer treatments, reactivation of hepatitis B has become a common clinical situation that is faced by both oncologists and hepatologists especially in HBV endemic areas. In this review, we discuss the clinical course of reactivation in the two HBV-infected sub-populations, and the role of anti-virals in the prevention and management of HBV reactivation in association with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapies."
4972,0.002,2.0000,"The surveillance of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) through case reporting only reflects the epidemiologic features of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission a few years earlier and not the prevalence of HIV seropositivity. HIV infection is not a notifiable condition in Quebec. We were asked by the ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux du Québec to perform a pilot project for the surveillance of HIV seropositivity using a network of sentinel physicians. From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
9367,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) canarypox vaccines are safe but poorly immunogenic. CD40 ligand (CD40L), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF), is a pivotal costimulatory molecule for immune responses. To explore whether CD40L can be used as an adjuvant for HIV-1 canarypox vaccine, we constructed recombinant canarypox viruses expressing CD40L. Co-immunization of mice with CD40L expressing canarypox and the canarypox vaccine expressing HIV-1 proteins, vCP1452, augmented HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in terms of frequency, polyfunctionality and interleukin (IL)-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha, CD127) expression. In addition, CD40L expressed from canarypox virus could significantly augment CD4+ T cell responses against HIV-1 in mice. CD40L expressed from canarypox virus matured human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) in a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) independent manner, which underwent less apoptosis, and could expand ex vivo Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CTL responses from healthy human individuals and ex vivo HIV-1-specific CTL responses from HIV-1-infected individuals in the presence or absence of CD4+ T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CD40L incorporation into poxvirus vectors could be used as a strategy to enhance their immunogenicity."
5972,0.002,2.0000,"Considerable controversy and uncertainty have surrounded the biological function of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 nef gene product. Initial studies suggested that this early, nonstructural viral protein functioned as a negative regulatory factor; thus, it was proposed to play a role in establishing or maintaining viral latency. In contrast, studies in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)mac-infected rhesus monkeys have suggested that Nef is not a negative factor but rather plays a central role in promoting high-level viral replication and is required for viral pathogenesis in vivo. We sought to define a tissue culture system that would approximate the in vivo setting for virus infection in order to assess the role of HIV-1 Nef in viral replication. We show that infection of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with Nef+ HIV results in enhanced replication as evidenced by earlier gag p24 expression when compared with infections performed with nef mutant viruses. Moreover, when unstimulated freshly isolated PBMC are infected with Nef+ and Nef- viruses and then subsequently activated with mitogen, the Nef-induced difference in viral replication kinetics is even more pronounced, with the Nef- viruses requiring much more time in culture for appreciable growth. A positive effect of Nef on viral replication was also observed in primary macrophages infected with a recombinant of YU-2, a patient-derived molecular clone with macrophage tropism. These positive effects of Nef on viral replication are dependent on the initial multiplicity of infection (MOI), in that infections of unstimulated PBMC at low MOI are most dependent upon intact nef for subsequent viral growth. We now provide evidence that the Nef+ HIV is more infectious than Nef- HIV from both a tissue culture infectious dose analysis, and a single-cell HIV infection assay. In the latter case, we demonstrate that infection with equivalent doses of HIV based on virion-associated gag p24 yields five- to sixfold more infected cells if Nef+ viral stocks were used. Furthermore, we find that the differential infectivity is not dependent on CD4 down-regulation as Nef+ virus produced from transfected COS cells lacking CD4 is also more infectious. However, normalization of PBMC infections to equivalent infectivity between that of the Nef+ and Nef- viruses continues to reveal delayed viral replication in the absence of Nef, suggesting that secondary viral spread in PBMC is also enhanced in Nef+ infections. We demonstrate this directly by showing a 13-15-fold increase in infectivity of PBMC-derived Nef+ HIC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
6296,0.002,2.0000,"The impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the outcome of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphoma with life-threatening complications requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission is not well known. The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of patients with lymphoma transferred to the ICU according to HIV infection status. The clinical characteristics, reason for ICU admission, and outcome of 48 consecutive critically ill patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU from January 2000 to March 2010 was retrospectively analyzed, focusing on their HIV serology status. Thirty-six patients were HIV-negative and 12 patients HIV-positive. Burkitt lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-infected patients, whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was more frequent in HIV-negative patients. The main acute life-threatening diseases precipitating ICU transfer were similar in both groups. Severe neutropenia was more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients. With a median follow-up of 53 months after ICU admission, the overall survival probabilities were 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3-27%) and 17% (95% CI: 0-38%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients, respectively. The 2-year survival probabilities were 34% (95% CI: 10-58%) and 40% (95% CI: 0-43%) for HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients discharged from the ICU, respectively. In this study, HIV infection did not have a negative impact on the outcome of patients with lymphoma admitted to the ICU."

The long-term outcome of infection acquired in youth was assessed in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV and in patients with HBV infection only. Twenty-seven patients with HBV and HCV co-infection and 27 patients infected with HBV only were enrolled. Seventy-six per cent of the patients were treated with alpha-interferon for 1 year. After a median follow-up of 23 years, the annual progression rate of fibrosis was 0.07 in patients co-infected with HBV and HCV, and in those infected with HBV it was 0.07 and 0.11 (P < 0.004) for HBe and anti-HBe-positive patients, respectively. In co-infected patients, the development of cirrhosis was observed in 2 (7.4%) and of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 1 (3.7%), while in those with HBV, cirrhosis appeared in one patient (3.7%). Alcohol intake (OR = 9.5 +/- 1.2; 95% CI = 6.6-13.9; P < 0.0001) was independently associated with cirrhosis and HCC. alpha-interferon showed no efficacy during treatment, but the treated group showed higher HCV RNA clearance during post-treatment follow-up. Co-infection with HBV and HCV and single HBV infection acquired in youth showed a low rate of progression to liver fibrosis, no liver failure, and low development of HCC during a median follow-up of 23 years (range 17-40)."
7938,0.002,2.0000,"Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and the important role that viral load plays in the initial selection of antiretroviral therapy significantly alters our management of this disease. Guidelines from the British HIV Association, International AIDS Society-USA, and United States Public Health Service panels regarding the selection of appropriate antiretroviral therapy, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, have recently been published. Despite tremendous advances in treating the disease and its related complications, a comprehensive, long-term disease management plan that includes recognition of patient concerns about quality of life is lacking. New approaches to managing HIV disease must now include strategies that address patient concerns about fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, malnutrition, and weight loss. Patients must become more involved in decisions about selection of specific drugs and drug regimens and must be consulted about their expectations and needs. We have made significant strides in the treatment of HIV disease. We can readily reduce the viral burden to virtually undetectable levels, and we must continue to develop even more potent and tolerable treatment regimens. We can make patients live longer. Helping patients live better quality lives deserves further study."
7695,0.002,2.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."
519,0.002,2.0000,"Despite continued progress in the development of novel antiretroviral therapies, it has become increasingly evident that drug-based treatments will not lead to a functional or sterilizing cure for HIV(+) patients. In 2009, an HIV(+) patient was effectively cured of HIV following allogeneic transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from a CCR5(-/-) donor. The utility of this approach, however, is severely limited because of the difficulty in finding matched donors. Hence, we studied the potential of HIV-resistant stem cells in the autologous setting in a nonhuman primate AIDS model and incorporated a fusion inhibitor (mC46) as the means for developing infection-resistant cells. Pigtail macaques underwent identical transplants and Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) challenge procedures with the only variation between control and mC46 macaques being the inclusion of a fusion-inhibitor expression cassette. Following SHIV challenge, mC46 macaques, but not control macaques, showed a positive selection of gene-modified CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood, gastrointestinal tract, and lymph nodes, accounting for >90% of the total CD4(+) T-cell population. mC46 macaques also maintained high frequencies of SHIV-specific, gene-modified CD4(+) T cells, an increase in nonmodified CD4(+) T cells, enhanced cytotoxic T lymphocyte function, and antibody responses. These data suggest that HSC protection may be a potential alternative to conventional antiretroviral therapy in patients with HIV/AIDS. "
7777,0.002,2.0000,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
3911,0.002,2.0000,"The simultaneous presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes has become common in communities with the growth of the pandemic. As a consequence, the potentiality for an increased frequency of HIV-1 mixed infections caused by viruses of distinct subtypes could be expected. Thus, there is a need to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype as well as coinfections caused by two or more HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. To address this need, we have developed a genetic method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to screen for these two types of infections within infected populations. In this assay, restriction enzymes may be used to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1 infected samples. A 297 bp pol fragment spanning the entire viral protease gene and a 311 bp fragment of the p24 gag region are used for this analysis. The viral regions are amplified by nested PCR using DNA templates from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or virus culture. Classification of HIV-1 strains to well defined subtypes B, D, F, and A/C is done by sequential endonuclease restriction analysis of a PCR amplified-protease gene followed by analysis of the p24 gag region. The electrophoretic migration patterns visualized by ethidium bromide staining or by radiolabeled probes are then determined on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype, a single restriction pattern is detected, whereas in multiple infections caused by two or more viral strains of different subtypes, the combination of different digestion patterns are observed in infected individuals. Using this methodology we have screened for genetic variations in HIV-1 proviral DNA from thirty-three Brazilian samples. Our RFLP procedure classified thirty-two samples as single infections caused by viruses of subtypes B (31) and F (1), and one sample as dual infection caused by distinct viral strains. Subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the viral protease gene in lymphocytes of all these patients confirmed our RFLP findings in single infections, and demonstrated the existence of two distinct HIV-1 strains of subtypes F and D in a patient which lymphocytes showed the simultaneous presence of two different digestion patterns. As up to now, single infections caused by subtype D variants were not identified in Brazil, our data provide the first evidence of subtype D HIV-1 in this country. Because sequencing of HIV proviral DNA is not particularly practical for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies, the protease/gag-based RFLP screening method will be useful to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1, and to identify multiple infections caused by HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. We believe that this information is crucial for both evaluation of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic and intervention strategies."
2619,0.002,2.0000,"The antiretroviral chemotherapy helps to reduce the mortality of HIVs infected patients. However, RNA dependant virus replication has a high mutation rate. Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 protease plays an essential role in viral replication cycle. This protein is an important target for therapy with viral protein inhibitors. There are few works using normal mode analysis to investigate this problem from the structural changes viewpoint. The investigation of protein flexibility may be important for the study of processes associated with conformational changes and state transitions. The normal mode analysis allowed us to investigate structural changes in the protease (such as flexibility) in a straightforward way and try to associate these changes with the increase of fitness for each positively selected HIV-1 mutant protease of patients treated with several protease inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, and tripanavir) in combination or separately. These positively selected mutations introduce significant flexibility in important regions such as the active site cavity and flaps. These mutations were also able to cause changes in accessible solvent area. This study showed that the majority of HIV-1 protease mutants can be grouped into two main classes of protein flexibility behavior. We presented a new approach to study structural changes caused by positively selected mutations in a pathogen protein, for instance the HIV-1 protease and their relationship with their resistance mechanism against known inhibitors. The method can be applied to any pharmaceutically relevant pathogen proteins and could be very useful to understand the effects of positively selected mutations in the context of structural changes."
9943,0.002,2.0000,"To assess the hypothesis that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) might mimic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allodeterminants and interact with T-cell receptors (TCRs) of alloreactive T-cells, we have done a preliminary analysis of the range of alpha beta TCR gene products in 16 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with normal CD4 counts and in 16 healthy HIV-1-negative controls. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies with a two-colour direct immunofluorescence method, we found a significant increase in the expression of the V beta 5.3 subfamily in the HIV-positive patient group compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Selected increase in expression of V beta sequences has been described in various autoimmune conditions and our findings raise the possibility that the immunopathological damage from HIV infection may be due to the induction of autoreactivity. If HIV does mimic MHC II, the normal immune response to the virus could represent an autoimmune process similar to graft-versus-host disease."
6451,0.002,2.0000,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
2298,0.002,2.0000,"Alcohol use may have a negative impact on the course of HIV disease and the effectiveness of its treatment. We studied patients with HIV who use alcohol and associated socio-demographic, health and psychosocial factors. Outcomes from this study may help in selecting patients from clinical practice with high-risk alcohol use and who are likely to benefit most from alcohol reduction interventions. In a cross sectional study in three primary health care clinics in Pretoria, South Africa, from January 2012 to June 2012, patients with HIV infection were interviewed and patients' medical files were reviewed to obtain data on levels of alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), patients' socio-demographic characteristics, HIV-related information, health related quality of life (WHOQoL-HIVBref), internalized AIDS stigma, symptoms of depression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, bi- and multivariate logistic regression models. A total of 2230 patients (1483 [66.5%] female) were included. The median age was 37 years (interquartile range 31-43), 99.5% were black Africans, 1975 (88.6%) had started ART and the median time on ART was 22 months (interquartile range 9-40). No alcohol was used by 64% of patients, 8.9% were low risk drinkers, 25.1% of patients were hazardous or harmful drinkers and 2.0% had possible alcohol dependence. In multivariate analysis high-risk drinking was positively associated with male gender, never being married, tobacco use, a higher score for the 'level of independence'-domain measured with the WHOQoL-HIVBref questionnaire, and with more depressive symptoms compared to low-risk drinking. This study shows a high prevalence of hazardous or harmful drinking in patients with HIV infection (especially men) attending primary health care clinics in South Africa. Routine screening for alcohol use should be introduced in these clinics and harm reduction interventions should be evaluated, taking into account associated factors."
9648,0.002,2.0000,"Cigarette smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but findings regarding the association between cigarette smoking and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts have been inconsistent. This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."

Oligonucleotides composed of simple repetitive sequence motifs, including (GACA)4, (GATA)4, (GGAT)4, (GTG)5, and (GT)8, all yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation of 8 C. tropicalis isolates, 12 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata isolates, 8 atypical Candida isolates, and, except for (GATA)4, 2 C. krusei probe in turn and so generate several distinct DNA fingerprints of the same DNA sample. However, none of the probes yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation with three C. parapsilosis isolates. The (GATA)4 probe was also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms among a genetically closely related group of atypical Candida isolates on primary isolation from an additional HIV-infected patient. These chlamydospore-positive atypical Candida isolates were sucrose positive, were of C. albicans serotype A, hybridized weakly with the C. albicans-specific mid-repeat sequence probe 27A, and yielded fingerprint profiles by random polymorphic DNA analysis that were distinct from those derived from C. albicans isolates. The C. stellatoidea ex-type strain NCPF 3108 was indistinguishable from the atypical Candida isolates in all these tests and also yielded an identical carbohydrate and nitrogen source assimilation profile by using the ID 32C yeast identification system."
8192,0.002,2.0000,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."
7719,0.002,2.0000,"Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remains a leading cause of death for African-American women from 25 to 34 years of age. Depressive symptoms are commonly associated with the diagnosis of AIDS. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is needed for optimal treatment; however, African-American women who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who experience depressive symptoms have low and/or inconsistent use of HAART. Additionally, behaviors associated with untreated depressive symptoms increase the chances for HIV transmission. Clinicians, therefore, need to recognize both the individual and the contextual factors that influence those seeking treatment for depressive symptoms. The purpose of this article is to gain a better understanding of the factors that shape treatment seeking for depressive symptoms among HIV-positive African-American women, an important variable in secondary HIV prevention. Multi-contextual underpinnings shape this phenomenon; therefore, Bronfenbrenner's ecological framework was used to organize this literature review. Knowledge gained from this paper can support the promotion of health and can prevent or manage depressive symptoms among this vulnerable group."
6873,0.002,2.0000,"The biological dynamics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia in uremic patients with chronic infection have not been fully characterized. We prospectively studied fluctuations of HCV-RNA in sera from 52 patients with end-stage renal disease who were undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and had chronic HCV infection. We measured HCV viremia monthly over the course of 13 months with the branched-chain DNA (bDNA) signal amplification assay and prospectively analyzed liver function, expressed by monthly serum aspartate (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determinations. We observed three different patterns of HCV viremia: (1) patients persistently positive by bDNA assay (persistent viremia; 23 of 52 patients; 44%), (2) individuals with alternatively positive and negative results (intermittent viremia; 17 of 52 patients; 33%), and (3) patients persistently negative by bDNA assay (12 of 52 patients; 23%). The HCV viral load over the follow-up was greater among patients with persistent compared with intermittent viremia (persistent, 31.7 x 10(5) Eq/mL; range, 6.3 x 10(5) to 16.03 x 10(6) Eq/mL versus intermittent, 10.4 x 10(5) Eq/mL; range, 1.1 x 10(5) to 9.4 x 10(6) Eq/mL; P = 0.0001). In addition, patients with persistent viremia had over time greater AST and/or ALT activities than the intermittent group (AST: persistent, 26.5 IU/L; range, 9.6 to 73.7 IU/L versus intermittent, 21.3 IU/L; range, 8 to 56.8 IU/L; P = 0.001 and ALT: persistent, 14.7 IU/L; range, 3.7 to 57.9 IU/L versus intermittent, 10.9 IU/L; range, 2.3 to 52.1 IU/L; P = 0.001). In the group with persistent viremia, the mean difference between maximum and minimum values of HCV-RNA observed in each individual patient was 2.09 +/- 0.7 natural logarithm (Log(n)) and in intermittent viremic patients, 1.55 +/- 1 Log(n) (P = 0.045). The HCV load at study entry (19.4 x 10(5) Eq/mL) was rather low and did not change versus the end of follow-up in all patients (P = not significant [NS]). In the entire group, the fluctuations in HCV-RNA levels over time between and within individuals were not significant (P = NS). No difference in variability of HCV-RNA values over time between patients infected with different HCV genotypes was seen. In conclusion, three different patterns of HCV viremia in HD over time were assessed; one third of viremic patients had intermittent viremia, and those patients had less HCV-RNA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and aminotransferase activity than did patients with persistent HCV load. Larger fluctuations in HCV RNA levels occurred in patients with persistent than with intermittent HCV viremia. However, the viremic HCV load was low and relatively stable over a 13-month follow-up in our population. Studies with longer observation periods are warranted to understand fully the natural history of HCV in these immunosuppressed individuals."

Using cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells, which represent primary targets in sexual transmission, we demonstrated that blocking integration with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly L-870812, could consistently block cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection. In a pretreatment setting in which the compound was present before and during infection and was afterwards gradually diluted during the culture period, the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870812 blocked infection with the cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 Ba-L strain at concentrations of, respectively, 1,000 and 10,000 nM. The potency of L-870812 was similar to that of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor R-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) but one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC781 and TMC120. In contrast, the diketo acid RDS derivative InSTIs showed clear-cut but weaker antiviral activity than L-870812. Moreover, L-870812 completely blocked subtype C and CRFO2_AG primary isolates, which are prevalent in the African heterosexual epidemic. Furthermore, the addition of micromolar concentrations of L-870812 even 24 h after infection could still block both cell-free and cell-associated Ba-L, opening the prospect of postexposure prophylaxis. Finally, an evaluation of the combined activity of L-870812 with either T20, zidovudine, PMPA, UC781, or TMC120 against replication-deficient HIV-1 Ba-L (env) pseudovirus suggested synergistic activity for all combinations. Importantly, compounds selected for the study by using the coculture model were devoid of acute or delayed cytotoxic effects at HIV-blocking concentrations. Therefore, these findings provide evidence supporting consideration of HIV-1 integration as a target for microbicide development."
6806,0.002,2.0000,"Baseline HIV-1 resistance data are important for resistance monitoring purposes especially in regions initiating large-scale antiretroviral treatment programs. We examined 40 protease and 35 reverse transcriptase amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype C from drug inexperienced patients from rural settings in South Africa for resistance mutations. Samples were collected between 2001 and 2004 prior to the availability of antiretrovirals through public health institutions. Ninety-five percent of patients had no major mutations in the protease gene, although substitutions M46L (2.5%) and G73S (2.5%), which according to the Stanford Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm are considered major mutations, were detected. In addition, a high prevalence of minor mutations was observed in the protease, with at least three minor resistance-associated mutations in 37% of the isolates. An isoleucine insertion at codon 37 was detected in one sequence. Most of the RT sequences were wild-type, although V118I (8.5%) and Y318F (5.7%) associated with resistance to lamivudine and nevirapine, respectively, were observed. Our data suggest that major resistance mutations among the drug-inexperienced population in South Africa may be rare, and routine resistance testing before the initiation of therapy in this initial stage of the treatment program may not be necessary."
4393,0.002,2.0000,"We investigated the prevalence of HIV-1-associated transmitted drug resistance (TDR) in Victoria from the time of first availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Drug resistance genotyping was performed on virus present in blood samples collected from individuals with serologically confirmed primary infection, between 1996 and 2007. The significance of any mutations detected was interpreted according to a standardised list of drug resistance mutations. The main outcomes measured were the prevalence by year of TDR to any antiretroviral drug class, the numbers of infected individuals with TDR involving multiple drug classes, and the resistance mutations implicated in all cases. There was an average annual prevalence of TDR of 16%, predominantly associated with nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and most commonly occurring at codons 41, 103 and 215 in the RT. The prevalence of thymidine-associated mutations remained high throughout the period of study. While mutations known to cause resistance to protease inhibitors were uncommon, they were present in several individuals infected with virus resistant to multiple drug classes. The prevalence of TDR in Victoria is similar to geographical locations outside Australia where HIV-specific drug treatment is widely available. Primary infection with drug resistant HIV is a future treatment issue for the individual patient and for the wider population at risk of infection. At this time TDR shows no sign of waning and our data support recent treatment guidelines recommending baseline testing for TDR before therapy is initiated."
7141,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment, a significant cause of morbidity, affects up to 30% of HIV-infected people. Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an ""asymptomatic cognitively impaired"" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and ""asymptomatic,"" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions."
3335,0.002,2.0000,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
4145,0.002,2.0000,"CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."
7273,0.002,2.0000,"The use of all potent drugs is associated with toxicities and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are no exception. Antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic toxicity is of increasing concern in the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Liver toxicity has been reported in some HIV-infected patients being treated with drugs from all of these classes of ARV drugs: protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Although the majority of cases involve asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), severe, and, in a minority of cases, life threatening, liver disease has been reported in patients treated with ARV drugs. The exact causes of elevated plasma levels of AST and ALT are complex and, in many cases, obscure. The combination of viral hepatic disease, drugs that act adversely directly on the liver and drugs that act on other systems of the body which in turn, adversely affect the liver, can result in hepatic toxicity. Such toxicity may be inappropriately attributed solely to the direct effect of a drug. Knowledge of the possible causes of liver toxicity, and ways to avoid it, should reduce the risk of developing hepatotoxicity. The physician's task is to prevent the development of liver toxicity, e.g., by choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens and by careful management of the patient. This involves frequent monitoring of the patient, both clinically and by utilizing liver function tests on a regular basis. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do develop, prompt and expert management is essential. This review discusses the influence of a number of factors on hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, insulin resistance and the specific ARV drugs used in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS."
6431,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B infection is one of the infectious diseases quite common in Turkey and around the world. Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem which may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine, a significant progress has been made in the prevention of HBV infections. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of the individuals included in the risk group who admitted to our vaccination clinic, as well as their immune responses following the vaccination. Among the patients admitted to the vaccination clinic of our hospital between January 2003-December 2005 and that were included in the risk group (patients who have family members with chronic Hepatitis B infection, healthcare workers, hemodialysis patients etc.), those who were included in the vaccination program by examining the results of HBs Ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics (age, gender, smoking etc.) and results of Anti-HBs score. A total of 958 people were included in the vaccination program. Upon evaluation in terms of risk factors, presence of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection in the family was found to be 80.6% (772/958), being healthcare worker was 9.2% (88/958), HCV positivity and chronic liver disease was 3.0% (29/958), being a hemodialysis patient was 2.8% (27/958), and being an oncology patient was 2.1% (20/958). Post-vaccination immune response could be evaluated in 69.8% (669/958) of patients and no responsiveness to vaccine was detected only in 8.1% (54/669) of them. Of the non-responders, 64.8% (35/54) were hemodialysis and oncology patients. Anti-HBs positivity rate following hepatitis B vaccination program was found compatible with the results of previous studies. With this vaccine of considerably high effectiveness, immunization of the entire community including primarily the risk groups should be targeted."
8267,0.002,2.0000,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
9715,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. Until recently, interferon (IFN)-alpha was the only approved drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The recent registration of lamivudine, a dideoxycytidine analogue that inhibits both the HIV and HBV reverse transcriptases, has provided new perspectives for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Lamivudine treatment for 12 months leads to a control of viral replication during therapy in the majority of the patients and to sustained anti-hepatitis B e (anti-HBe) seroconversion in 16 to 22% of the patients, associated with a biochemical and histological response. Further studies showed that extended lamivudine therapy increases the rate of anti-HBe seroconversion. However, long-term therapy is associated with the progressive emergence of drug resistant mutants. In most cases these mutants are not associated with a deterioration of the liver disease within the available follow-up. In the remaining patients and in particular settings such as liver transplantation, a severe exacerbation of the liver disease is observed and that requires add-on therapy. Lamivudine treatment of patients infected with a pre-core mutant also showed beneficial effect with the control of viral replication, and a biochemical and histological response in approximately 60% of the patients at 1 year. These patients face the same problem of drug resistant mutants, and the optimal duration of lamivudine treatment still needs to be determined in this clinical situation. Moreover, lamivudine therapy is the only therapeutic option in decompensated cirrhotic patients to allow liver transplantation, and in liver transplant patients with HBV recurrence following transplantation. Adverse effects of lamivudine therapy are comparable to those observed in placebo-treated patients. ALT flares have been observed mainly in relation to the re-occurrence of viral replication due to the rebound of viral replication after therapy withdrawal, or to the emergence of drug resistance mutants. Therefore, lamivudine provides a new treatment alternative for patients with chronic HBV infection. For each patient, its indication has to be weighed against the risk of developing viral resistance but also against the risk of natural history of the disease."
6848,0.002,2.0000,"Melanins are pigments found in hair, skin, irides of the eye, and brain. Their functions in mammals include protection from exposure to sunlight, camouflage from predators, sexual recognition within species, and possible electron transfer reactants. Most natural melanins exist in an insoluble form, which is one reason there is little information on the biological properties of soluble melanins. Here, synthetic soluble melanins were obtained by chemical oxidation of L-tyrosine or spontaneous oxidation of L-beta-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). Replication of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) was inhibited by soluble melanin in two human lymphoblastoid cell lines (MT-2 and H9) and in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human T cells. Effective concentrations of 0.15-10 micrograms/ml had no cell toxicity. Melanin blocked infection by cell-free virus and interfered with HIV-induced syncytium formation and cytopathic effects when fusion-susceptible, uninfected cells, were mixed with chronically infected cells. Melanin also impeded the HIV-1 envelope surface glycoprotein, and T cell specific monoclonal antibody leu-3a (CD4), but not leu-5b (CD2), from binding to the surface of MT-2 cells. No effect on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity in viral lysates was observed. These results identify a unique biological property of melanin, and suggest that soluble melanins may represent a new class of pharmacologically active substances which should be further investigated for potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)."
9637,0.002,2.0000,"Since 1996, AIDS has declined in the Italian population, but cases in foreign patients, including both recent immigrants and long-term residents, have increased from 3.9% in 1995-1996 to 15.4% in 2001-2002. This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3). No significant difference was found for gender, country of origin, risk factor, and years of Italian residence, while legal immigrants (p = 0.018) and registered in the National Health Service (p = 0.014) were significantly more likely to receive HAART compared to illegal immigrants."
5104,0.002,2.0000,"Multiple inhibitory receptors may play a role in the weak or absent CD8+ T-cell response in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Yet few receptors have been characterized in detail and little is known about their complex regulation. In the present study, we investigated the role of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-related receptor CD244 and of programmed death 1 (PD-1) in HBV infection in 15 acutely and 66 chronically infected patients as well as 9 resolvers and 21 healthy controls. The expression of CD244, PD-1, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) was analyzed in virus-specific CD8+ T-cells derived from peripheral blood or liver using major histocompatibility complex class I pentamers targeting immunodominant epitopes of HBV, Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), or influenza virus (Flu). In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed higher levels of CD244 both in the peripheral blood and liver in comparison to the acute phase of infection or following resolution. CD244 was expressed at similarly high levels in EBV infection, but was low on Flu-specific CD8+ T-cells. In chronic HBV infection, high-level CD244 expression coincided with an increased expression of PD-1. The inhibition of the CD244 signaling pathway by antibodies directed against either CD244 or its ligand CD48 resulted in an increased virus-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity as measured by the expression of CD107a, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in CD8+ T-cells."
4289,0.002,2.0000,"Despite chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB) being a leading cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer, HBV evolution during CHB is not fully understood. Recent studies have indicated that virus diversity progressively increases along the course of CHB and that some virus mutations correlate with severe liver conditions such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Using ultradeep sequencing (UDS) data from an intrafamilial case, we detected such mutations at low frequencies among three immunotolerant patients and at high frequencies in an inactive carrier. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the HBV population from the seroconverter patient underwent many genetic changes in response to virus clearance. Together, these data indicate a potential use of UDS for developing non-invasive biomarkers for monitoring disease changes over time or in response to specific therapies. In addition, our analyses revealed that virus clearance seemed not to require the virus effective population size to decline. A detailed genetic analysis of the viral lineages arising during and after the clearance suggested that mutations at or close to critical elements of the core promoter (enhancer II, epsilon encapsidation signal, TA2, TA3 and direct repeat 1-hormone response element) might be responsible for a sustained replication. This hypothesis requires the decline in virus load to be explained by constant clearance of virus-producing hepatocytes, consistent with the sustained progress towards serious liver conditions experienced by many CHB patients.

206,0.002,2.0000,"The HIV lipodystrophy syndrome, a condition characterized by subcutaneous fat loss sometimes associated with relative or absolute accumulation of central fat, has a high prevalence in the treatment of HIV infection. Associated metabolic alterations include peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased free fatty acids, and decreased HDL. Often, these metabolic abnormalities appear or deteriorate before the manifestation of fat redistribution. Hypertriglyceridemia is the leading lipid abnormality after initiation of HIV therapy frequently observed together with low HDL cholesterol. Raised levels of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been found in these patients, and there are reports about hypertension associated with antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV therapy resembles a clinical situation that is known as the ""metabolic syndrome"" in HIV-negative patients. There is now good evidence that the metabolic abnormalities of HIV-infected patients harbor a significant risk for cardiovascular disease with as yet unknown consequences. In addition, several studies report a reduced quality of life in patients with body habitus changes leading to reduced therapy adherence. Current data indicate a rather multifactorial pathogenesis where HIV infection, its therapy, and patient-related factors are major contributors. Therapeutic and preventive strategies have, so far, been of only limited or no success. For reduction of the cardiovascular risk, recommendations proposed for non-HIV-infected patients like the National Cholesterol Education Program (NECP) have been adapted for HIV-infected patients. These should be regarded as rather preliminary and need to be evaluated in further clinical trials. General recommendations include dietary changes and physical activity, switch of antiretroviral drugs (replacement of protease inhibitors), and, finally, use of metabolically active drugs. Lipid-lowering agents can be considered for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevated LDL, or a combination of both. Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, however, share common hepatic metabolization pathways with protease inhibitors (cytochrome P450 3A4 system), thereby potentially leading to additional liver and muscle toxicity. Although clinicians should assess cardiovascular risk factors and target risk reduction in HIV-infected patients, the primary goal in HIV therapy remains to be the effective suppression of viral replication leading to reduced morbidity and mortality."
463,0.002,2.0000,"The clinical spectrum of AIDS and changes of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are rarely described in the less developed countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We prospectively observed on a follow-up basis 309 HIV-infected patients (82.8% with AIDS) at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan, where highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been provided to all patients at no charge at any stage of HIV infection since April 1, 1997, to describe the spectrum of HIV-associated opportunistic diseases and evaluate changes of morbidity and mortality from June 24, 1994 through June 23, 1999. Of the patients, 59.3% at study entry had a CD4+ lymphocyte count of <50 cells/microliter. The five leading HIV-associated opportunistic infections included oroesophageal candidiasis (195 patients), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (93), tuberculosis (77), mucocutaneous herpes simplex infection (74), and cytomegalovirus diseases (73). The incidence rates of seven major AIDS-defining opportunistic diseases were declining though the changes of the relative proportions varied. The median duration of hospitalization decreased from 36 days in 1995 to 12 days in 1999 (p =.0001). Overestimated mortality rate declined from 148.4 per 100 patient-years in 1995 to 7.4 per 100 patient-years in 1999 (p =.0001) whereas the underestimated mortality rate declined from 110.5 to 5.39 per 100 patient-years (p =.0001). Risk ratio (RR) for mortality in patients who received HAART compared with those who did not was 0.410 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.249-0.674; p =.0004) and the RR was 0.250 (95% CI, 0.127-0.492; p =.0001) when the analysis was limited to patients with an initial CD4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/microliter and follow-up duration >30 days after adjusting for their age, gender, type of risk behavior, and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Morbidity and mortality were declining with each study year even in a population consisting mainly of patients at the advanced stage of HIV infection in Taiwan. Earlier diagnosis, accumulation of clinical experience, and use of HAART were associated with lower mortality rates."
311,0.002,2.0000,"Atazanavir is the first once-daily protease inhibitor for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and should be used only in combination therapy, as part of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen. In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."
8495,0.002,2.0000,"Proviral human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA could be a useful marker for exploring viral reservoirs and monitoring antiretroviral treatment, particularly when HIV-1 RNA is undetectable in plasma. A new technique was developed to quantify proviral HIV-1 using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. One copy of proviral HIV-1 DNA could be detected with 100% sensitivity for five copies and the assay had a range of 6 log(10). Reproducibility was evaluated in intra- and interassays using independent extractions of the 8E5 cell line harboring the HIV-1 proviral genome (coefficients of variation [CV], 13 and 27%, respectively) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a patient with a mean proviral load of 26 copies per 10(6) PBMC (CV, 46 and 56%, respectively). The median PBMC proviral load of 21 patients, measured in a cross-sectional study, was determined to be 215 copies per 10(6) PBMC (range, <10 to 8,381). In a longitudinal study, the proviral load of 15 out of 16 patients with primary infection fell significantly during 1 year of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.004). In the remaining patient, proviral HIV-1 DNA was detectable but not quantifiable due to a point mutation at the 5' end of the TaqMan probe. No correlation was observed between proviral load and levels of CD4(+) cells or HIV-1 RNA in plasma. TaqMan PCR is sensitive and adaptable to a large series of samples. The full interest of monitoring proviral HIV-1 DNA can now be ascertained by its application to the routine monitoring of patients."
8508,0.002,2.0000,"We and others have shown that in individual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 is influenced by host immune competence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in addition to selective forces operating within the host, transmission bottlenecks have an impact on HIV-1 intrahost evolution. Therefore, we studied the intrahost evolution of the V3 region of the external glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 during the 3- and 5-year periods following seroconversion after parenteral versus sexual (male-to-male) transmission in 41 participants of the Amsterdam prospective cohorts of homosexual men (n = 31) and intravenous drug users (IVDUs; n = 10) who were AIDS free and had comparable numbers of CD4+ cells. We observed that HIV-1 strains in homosexual men accumulated over 5 years more nonsynonymous substitutions within the V3 loop than HIV-1 strains in IVDUs as a result of lower rates of nonsynonymous evolution in both the initial 3-year period from seroconversion and the following 2-year period as well as a larger proportion of nonsynonymous back substitutions in IVDUs. The mean numbers of synonymous substitutions did not differ between the two risk groups. Since HIV-1 strains in IVDUs could be distinguished from the viruses of homosexual men based on several nucleotide substitutions of which the most conserved is a synonymous substitution at the tip of the V3 loop (GGC pattern), we studied whether the founder virus population itself has an impact on the intrahost evolution of HIV-1. The mean number of nonsynonymous substitutions accumulated over 5 years within the V3 loop was lower in 10 IVDUs infected by the HIV-1 strains with the GGC signature than in 4 IVDUs infected by HIV-1 strains lacking this pattern, while the mean numbers of synonymous substitutions were similar in the two groups."
9402,0.002,2.0000,"Following interruption of antiretroviral therapy among individuals with acquired drug resistance, preexisting drug-sensitive virus emerges relatively rapidly. In contrast, wild-type virus is not archived in individuals infected with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thus cannot emerge rapidly in the absence of selective drug pressure. Fourteen recently HIV-infected patients with transmitted drug-resistant virus were followed for a median of 2.1 years after the estimated date of infection (EDI) without receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV drug resistance and pol replication capacity (RC) in longitudinal plasma samples were assayed. Resistance mutations were characterized as pure populations or mixtures. The mean time to first detection of a mixture of wild-type and drug-resistant viruses was 96 weeks (1.8 years) (95% confidence interval, 48 to 192 weeks) after the EDI. The median time to loss of detectable drug resistance using population-based assays ranged from 4.1 years (conservative estimate) to longer than the lifetime of the individual (less conservative estimate). The transmission of drug-resistant virus was not associated with virus with reduced RC. Sexual transmission of HIV selects for highly fit drug-resistant variants that persist for years. The prolonged persistence of transmitted drug resistance strongly supports the routine use of HIV resistance genotyping for all newly diagnosed individuals."
2631,0.002,2.0000,"There is a low risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for HCW through exposure in the work place. The mean risk of infection with HIV after a percutaneous exposure is 0.3%. This risk can be considerably higher depending on various factors: for example, a deep percutaneous injury or the source patient being in an end stage of HIV infection. Despite compliance with adequate precautions, it is not always possible for HCW to avoid injuries. This fact has made intervention desirable after such exposure. Zidovudine (AZT) was available as the first effective drug for treatment of HIV infection. Also, animal experiments have shown efficacy in prophylactic use of zidovudine. Therefore, since the beginning of the 90's, there has been an increased use of postexposure prophylaxis with zidovudine for exposed HCW, and during this period of use more evidence has come up to show the efficacy of PEP. In fact, a large retrospective case-control study showed a 81% reduction of HIV transmission to exposed HCW in the zidovudine treated group after percutaneous exposure. Based upon this impressive evidence and other data which indicate the efficacy of PEP, postexposure prophylaxis has become a standard procedure in the health care setting after a significant exposure to HIV. A combination of three antiretroviral drugs, usually including a protease inhibitor, is used today. Based on our current pathogenetic understanding, PEP should be started as soon as possible after exposure to HIV. There are effective tools for preventing HIV transmission in the general population. However, these tools do not provide universal protection: rupture of condoms, needle sharing and unprotected intercourse with a HIV infected person are situations at risk of HIV transmission. In spite of a different mode of exposure when compared to the health care setting, PEP in timely application is believed to be efficacious. To date there is no controlled data to support PEP in such situations; however, PEP with a combination of antiretroviral drugs after anal, oral (with ejaculation) or vaginal intercourse and needle sharing with a HIV-positive partner is recommended for a minimum of two weeks. There are reservations in recommending PEP after unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner of unknown serostatus."
3310,0.002,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common and often asymptomatic. Antibodies against HCV are a highly sensitive marker of infection. Molecular testing for HCV is used to confirm a positive result on antibody testing and to provide prognostic information for treatment; however, quantitative HCV RNA does not correlate with disease severity or risk for progression. Chronic HCV infection is most frequently associated with remote or current intravenous drug use and blood transfusion before 1992, although as many as 20% of infected patients have no identifiable risk factor. In an estimated 15% to 20% of persons infected with HCV, the infection progresses to cirrhosis; alcohol intake is an important cofactor in this progression. Most specialists prefer to include an examination of liver histology in the management of patients with chronic HCV infection to aid prognostic and treatment decisions. The current standard of pharmacologic treatment of chronic HCV is weekly subcutaneous peginterferon in combination with daily oral ribavirin, which results in sustained virologic response in approximately 55% of chronically infected patients. Side effects of interferon therapy include myalgias, fever, nausea, irritability, and depression. The cost-effectiveness of interferon therapy is similar to that of many commonly accepted medical interventions. The primary care physician serves a vital role in identifying patients with chronic HCV infection, educating patients about risk factors for transmission, advising patients about the avoidance of alcohol, and aiding patients in making treatment decisions."
8200,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health problem and one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Co-infection with HCV and HIV occurs frequently, mainly because both viruses share the same transmission routes. In recent years, the life expectancy of patients with HIV disease has been increased due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Furthermore, several studies have established that HIV infection is associated with a major progression of the HCV-related liver disease. Thus, end-stage liver disease has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, emphasising the importance of treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons. The biological and histological benefit of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) therapy in patients co-infected with HCV/HIV is not significantly different from that noted in similar patients without HIV when the HIV infection is adequately controlled. However, patients with low CD4+ cell counts tend to respond poorly to anti-HCV therapy.Given the relatively low sustained virological response rate to IFN alone, the use of IFNalpha monotherapy has been largely abandoned in favour of combination therapy with ribavirin. In the last 2 years, IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy has been the standard care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Although information on the safety and efficacy of this dual therapy in HCV/HIV co-infected patients is scarce, recent trials have reported that the combination of IFN plus ribavirin is well tolerated and feasible in patients co-infected with HCV/HIV. However, the rates of sustained virological response seem to be worse than those observed in patients without HIV infection. New IFN formulations (e.g. pegylated interferon) plus ribavirin appear to be way of the future for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients both with and without HIV co-infection."
8938,0.002,2.0000,"Many regions within the envelope of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that affect its structure and function have been identified. We have previously reported that the interaction of the second conserved (C2) and third variable (V3) regions of gp120 influences the ability of HIV-1 to establish a productive infection in susceptible cells. To better understand the basis for this interaction, we have conducted structure-function analyses of envelope expressed from molecular proviral clones of HIV-1 containing defined mutations in C2 and V3 that individually and in combination differentially affect envelope function. The substitution of a glutamine for an asparagine residue (Q-267) at a potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site in C2, which severely impairs virus infectivity, reduces intracellular processing of gp160 into gp120, the association of gp120 with virions, and the ability of gp120 to bind to the HIV-1 cell surface receptor protein, CD4. The change of an arginine to an isoleucine codon in V3 (I-308), in the presence of the Q-267 mutation, restores virus infectivity to near wild-type levels by increasing the amount of gp120 associated with virions as compared with the Q-267 mutant but does not compensate for the Q-267-induced processing defect. The I-308 change in the context of the wild-type HIV-1 has no affect on processing, association, or CD4 binding. These results indicate that the impaired infectivity of the Q-267 mutant virus is due to a marked reduction in the amount of virion gp120 and suggest that the interaction of C2 and V3 stabilizes the association of gp120 with gp41."
8311,0.002,2.0000,"Since modulation of the glutathione (GSH) level has been implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and expression, we have undertaken an analysis of the effect of sodium valproate (VPA) on HIV-1 replication. VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."
3872,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers maintain undetectable levels of viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but their underlying immunological and virological characteristics may vary. Here, we used a whole-genome transcriptional profiling approach to characterize gene expression signatures of CD4 T cells from an unselected cohort of elite controllers. The transcriptional profiles for the majority of elite controllers were similar to those of ART-treated patients but different from those of HIV-1-negative persons. Yet, a smaller proportion of elite controllers showed an alternative gene expression pattern that was indistinguishable from that of HIV-1-negative persons but different from that of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-treated individuals. Elite controllers with the latter gene expression signature had significantly higher CD4 T cell counts and lower levels of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cell responses but did not significantly differ from other elite controllers in terms of HLA class I alleles, HIV-1 viral loads determined by ultrasensitive single-copy PCR assays, or chemokine receptor polymorphisms. Thus, these data identify a specific subgroup of elite controllers whose immunological and gene expression characteristics approximate those of HIV-1-negative persons."
6318,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurring in a boy who was 6 years 2 months old is reported. The patient is thought to have been infected with HBV by exchange blood transfusion (horizontal infection) in the neonatal period. Jaundice appeared eight months after birth. He was subsequently treated and follow-up with a diagnosis of hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen (Ag)-positive chronic persistent hepatitis. His mother and other family members were HBsAg-negative. Postmortem examination revealed a multinodular growth of hepatocellular carcinoma of trabecular and solid pattern, mainly of the right lobe, complicated with mild fibrosis of the liver. Numerous HBsAg-positive hepatocytes demonstrated by orcein staining and the indirect immunoperoxidase method were present in the noncancerous area. This hepatocellular carcinoma is considered to have occurred within six years two months after HBV infection and not to have been associated with liver cirrhosis. The present case may be valuable for assessing the oncogenic properties of HBV and the incubation period of HBV infection before it develops into hepatocellular carcinoma."
3694,0.002,2.0000,"This pilot study was conducted to determine areas in which additional education regarding the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is needed by the undocumented and recently immigrated HIV-infected population, and to obtain preliminary information on the ability of this community to access medical treatment for HIV. Information regarding health status, immigration status, and the use of medical services was obtained from all HIV-infected undocumented and recently immigrated individuals who sought services from a Southern California nonprofit agency between July 1, 1990 and December 31, 1990. A total of 54 such individuals presented for services. Thirteen individuals reported participating in shared needle usage for the administration of medication or vitamins, in addition to other known risk factors for HIV. Only one of these 13 individuals had access to nonemergency medical care. Additional research is necessary to determine the reasons for these needle sharing behaviors. Educational outreach is needed to address these behaviors as a possible risk factor for HIV transmission."
9492,0.002,2.0000,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."
8635,0.002,2.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common in resource-limited settings but is frequently not diagnosed. The authors retrospectively tested specimens for HBV in HIV-infected Thai women who had participated in an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical study. A substantial proportion (27 of 211; 13%) of HIV-infected women were HBV coinfected. Among HIV/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact. "
8606,0.002,2.0000,"CSF protein and cellular profiles were studied in 28 HIV-infected patients. Twenty of them had neurological complaints, but only 6 patients had objective neurological deficits such as dementia, ocular motility disorders or polyneuropathy. The serum/CSF HIV antibody ratio was on average lowest in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (4 patients) and highest or almost normal in lymphadenopathy syndrome (LAS) (11) and asymptomatic seropositivity (ASX) (7), while it varied between these extremes in AIDS-related complex (ARC) (6). However, low values of the ratio were also found in the HIV-infected patients free of neurological symptoms and even in one ASX patient. The CSF IgG index was elevated in all these 4 general stages of HIV infection without any significant differences between them. The CSF/serum albumin ratio was slightly increased in patients with neurological deficits, but this ratio showed no association with any other clinical factor analysed. CSF leucocytes were increased in the early stages of the disease, but later the cellular reaction subsided. HIV was isolated from post mortem brain tissue of two AIDS patients and from the CSF of one of them. The results suggest increased intrathecal virus-specific IgG synthesis, not only in patients with neurological deficits and at advanced stages of infection, but also in neurologically symptom-free subjects and at early infection. The lack of correlation between the increased virus-specific IgG synthesis within the CNS and the presence of neurological symptoms suggests that neurologically ""silent"" areas of brain white matter are often affected in HIV infection."
2142,0.002,2.0000,"Until recently, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was considered an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation in Spain. We present the first 4 cases of liver transplantation (LT) carried out in our center in patients infected with HIV and coinfected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), immunosuppressed with cyclosporine A (CyA) and basiliximab, but without steroids. The 4 patients were male, with a mean age of 38.25 +/- 4.5 years. Mean time of HIV infection was 114 +/- 62.3 months and all patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HCV genotypes of the 4 patients were 4, 1b, 1b, and 1a. Two patients were classified as Child-Turcotte-Pugh C (10 and 11 points), 1 was B (8 points), and the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma was A (5 points). Immunosuppression consisted of basiliximab and monotherapy with CyA. There were no postoperative infections. With a follow-up of 17 +/- 8 months, all patients are alive. There was only 1 acute rejection episode, and this was solved with steroid pulses. Three patients showed HCV recurrence with enzymatic and histological changes and were treated with interferon and ribavirin. One patient had negative HCV-ribonucleic acid after 6 months of treatment. In conclusion, HIV infection should not be considered an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation. The evolution of this type of patients will probably depend on the HCV infection. Immunosuppression without steroids may reduce opportunistic infection."
1182,0.002,2.0000,"Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
1523,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and viral antigens were simultaneously identified by immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections followed by in situ hybridisation. In the developed radioautographs, silver grains indicate the location of viral DNA in the cell and the immunohistochemical stain marks sites of accumulation of viral antigen. In liver from a patient with chronic active hepatitis serologically positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen (HBsAg/HBeAg) viral nucleotide sequences, representing actively replicating DNA species, were demonstrated predominantly in the cytoplasm. Viral core antigen (HBcAg) was expressed in the liver cell nuclei. HBcAg was not detectable in most hepatocytes with high levels of viral replication. Conversely, most liver cells in which HBcAg was found did not contain replicating HBV. HBcAg and replicating viral DNA species were not detectable in hepatocytes undergoing pathological changes, such as ground glass cells. Because no pathological changes could be identified either in hepatocytes with high levels of HBV replication or expression of nuclear HBcAg, the liver cell damage in this patient with chronic hepatitis B was presumably induced by other mechanisms. The simultaneous observation of viral DNA, antigens, and pathological changes at the single cell level and their correlation with clinical findings should contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HBV-induced liver cell injury."
5483,0.002,2.0000,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env. To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression, demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype, developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4 phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24 demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels. These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4 phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and that multiple domains contribute to this process."
9923,0.002,2.0000,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
9267,0.002,2.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) replication in infected individuals. Unfortunately, patients remain persistently infected owing to the establishment of latent infection requiring that ART be maintained indefinitely. One strategy being pursued involves the development of latency-reversing agents (LRAs) to eliminate the latent arm of the infection. One class of molecules that has been tested for LRA activity is the epigenetic modulating compounds histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACis). Previously, initial screening of these molecules typically commenced using established cell models of viral latency, and although certain drugs such as the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid demonstrated strong activity in these models, it did not translate to comparable activity with patient samples. Here we developed a primary cell model of viral latency using primary resting CD4+ T cells infected with Vpx-complemented HIV-1 and found that the activation profile using previously described LRAs mimicked that obtained with patient samples. This primary cell model was used to evaluate 94 epigenetic compounds. Not surprisingly, HDACis were found to be the strongest activators. However, within the HDACi class, the most active LRAs with the least pronounced toxicity contained a benzamide functional moiety with a pyridyl cap group, as exemplified by the HDACi chidamide. The results indicate that HDACis with a benzamide moiety and pyridyl cap group should be considered for further drug development in the pursuit of a successful viral clearance strategy."
9724,0.002,2.0000,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
1536,0.002,2.0000,"To determine the clinical characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients undergoing interferon-free antihepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy, we examined HBV DNA in 25 HBV co-infected patients and 765 patients with resolved HBV infection during and after treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Among those with HCV genotype 1, asunaprevir plus daclatasvir was administered to 160 patients, sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir to 438 patients and paritaprevir plus ombitasvir and ritonavir to 25 patients. In total, 167 patients with genotype 2 were treated with SOF plus ribavirin. Three patients with an HBV DNA level ≥2000 IU/mL were treated with entecavir before anti-HCV therapy, without reactivation of HBV. In 3 of 22 (12%) HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with an HBV DNA level <2000 IU/mL, the viral load increased during treatment. However, hepatitis flare did not occur in these patients. There was no significant difference in clinical history between patients with and without HBV reactivation. Among 765 patients with resolved HBV infection, HBV reactivation occurred in 1 (0.1%) patient after initial resolution, whose HBV DNA level spontaneously decreased after DAA therapy. We compared anti-HBs titres at baseline with those at post-DAA therapy in 123 patients without HBsAg. There was no significant difference in anti-HBs levels between the two points (P = .79). In conclusion, HBV reactivation was rare in HBsAg-negative patients treated with DAA therapy. Additionally, hepatitis did not occur in HBV-reactivated patients with a baseline HBV DNA level <2000 IU/mL before DAA therapy."
948,0.002,2.0000,"Lamivudine, a novel cytosine analogue, exhibits potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. The standard HBV DNA hybridization assay used in phase II clinical studies has a low sensitivity, the detection limit of HBV DNA levels being approximately 10(7) genome equivalents per ml (geq ml-1). In this work we used a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (detection limit approximately 10(3) geq ml-1) to determine HBV DNA levels during a 24-week study of lamivudine in 51 stable chronic hepatitis B patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Patients were randomly allocated to receive oral doses of 25, 100 or 300 mg lamivudine once daily. At week 24 the median serum concentration of HBV DNA had fallen from 10(8) to 10(4) geq ml-1, a 4-log median reduction. A trend towards more profound suppression of viral replication with an increased dose of lamivudine was observed. After 12 weeks of therapy, 12% of patients had an HBV DNA level that was undetectable in the PCR assay; this increased to 26% after 24 weeks, while in an additional 20% of patients, HBV DNA decreased to the level of detection of the PCR assay. We conclude that a 24-week course of lamivudine decreases serum HBV DNA to the level of PCR detection in 46% of patients. Such additional viral suppressive activity with higher doses and more protracted lamivudine may be of clinical utility prior to liver transplantation. Further studies are needed to define the degree of virus suppression required in clinical practice, and methods are required to increase the efficacy of virus suppression."
661,0.002,2.0000,"Seven hundred and four HIV-1/2-positive, antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve patients were screened for HTLV-1 infection. Antibodies to HTLV-1 were found in 32/704 (4.5%) of the patients. Each co-infected individual was matched with two HIV mono-infected patients according to World Health Organization clinical stage, age +/-5 years and gender. Key clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Mono-infected and co-infected patients displayed similar clinical characteristics. However, co-infected patients had higher absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.001), higher percentage CD4+ T-cell counts (P < 0.001) and higher CD4/CD8 ratios (P < 0.001). Although HIV plasma RNA viral loads were inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell-counts in mono-infected patients (P < 0.0001), a correlation was not found in co-infected individuals (P = 0.11). Patients with untreated HIV and HTLV-1 co-infection show a dissociation between immunological and HIV virological markers. Current recommendations for initiating ART and chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in resource-poor settings rely on more readily available CD4+ T-cell counts without viral load parameters. These guidelines are not appropriate for co-infected individuals in whom high CD4+ T-cell counts persist despite high HIV viral load states. Thus, for co-infected patients, even in resource-poor settings, HIV viral loads are likely to contribute information crucial for the appropriate timing of ART introduction."
3807,0.002,2.0000,"HIV-1 extrachromosomal 2-LTR circles (cc2LTR) are rapidly lost in dividing cell populations and, therefore, might be interpreted as representing new infection and ongoing viral replication. However, recent work demonstrated that cc2LTR persist in infected, growth-arrested T cell lines beyond their predicted half-life as previously determined in dividing cell populations. In this study, the evaluation of the stability of cc2LTR was extended to include primary human macrophages, a natural, non-dividing target of HIV-1. By quantitative real-time PCR, cc2LTR were found to persist out to 21 days post-infection in macrophages infected with both integrase competent and integrase- defective, recombinant HIV-1, whereas in activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes, they rapidly decreased over time. This persistence was associated with persistent, low level expression of the indicator gene, luciferase. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1 cc2LTR in the PBMC of HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive HAART could be due either to ongoing generation of newly infected dividing cells, or persistence of circles in non-dividing cell populations where they appear to be stable. Furthermore, exrachromosomal circular DNA in this cell population could be a source of persisent viral protein expression."
7735,0.002,2.0000,"Autoantibodies to the CD4 protein, which serves as a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the surface of target cells, were found in patients with different stages of HIV disease. Using recombinant soluble CD4 (rCD4) antigen in a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we detected serum anti-CD4 antibodies in approximately 20% of HIV-1 infected patients and 13% of HIV-2 infected patients. There was no correlation between the presence of anti-CD4 antibodies and the stage of HIV disease, serum IgG concentration, number of peripheral blood CD4 positive lymphocytes, or CD4/CD8 lymphocyte ratios in HIV-1 infected patients. Immunoaffinity purified anti-CD4 antibody failed to bind to CD4 positive cells using flow cytometric analysis. However, this antibody could weakly bind to CD4 positive cells that had been preincubated with purified recombinant gp120 (rgp120). In addition, using an ELISA system, we found that the binding of purified patient anti-CD4 antibody to rCD4 was increased in the presence of rgp120. Similar increased binding was observed with the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4, but not with anti-Leu3a. These data suggest that a conformational change in the C-terminal domains of CD4 may be induced by gp120 binding and could lead to development of anti-CD4 antibodies."
8524,0.002,2.0000,"Comorbidities in human immunodeficiency virus infection are of great interest due to their association with unfavorable outcomes and failure of antiretroviral therapy. This study evaluated the prevalence of coinfection by human immunodeficiency virus and viral hepatitis in an endemic area for hepatitis B in the Western Amazon basin. Serological markers for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis D virus were tested in a consecutive sample of all patients referred for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The variables sex, age, origin and exposure category were obtained from medical records and from the sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome surveillance database. Among 704 subjects, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B carriage was 6.4% and past infection 40.2%. The presence of hepatitis B was associated with birth in hyperendemic areas of the Amazon basin, male sex and illegal drug use. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C was 5% and was associated with illegal drug use. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients in the Western Amazon basin was lower than seen elsewhere and is probably associated with the local epidemiology of these viruses and the degree of overlap of their shared risk factors. An opportunity presents itself to evaluate the prevention of hepatitis C through harm reduction policies and hepatitis B through vaccination programs among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients."
540,0.002,2.0000,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
7572,0.002,2.0000,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."
4951,0.002,2.0000,"Substantial differences have been described in the response of individual patients to zidovudine (ZDV) therapy, both in the clinical impact and in virus load. Genotypic changes associated with the appearance of drug resistance may also be different or occur at different rates. We have obtained the nucleotide sequence of the RT domain of individual HIV-1 genomes extracted from 10 plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples donated by two haemophiliac patients before, during, and after long-term ZDV therapy. Although the plasma virus load was similar throughout, the order and timing of appearance of resistance-associated substitutions differed in the two patients. In patient p74, K70R appeared after 4 months, T215Y at 5.5 months, and M41L at 13 months. In p87, K70R also appeared at 4 months, but T215Y and K219Q were not observed until 18 months and M41L not at all. Much greater sequence change overall occurred in p74. The evolution of the viral population in that patient was dominated by the unique appearance of T215Y and subsequently M41L, with all sequences from the last time point being descended by a single path from the pretreatment samples. However, in p87, several different lineages of RT sequences were found to persist throughout treatment. We propose that these differences in outcome may be determined by differences in genetic background at sites other than the five generally considered to be associated with ZDV sensitivity."
7560,0.002,2.0000,"The objective of this study was to identify parameters among saquinavir pharmacokinetics, patients' demographics or comedications, to be addressed for improved personalized therapy. The presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA at therapy week 48 (principal target parameter), CD4 cell count at week 48, infections and side effects during 48 weeks, indicators of liver toxicity and lipid abnormalities at week 48, and a 12-h saquinavir plasma concentration-versus-time profile were assessed in 56 patients receiving saquinavir-ritonavir (1,000 and 100 mg, respectively) twice daily (44 therapy-naïve and 12 antiretrovirally pretreated patients) for association with saquinavir plasma concentrations, demographics, baseline values of target parameters, and coadministered antiretrovirals. Antiretroviral failure was observed in 8 of the 56 patients in whom HIV-1 RNA was detectable at week 48. This therapeutic failure was not associated with individual saquinavir pharmacokinetics. More likely, therapeutic failure was related to incidences interfering with antiretroviral therapy, causing therapy interruptions or incompliance. Weak associations were, however, seen between high maximum saquinavir plasma concentrations and both CD4 counts of > or =200 cells microl(-1) at week 48 (P = 0.014) and constitutional side effects during 48 weeks (P = 0.002). However, patients with high CD4 counts and constitutional side effects were not identical (P = 0.53). Saquinavir therapeutic drug monitoring in patients infected with protease inhibitor-susceptible HIV-1 taking saquinavir-ritonavir (1,000 and 100 mg, respectively) is not demanded for improving the antiretroviral effect. It may be contemplated in cases with constitutional side effects or low CD4 counts with weak immune responses."
8350,0.002,2.0000,"Virologic failure, or the inability to maintain or achieve viral suppression below detectable limits (<50 copies/mL), occurs in some patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, despite being on a potent antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. Current guidelines state that the goal of therapy is to achieve and maintain HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels, with recommendations to switch regimens upon virologic failure based on the adverse consequences of higher degrees of viremia. With the introduction of potent, newer agents, the likelihood of achieving this goal in treatment-experienced patients is growing. Not all patients who experience virologic failure while on therapy suffer from immediate virologic and immunologic decline; some experience persistently low, but detectable, levels of HIV-1 RNA in the range of 50-1000 copies/mL. The threshold at which low-level viremia (LLV) becomes predictive of disease progression varies between studies, although evidence shows that incomplete viral suppression leads to the accumulation of resistance mutations with a concomitant increase in viral replication, reduction in CD4 cell counts, increased risk of virologic progression, and clinical deterioration. Furthermore, with increasing resistance, future treatment options are compromised. Although there are clinical consequences when a patient is maintained on a failing regimen, it may be preferable to delay a switch in therapy if the chance for resuppression is low. With the introduction of new ARVs within existing classes that have shown significant activity against resistant virus, as well as the introduction of two new classes of ARV agents, HIV treatment has entered a new era. The options for constructing regimens active against multidrug-resistant virus have expanded."
1330,0.002,2.0000,"Tenofovir is a nucleotide acting both as an inhibitor of human immunodeficiency (HIV) reverse transcriptase and as a competitor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA-directed DNA polymerase. Approved worldwide in 2001, tenofovir is used as a component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients with HIV infection. Since 2008, it has also been indicated for treatment of chronic HBV infection or HIV/HBV co-infection. The aim of the treatment consists in suppressing viral replication, thus reducing hepatic complications and improving patient survival. Furthermore, tenofovir could represent an effective therapeutic option in lamivudine-resistant HBV patients. Tenofovir is eliminated unchanged through urine via glomerular filtration (80%) and proximal tubular secretion (20%). Thus, alterations in renal clearance may interfere with tenofovir pharmacokinetics and systemic drug concentrations, modifying the therapeutic response. Hence, a renal overload of tenofovir in patients with a pre-existing kidney impairment could result in a worsening of renal function. Following a brief introduction on HBV infection and its therapeutic options, we review the latest evidence, to our knowledge, on renal toxicity of tenofovir in HBV patients and on drug management."

The only triphosphate found in cells incubated with 1592U89 was that of the guanine analog (-)-carbovir (CBV). However, the in vivo pharmacokinetic, distribution, and toxicological profiles of 1592U89 were distinct from and improved over those of CBV, probably because CBV itself was not appreciably formed from 1592U89 in cells or animals (<2%). The 5'-triphosphate of CBV was a potent, selective inhibitor of HIV-1 RT, with Ki values for DNA polymerases (alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon which were 90-, 2,900-, 1,200-, and 1,900-fold greater, respectively, than for RT (Ki, 21 nM). 1592U89 was relatively nontoxic to human bone marrow progenitors erythroid burst-forming unit and granulocyte-macrophage CFU (IC50s, 110 microM) and human leukemic and liver tumor cell lines. 1592U89 had excellent oral bioavailability (105% in the rat) and penetrated the CNS (rat brain and monkey cerebrospinal fluid) as well as AZT. Having demonstrated an excellent preclinical profile, 1592U89 has progressed to clinical evaluation in HIV-infected patients."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
2080,0.002,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) possesses the ability to establish a complete infection in nondividing host cells. The capacity of HIV-1 to infect nondividing cells probably contributes significantly to its pathology in vivo, as reflected by infection of peripheral T lymphocytes, tissue macrophages, and microglial cells. However, the in vitro demonstration of the establishment of stable HIV-1 infection in quiescent T cells remains controversial. We have developed a primary T-cell model of acute HIV-1 infection of quiescent CD4 lymphocytes that demonstrates the development of a complete, reverse-transcribed form of virus that is stable for over 10 days in culture. To ensure that our primary cell culture was representative of a quiescent population, the CD4 lymphocyte targets were monitored for membrane expression of activation antigens and for shifts in cell cycle from G0/G1 to S/G2 phase. The presence of viral DNA fragments reflecting progressive reverse transcription was determined by PCR analysis. HIV entered primary CD4 cells rapidly, but viral DNA accumulated slowly in the resting cell cultures. DNA species containing regions of full-length reverse transcription were not detected until 3 to 5 days after infection. In parallel with the appearance of complete viral DNA, spliced RNA transcripts, predominantly of the nef species, were detected by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification. When infected CD4 cells were sorted on the basis of cell cycle analysis of DNA content, the accumulation of a complete viral DNA form was found to occur in both the purified G0/G1-phase cell subset and the cell fraction enriched for the minor S-phase subset. In contrast, spliced viral RNA products could be detected only in the enriched S-phase cell fraction. These results demonstrate that HIV-1 can infect and establish a complete, stable form of viral DNA in primary CD4 lymphocytes in vitro but is blocked from transcription in the absence of cell activation. The findings are consistent with in vivo data from HIV-infected individuals that show the existence of viral DNA predominantly as a stable, extrachromosomal form in T cells of the peripheral circulation."
9994,0.002,2.0000,"AIMS To estimate the prevalence of cats testing positive for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigens in domestic cats entering a New Zealand animal shelter, based on a commercial point-of-care ELISA, to identify risk factors associated with cats testing positive, and to compare the results obtained from the ELISA with those obtained using PCR-based testing. METHOD A cross-sectional study was performed on 388 cats entering the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals animal shelter in Auckland, New Zealand between 7 February 2014 and 30 May 2014. Whole blood samples were collected from each cat and tested for FIV antibody and FeLV antigen using a commercial point-of-care ELISA. Information on the signalment and health status of the cat at the time of entry was also recorded. Blood and saliva samples from a subset of cats were tested for FIV and FeLV proviral DNA using a real-time PCR assay. RESULTS Of the 388 cats in the study sample, 146 (37.6%) had been relinquished by owners, 237 (62.4%) were strays, and 5 (1.3%) were of unknown origin. Overall, 53/388 (13.7%) cats tested positive for FIV antibodies and 4/388 (1.0%) were positive for FeLV antigen. Stray cats had a higher FIV seroprevalence than relinquished cats (42/237 (17.8%) vs. 11/146 (7.5%); p=0.008). Of 53 cats that were FIV-seropositive, 51 (96%) tested positive for FIV proviral DNA using PCR testing of blood. Of these 51 cats, 28 (55%) were positive by PCR testing of saliva. Of the four cats that were FeLV antigen-positive by ELISA, two (50%) were positive for FeLV proviral DNA by PCR testing of blood. The odds of a cat being seropositive for FIV were greater for intact compared to desexed cats (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.6-7.4) and for male compared to female cats (OR=6.5; 95% CI=3.2-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE The seroprevalence for FIV was 14% among cats entering an animal shelter in Auckland, whereas the prevalence of FeLV antigen-positive cats was only 1%. These findings suggest differences in the transmission dynamics of each virus in free-roaming cat populations in New Zealand. Our study also highlights the potential role of desexing cats in reducing transmission of FIV. However, further data from first-opinion veterinary practices are required to confirm that these findings may be generalised to the wider domestic cat population in New Zealand."
7051,0.002,2.0000,"Eight percent of the human genome is composed of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which are thought to be inactive remnants of ancient infections. Previously, we showed that individuals with early HIV-1 infection have stronger anti-HERV T cell responses than uninfected controls. In this study, we investigated whether these responses persist in chronic HIV-1 infection and whether they have a role in the control of HIV-1. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 88 subjects diagnosed with HIV-1 infection for at least 1 year (median duration of diagnosis, 13 years) were tested for responses against HERV peptides in gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. Individuals who control HIV-1 viremia without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had stronger and broader HERV-specific T cell responses than HAART-suppressed patients, virologic noncontrollers, immunologic progressors, and uninfected controls (P < 0.05 for each pairwise comparison). In addition, the magnitude of the anti-HERV T cell response was inversely correlated with HIV-1 viral load (r(2) = 0.197, P = 0.0002) and associated with higher CD4(+) T cell counts (r(2) = 0.072, P = 0.027) in untreated patients. Flow cytometric analyses of an HLA-B51-restricted CD8(+) HERV response in one HIV-1-infected individual revealed a less activated and more differentiated phenotype than that stimulated by a homologous HIV-1 peptide. HLA-B51 tetramer dual staining within this individual confirmed two different T cell populations corresponding to these HERV and HIV-1 epitopes, ruling out cross-reactivity. These findings suggest a possible role for anti-HERV immunity in the control of chronic HIV-1 infection and provide support for a larger effort to design an HIV-1 vaccine that targets conserved antigens such as HERV."
8182,0.002,2.0000,"The proposed study is a Phase I trial to evaluate a HIV-based lentiviral vector carrying an antisense sequence targeted to HIV in the treatment of HIV infection. The primary objective of this Phase I study is to determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with autologous CD4+ T cells modified (transduced) ex vivo with VRX496 when administered to HIV-infected patients. VRX496 is a completely gutted lentiviral vector and does not code for any viral proteins. The viral vector contains an antisense sequence targeted to the HIV envelope (env) gene. VRX496 directly interferes with wild-type HIV (wt-HIV) expression via anti-env antisense expression in vector transduced CD4 cells that become infected with wt-HIV. Expression of the anti-HIV antisense env from a HIV vector transcript would target wt-HIV RNA and destroy it, and hence, decrease productive HIV replication from CD4 T cells. The clinical goal for this treatment approach is to decrease viral loads and promote CD4 T cell survival in vivo. Data from in vitro studies suggest that HIV vectors such as VRX496 could potentially reduce viral loads in HIV-infected individuals and thus could delay the onset to AIDS while promoting CD4 T cell survival and providing the immune system with a better chance to control the infection. Additionally, preliminary results from experiments in SCID mice (mice with transplanted human immune cells) indicate that the human cells transduced with VRX496 and implanted into the SCID mice do not elicit any overt adverse effects. HIV-infected patients (CD4 T cell count of >200/mm3, discontinued from HAART therapy) will undergo leukoapheresis with subsequent CD4 T cell isolation. Patient CD4 T cells will be transduced ex vivo with the vector, expanded for 8-11 days, and then the modified cells will be reintroduced into the patient. Each subject will receive a single intravenous injection infused over 30 minutes; subjects will be examined 24, 48, and 72 hours post-injection and weekly for 4 weeks. Patients will receive one of four different ascending doses (1 x 10(9), 3 x 10(9), 1 x 10(10), and 3 X 10(10) cells/patient). Doses will be administered to four independent, sequential subject cohorts of 3 patients. Groups will be administered escalating doses at 6-week intervals after safety has been demonstrated in the previous group. Follow-up examinations will be conducted 1, 3, and 6 months post-injection. Long term follow-up including RCR testing will be performed."
7203,0.002,2.0000,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."
1447,0.002,2.0000,"A large percentage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have serological evidence of a past or present hepatitis B virus infection (HBV). Long-term survival is increasing for HIV patients because of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, the chronic hepatitis B infection may become an important determinant of disease outcome in these co-infected patients. We describe two HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were treated with extended antiviral therapy, initially indicated for the HIV infection. Lamivudine, a suppressor of viral replication in both infections, was one of these antiviral drugs. One patient showed a severe rebound of the HBV after withdrawal of lamivudine, the other patient developed a mutant hepatitis B virus after 18 months of treatment. This mutation was exclusively induced by lamivudine. These patients show that, with improved HIV-related survival, the HBV infection should be monitored carefully, thereby enabling the physician to interfere with therapy when necessary."
4645,0.002,2.0000,"Among many factors that can influence vulnerability to infection and disease progression are genetic host factors together with the phenotype/genotype of the transmitting virus and the route of infection. Each of these factors alone or in combination could determine susceptibility to infection and subsequent rate of progression towards AIDS. Between host genetic factors identified and analyzed for their role in HIV-1 transmission and disease progression are polymorphisms in the genes encoding chemokine receptors and CCR5, CCR2 and SDF-1 a natural ligand for CXCR4 receptor. It has been shown that the distribution of this genetic polymorphisms and their role in the course of disease varies between different racial, ethnic and risk groups. The aim of present study was to examine the frequencies of polymorphic alleles CCR5-delta32, CCR2-64I and SDF-1-3'A and their role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transmission in Polish population. The allelic and genotype distribution was studied in 103 HIV-1 infected patients (group HIV+) and 59 seronegative participants (group HIV-). Genotyping was done by the use of polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers and restriction fragment length polymorphism. We found higher prevalence of CCR5-delta32 mutant allele among seronegative participants (13.6%) compared with HIV-infected patients (9.7%), although this did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.29). The CCR2-64I allelic frequency was almost identical in the HIV- and HIV+ groups (12.7% vs. 12.6%; respectively; p = 0.98). In contrast, the SDF-1-3'A allelic frequency was slightly lower among seronegative participants (15.3%) compared with HIV-infected patients (16.5%), and observed difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.77). Furthermore, we found that the genotype or allelic frequencies among HIV-1 infected patients were independent on the participant's sex, age at HIV-1 infection and the transmission route. Our results showed no significant differences in the prevalence of examined alleles and genotypes between HIV-1 infected patients and seronegative participants, which indicates that in the examined population they are not influencing host susceptibility to the HIV-1 infection."
7342,0.002,2.0000,"With the observation of the occurrence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among leprosy patients in our pilot study carried out in Tamil Nadu, South India, a case-control study was planned to explore whether HIV infection is a risk factor for leprosy and to understand the characteristics of HIV infection and high-risk behaviors among leprosy patients. We screened 556 patients and 1004 nonleprosy controls (matching 502 cases for age, sex and area of residence) for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. They also were interviewed for personal information on history of blood transfusion, intravenous drug abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, and sexually transmitted diseases. Of the 1019 total cases screened (of both pilot and extended studies), 5 were found to be position for HIV antibodies (HIV-1 = 4, HIV-2 = 1); of the 1019 nonleprosy controls, 6 were positive for HIV-1 antibodies. An analysis by odds ratio revealed no association between leprosy and HIV infection (OR = 0.824, 95% CI = 0.201-3.593). A strong association was found only between high-risk behavior and HIV infection (OR = 5.186, 95% CI = 1.717-15.667). However, unmarried, unmarried after 30 years of age, exposure to spouses of the leprosy patients, and a history of surgery were all observed to be significantly more common among leprosy patients than the controls."
8960,0.002,2.0000,"Serum or liver markers of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection were found in 20 of 22 (90%) Italian patients presenting with an ostensible type B hepatitis that ran an accelerated course to cirrhosis. The features of the illness conformed to a syndrome of HDV infection in young males carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); a latent HBsAg state was documented in many patients by a history of prior exposure to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or by the absence of IgM antibodies to the HB core antigen. Characteristic of the disease were the clinical overture as a severe hepatitis, the lobular involvement by an extensive necroinflammatory reaction, the exuberant expression of intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen and an atypical HBV profile of inactive infection or accelerated seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe. Superimposed upon HBV infection, HDV may create a rapidly progressive course which resembles very aggressive hepatitis B but is infrequently observed in hepatitis B alone."
7933,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) intrauterine infection remains to be an important cause for a large number of persistent hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive carriers in areas with a high HBV prevalence, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. In this study, the possible association between the HBV genomic heterogeneity and intrauterine infection was investigated by comparing the quasi species isolated from eight pairs of HBsAg-positive mothers and their neonates, who were infected intrauterinely with HBV, with clones from eight HBsAg-positive mothers whose neonates were not infected with HBV. The proportion of clones with specific mutations was compared among different subject groups, and phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the significance of specific mutations. It was observed that the core promoter with conserved major functional regions and conserved hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) might be beneficial to HBV maternal-fetal transmission. Particularly, A1762T/G1764A mutations seemed to be disadvantageous for fetal infection. It was also shown that amino acid substitutions located in the immune epitopes of HBsAg were strongly associated with intrauterine HBV transmission. The clones with mutations such as amino acid P110S in preS1 region, P36L in preS2 region and C107R in S region might infect fetuses more readily. In addition, positively selected site analysis confirmed the above results."
9671,0.002,2.0000,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."
428,0.002,2.0000,"The first step in infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the specific binding of gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV, to its cellular receptor, CD4. To inhibit this interaction, soluble CD4 analogues that compete for gp120 binding and block HIV infection in vitro have been developed. To determine whether these analogues can protect an uninfected individual from challenge with HIV, we used the chimpanzee model system of cell-free HIV infection. Chimpanzees are readily infected with the IIIB strain of HIV-1, becoming viraemic within about 4-6 weeks of challenge, although they do not develop the profound CD4+ T-cell depletion and immunodeficiency characteristic of HIV infection in humans. CD4 immunoadhesin (CD4-IgG), a chimaeric molecule consisting of the N-terminal two immunoglobulin-like regions of CD4 joined to the Fc region of human IgG1, was selected as the CD4 analogue for testing because it has a longer half-life than CD4, contributed by the IgG Fc portion of the molecule. In humans, this difference results in a 25-fold increased concentration of CD4-IgG in the blood compared with recombinant CD4. Here we report that pretreatment with CD4-IgG can prevent the infection of chimpanzees with HIV-1. The need for a preventative agent is particularly acute in perinatal HIV transmission. As recombinant CD4-IgG, like the parent IgG molecule, efficiently crosses the primate placenta, it may be possible to set up an immune state in a fetus before HIV transfer occurs, thus preventing infection."
1647,0.002,2.0000,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."
6990,0.002,2.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) is one of the most significant risk factors for viral hepatitis (B, D and C) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, there is little information about the risk of infection among non-injection drug users (non-IDUs). The present study was designed to perform several objectives: (a) to evaluate the prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B, D, C virus and HIV in IDU and non-IDU patients; (b) to compare the prevalence of these markers between both groups; (c) to identify risk factors for HCV and HIV in this population; and (d) to correlate the presence of HCV and liver function. A total of 385 consecutive patients (122 IDUs and 263 non-IDUs), admitted to the Drug Dependency Treatment Unit at the Hospital Insular of Gran Canaria between 1993 to 1994, were included in the study. The serological markers of HBV, HDV, HCV and HIV were determined by ELISA and immunoblot methods. In all cases we also measured syphilis tests (RPR and FTAabs), serum aminotransferases and serum gammaglutamiltranspeptidase. Compared to the non-IDU, the IDU group presents a higher prevalence of antiHBc (55.0% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001), antiHCV (87.6% vs. 35.3%, p < 0.0001) and antiHIV (21.8% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in RPR positivity (0.9% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.06). Delta infection was only detected in injection drug users, and the prevalence was low. Using logistic regression, the only risk factors associated with antiHCV positivity were injection drug addiction (OR: 9.2, 95% CI: 4.9-17.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 3.0-9.9). Similarly, the associated risk factors for HIV were injection drug addiction (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 2.3-15.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.2). However, no correlation was found between antiHCV positive and antiHIV or between these markers and RPR positivity. Patients positive for antiHCV showed significant elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, when compared with patients negative for antiHCV: 65.0 vs. 39.2 U/l (p < 0.001) and 88.4 vs. 40.3 U/l (p < 0.001), respectively. We conclude that drug users have an elevated prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV infection, even if drug use is only inhalated. On the other hand, the main risk factors associated with HCV and HIV are injection drug addiction and exposure to hepatitis B virus. Finally, in the study population, liver dysfunction is closely related to HCV infection."
2351,0.002,2.0000,"While patients with liver disease are known to have a higher prevalence of glucose intolerance, preliminary studies suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may be an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes mellitus. To further study the correlation of HCV infection and diabetes, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1,117 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and analyzed whether age, sex, race, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HCV infection, and cirrhosis were independently associated with diabetes. In addition, a case-control study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of HCV infection in a cohort of 594 diabetics and 377 clinic patients assessed for thyroid disease. In the former study after the exclusion of patients with conditions predisposing to hyperglycemia, diabetes was observed in 21% of HCV-infected patients compared with 12% of HBV-infected subjects (P =.0004). Multivariate analysis revealed that HCV infection (P =.02) and age (P =.01) were independent predictors of diabetes. In the diabetes cohort, 4.2% of patients were found to be infected with HCV compared with 1.6% of control patients (P =.02). HCV genotype 2a was observed in 29% of HCV-RNA-positive diabetic patients versus 3% of local HCV-infected controls (P <.005). In conclusion, the data suggest a relatively strong association between HCV infection and diabetes, because diabetics have an increased frequency of HCV infection, particularly with genotype 2a. Furthermore, it is possible that HCV infection may serve as an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes, beyond that attributable to chronic liver disease alone."
5025,0.002,2.0000,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
3377,0.002,2.0000,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
8586,0.002,2.0000,"We studied the relation between the occurrence of adverse reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prophylaxis and the subsequent course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a cohort of homosexual men. Adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (P < .001) and death (P < .001) and with a more rapid decline in CD4+ cell counts (P = .001). The median time to progression to AIDS was 14.9 months in subjects with adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ and 32.5 months in those without adverse reactions. After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P = .004). A low CD4+ cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-4.28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.29-3.81). The relative hazards of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS with the exclusion of PCP and toxoplasmosis, CD4+ cell counts of <50/mm3, and death were 2.16 (95% CI, 1.25-3.72), 2.37 (95% CI, 1.36-4.12), and 3.21 (95% CI, 1.80-5.72), respectively. It is unclear whether adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ induce or merely predict progression of HIV disease."
1914,0.002,2.0000,"We have genetically engineered CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) specificity by inserting a gene, CD4zeta, containing the extracellular domain of human CD4 (which binds HIV env) linked to the zeta (zeta) chain of the T-cell receptor (which mediates T-cell activation). Twenty-four HIV-positive subjects received a single infusion of 2 to 3 x 10(10) autologous CD4zeta-modified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells administered with (n = 11) or without (n = 13) interleukin-2 (IL-2). Subjects had CD4 counts greater than 50/microL and viral loads of at least 1000 copies/mL at entry. T cells were costimulated ex vivo through CD3 and CD28 and expanded for approximately 2 weeks. CD4zeta was detected in 1% to 3% of blood mononuclear cells at 8 weeks and 0.1% at 1 year after infusion, and survival was not enhanced by IL-2. Trafficking of gene-modified T cells to bulk rectal tissue and/or isolated lamina propria lymphocytes was documented in a subset of 5 of 5 patients at 14 days and 2 of 3 at 1 year. A greater than 0.5 log mean decrease in rectal tissue-associated HIV RNA was observed for at least 14 days, suggesting compartmental antiviral activity of CD4zeta T cells. CD4(+) counts increased by 73/microL at 8 weeks in the group receiving IL-2. There was no significant mean change in plasma HIV RNA or blood proviral DNA in either treatment arm. This sustained, high-level persistence of gene-modified T cells demonstrates the feasibility of ex vivo T-cell gene therapy in HIV-infected adults and suggests the importance of providing HIV-specific T-helper function."
3093,0.002,2.0000,"Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma. In many instances, these lymphomas contain Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) genomes. To investigate the role of EBV in development of HIV-related lymphoma, benign fixed lymph node biopsies from normal individuals and HIV-infected individuals with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) were analyzed for EBV sequences by polymerase chain reaction and in situ DNA hybridization techniques. EBV DNA was not detected in any of 16 benign lymph node biopsies from normal individuals, but could be detected from 13 of 35 PGL biopsies. The EBV-infected cells were present in both follicular and interfollicular areas and in both small and large lymphoid cells. The presence of detectable amounts of EBV DNA in the 13 PGL biopsies was associated with an increased incidence of concurrent lymphoma at another site (n = 3) or development of lymphoma in time (n = 2). In contrast, only 1 of 22 individuals with EBV-negative PGL biopsies developed lymphoma in time (P less than .05). EBV was detected in all five lymphomas in which tissue was available for subsequent analysis, including the lymphoma that developed in the individual without EBV in his previous PGL biopsy. These findings support the hypothesis that EBV plays a role in development of some HIV-related lymphomas. Detectable EBV lymphoproliferations occur in a few PGL biopsies and are associated with a significant risk of EBV DNA-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
5923,0.002,2.0000,"The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and remarkable success in the treatment of paediatric HIV infection has changed the face of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in children from a fatal disease to that of a chronic illness. Many children living with HIV are surviving into adolescence. This sub-population of people living with HIV is emerging as a public health challenge and burden in terms of healthcare management and service utilization than previously anticipated. This article provides an overview of the socio-developmental challenges facing adolescents living with HIV especially in a resource-limited setting like Nigeria. These include concerns about their healthy sexuality, safer sex and transition to adulthood, disclosure of their status and potential stigma, challenges faced with daily living, access and adherence to treatment, access to care and support, and clinic transition. Other issues include reality of death and implications for fertility intentions, mental health concerns and neurocognitive development. Coping strategies and needed support for adolescents living with HIV are also discussed, and the implications for policy formulation and programme design and implementation in Nigeria are highlighted."
3146,0.002,2.0000,"We have previously observed an increased frequency of liver failure in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected hemophiliacs. The purpose of this study was to quantitate hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels in serial samples from HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and HIV-seronegative (HIV-) hemophiliacs before and after HIV seroconversion, and to examine the relationship of HCV RNA levels to CD4 cell counts and to hepatic dysfunction over time. HCV RNA levels were measured on serial samples of serum stored frozen from 17 HCV+/HIV+ and 17 HCV+/HIV- subjects matched within 5 years of their birth dates. All were HCV+ before study entry. HCV RNA levels were quantitated by a branched DNA-enhanced label amplification (bDNA) assay. For samples less than the cut off, HCV RNA was measured by the nested polymerase chain reaction. Individual changes over time, clinical groups, and mean values within predetermined time windows were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Mean HCV RNA levels increased from 2.76 (standard error [SE] 1.33) x 10(5) to 2.84 (SE 1.39) x 10(6) eq/mL during the first 2 years after HIV seroconversion (P = .006). Baseline HCV RNA levels in the pre-HIV seroconversion group were not significantly different from the baseline levels in those who remained HIV (P = .79). Over the entire period of study, HCV RNA levels increased nearly threefold in those who remained HIV- (mean 9.47 [SE 4.78] x 10(5) to 2.81 [SE 1.13] x 10(6)/mL; P = .02). Among those who became HIV+, HCV RNA levels increased 58-fold (mean 2.85 [SE 1.26] x 10(5) to 1.66 [SE 0.57] x 10(7) eq/mL; P = .0001). The rate of increase in HCV RNA levels was eightfold faster for HIV+ subjects than for subjects who remained HIV- (P = .009). HCV RNA levels increased twofold higher in 5 subjects who developed liver failure compared with the 12 who did not (P = .43). HCV RNA levels correlated significantly with CD4 counts (R = -.33, P = .01) and serum aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) (R = .36, P = .007). We conclude that HCV RNA levels are significantly higher in HIV+ than in HIV- multitransfused hemophiliacs. HCV load increases over time, is enhanced by HIV, and further increases as immune deficiency progresses. HCV RNA levels are directly associated with high AST levels. These findings suggest that HIV-induced immune deficiency may promote increased HCV replication."
9531,0.002,2.0000,"We assessed the impact of an efavirenz-containing regimen versus a protease inhibitor-containing regimen on quality of life, emotional status, and adherence of HIV-1-infected patients. In addition, we sought to define the adverse events associated with these treatments, with a special focus on central nervous system disorders in the efavirenz treatment group. This prospective, randomized, two-arm, controlled study included 100 patients for whom initial treatment with a protease inhibitor-containing regimen failed. Patients were randomized to start treatment with two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus efavirenz (group 1; 51 patients) or two nucleoside retrotranscriptase inhibitors plus one or more new protease inhibitors (group 2; 49 patients). Quality of life was assessed by a five-point item adapted from the HIV questionnaire of the Medical Outcomes Study, emotional status was evaluated by the Profile of Mood State questionnaire, and patients self-reported adherence. Data were analyzed by both an as-treated method and an intention-to-treat-last observation carried forward method. Patients in group 1 reported the following findings at week 4: dizziness (66%), abnormal dreaming (48%), light-headedness (37%), and difficulty sleeping (35%). At week 24, dizziness (13%; p <.001), abnormal dreaming (18%; p =.002), light-headedness (13%; p =.01), difficulty sleeping (7%; p =.001), and nervousness (13%; p =.01) decreased in these patients. Irritability, abnormal dreaming, and nervousness persisted at week 48 in 13%, 10%, and 8% of group 1 patients, respectively. Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 4: light-headedness (8%), dizziness (5%), difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (4%), and headaches (3%). Patients in group 2 reported the following findings at week 48: difficulty sleeping (4%), nervousness (3%), headaches (3%), and light-headedness (2%). In group 1, quality of life (p <.001) and emotional status (week 48; p =.004) improved, both of which were better than those in group 2 (p =.001). Both groups maintained high levels of medication adherence, and no significant differences in the number of patients who had viral loads of <200 copies/mL at week 48 were found (78% of group 1 patients vs. 85% of group 2 patients; p = not significant). At week 48, the mean CD4 cell count +/- SD was 497 +/- 224/mm3 in group 1 and 539 +/- 298/mm3 in group 2 (p = not significant). Despite similar immunologic and virologic outcomes, a second-line efavirenz-containing regimen improved quality of life of HIV-1-infected patients compared with a second-line protease inhibitor-containing regimen. However, close follow-up of patients receiving treatment with efavirenz-based regimens is recommended, especially for those with previous emotional disturbances due to central nervous system disorders in the short term and those with persistence of a low percentage of these disorders in the long term."
2019,0.002,2.0000,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
53,0.002,2.0000,"Recent analysis of antiretroviral treatment (ART) program data in Georgia showed that end-stage liver disease was a leading cause of death among HIV/HCV co infected patients in 2005. The objective of this retrospective study was to study prevailing genotypes and subtypes of HCV virus in a cohort of HIV infected patients. The investigation revealed that of 1490 patients, 879 (59%) were hepatitis C antibody positive. Detectable HCV RNA was found among 91% of patients. Median liver HCV RNA level was higher than among mono-infected patients. The most prevalent genotypes were genotype 1 (41.6%), followed by genotype 3 (34.7%) and genotype 2 (17.6%), inter (mix) genotype recombinants were found among 5.8 % of patients. The genotype distribution in our study is slightly different from what was seen in Georgia in 2000. The differences of prevailing HCV genotypes among general population and HIV co infected group was probably attributed to the different methods for sample selection used within our study or possible influence of diverse transmission networks among HIV infected group. Another explanation can be the possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the result of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Our study demonstrated high prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected patients and revealed 1b as predominant genotype. IDUs were less likely to spontaneously clear the virus than homosexual man and heterosexually infected woman. A greater HCV RNA levels were associated with a greater chance to be infected with HCV genotypes 1. Possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes can be of option. This shift may have a major and beneficial impact on treatment schedules and costs. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the results of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Study results highlights and strengthens the need for careful follow-up of HCV/HIV co infected patients, effective management and therapies against HCV in order to reduce liver related death rates in patients on ART."
6710,0.002,2.0000,"The last international consensus conference about hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment emphasized the importance of treatment for persons coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As liver biopsy precedes treatment, we aimed to identify factors associated with the performance of liver biopsy among HIV-HCV coinfected drug users during a 5-year follow-up to study their access to HCV treatment. Of the 296 patients followed in the HIV hospital departments of Nice and Marseilles and with retrievable records about HCV diagnosis and care, 166 were eligible for analysis having had detectable HCV RNA at least once during the study period. Overall, 45.2% of patients underwent liver biopsy during follow-up. Using proportional hazard models, predictors of having had a liver biopsy were high social support, complete abstinence from drug injection, and lack of immunosuppression as well as male gender, no history of multiple incarcerations, more recent onset of drug use, and an increase of liver enzyme levels. These results suggest that specific efforts should be devoted to HIV-HCV coinfected drug users to assist with stabilizing these patients to optimize their access to HCV care whenever possible."
9107,0.002,2.0000,"The evolution of treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has led to improved therapeutic efficacy. However, a major problem is the presence of side effects that require modification or withdrawal of drug therapy in 15-20% of cases. This could potentially influence the lack of sustained viral response in 50% of the cases. Side effects are common, even with pegylated interferon. This study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of infections based on the development of neutropenia associated with combined therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin in 209 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. All patients were administered pegylated interferon-alpha2a (180 microg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day for 24 weeks in cases of nongenotype 1, or 1000-1200 mg/day for 48 weeks for genotype 1, according to whether patients weighed more or less than 75 kg). Patients with preexisting neutropenia of any cause or cirrhosis were excluded. Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count (NC) of <1500 cells/microl. Neutropenia was classified into three levels during treatment: 750<or=NC<1500 (level 1), 500<or=750 (level 2), and NC<500 cells/microl (level 3). Of the 209 patients, 114 did not develop neutropenia (mean 2100+/-804 cells/microl), while 95 had an NC<1500 cells/microl (mean 1100+/-250 cells/microl). It was found that patients who developed neutropenia during treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection with a combined therapy based on pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin did not show a higher infection rate or increased severity of the disease."
5584,0.002,2.0000,"Hepatitis C recurrence is the main cause of graft loss in liver transplant patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HII). These patients have higher risk of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, which is the most severe type of hepatitis C recurrence. Until direct antiviral agents were released, only a minority of patients could be satisfactorily treated. We describe the successful treatment with pegylated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir of an hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV co-infected patient who developed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis after liver transplantation. A 40-year- old male (HCV genotype 1a; IL-28 CC) underwent liver transplantation for decompensated cirrhosis. On post-transplant day 60, he rapidly developed progressive jaundice, worsening of liver function tests and ascites. A transjugular liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Treatment with peglated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir was indicated for 48 weeks, achieving sustained virological response at 12 weeks of follow-up. The rapid negativization of the viral load observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment was associated with regression of ascites andjaundice. Red blood cell transfusions, erythropoietin and filgrastim were required for the management of anemia and neutropenia. Triple therapy with telaprevir might be indicated for the treatment of severe HCV recurrence in selected HCV/HIV co-infected patients, especially in countries with limited access to pegylated-interferon-free regimens."
4282,0.002,2.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection is a relevant period for its virological and epidemiological consequences. Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery."
3057,0.002,2.0000,"The woodchuck together with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of hepadnaviral infections. Chronic WHV infection causes severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks. The mechanism of viral clearance is not fully understood, interferons seem to play a major role in down-regulating viral replication prior to elimination of infected hepatocytes. We investigated on the pattern of cytokine and T-cell-marker expression in livers of woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. RNase-protection-assay (RPA) was used to determine mRNA of woodchuck specific genes (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-15, CD3, CD4, CD8). Serial liver biopsies were performed daily or weekly in eight chronic WHV-carrier woodchucks. Cytokine/T-cell-marker expression differed significantly between the time points up to +/-50% within each woodchuck. The different expression patterns of cytokines or T-cell-markers did not correlate to the (weak) fluctuations in the viremia but may explain the observed fluctuations in the WHV/HBV-load in chronically infected individuals. Furthermore, we observed associations between cytokine and T-cell-marker expression. The marginal fluctuations in viremia during the chronic infection may indicate, that, once the chronic hepadnaviral infection is established, cytokines/interferons expressed endogenously (i.e. not vector-borne or injected) play only a minor role."
3384,0.002,2.0000,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."
8279,0.001,1.0000,"From a cohort of 9621 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals, we identified 61 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCL) who had a median survival of 1.3 months. We compared clinicopathologic variables of patients who were treated in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HAART eras and investigated whether exposure to antiretroviral agents with differing cerebrospinal fluid penetrations was associated with risk for PCL. All statistical tests were two-sided. Incidence of PCL was lower in the HAART era (1.2 cases per 1000 patient-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8 to 1.9) than in the pre-HAART era (three cases per 1000 years, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.0; P<.001), and overall survival was longer (median survival = 32 days, range = 5-315 days, versus 48 days, range = 15-1136 days; log rank P = .03). In the HAART era, fewer patients had prior acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illnesses than in the pre-HAART era (64% versus 90%; P = .013), and patients were more likely to have the diagnosis of PCL confirmed histologically or by polymerase chain reaction (77% versus 26%; P<.001). Exposure to specific antiretroviral agents was not associated with risk for PCL."
969,0.001,1.0000,"To reduce unnecessary exposure to treatment, physicians must decide at an early stage whether continuation of treatment has a reasonable chance of success for the individual patient. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the previously described quantitative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) measurements vs quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA measurements for prediction of nonresponse and response in interferon (IFN)-alpha treated HBeAg positive chronic HBV patients. Serum HBV DNA and HBeAg levels were assessed at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. For each test (HBV DNA level at baseline, HBV DNA decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, or the combination of these two, as well as HBeAg level at baseline, HBeAg decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, and the combination of these two), we calculated the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. Monitoring with quantitative HBV DNA levels (area under ROC 0.87) was superior to monitoring with quantitative HBeAg levels (0.76, P < 0.05). Step-wise logistic regression identified HBV DNA at baseline and decrease in HBV DNA from baseline to week 12, as independent predictors of response. The overall test performance of predicting nonresponse (predictive value 100%) was best for log HBV DNA testing at week 12 compared with testing at week 8 due to a better prediction of sustained response (46%vs 38%) and lower misidentification of nonresponse (39%vs 54%). This study showed that quantitative HBV DNA testing at baseline in combination with a decrease between baseline and week 12 has a high predictive value for identifying patients who have virtually no chance of reaching a sustained response with IFN therapy."
1580,0.001,1.0000,"The HIV-1 regulatory proteins Tat and Rev and the accessory proteins Vpr, Vpu, and Vif are essential for viral replication, and their cytoplasmic production suggests that they should be processed for recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. However, only limited data is available evaluating to which extent these proteins are targeted in natural infection and optimal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes within these proteins have not been defined. In this study, CTL responses against HIV-1 Tat, Rev, Vpr, Vpu, and Vif were analyzed in 70 HIV-1 infected individuals and 10 HIV-1 negative controls using overlapping peptides spanning the entire proteins. Peptide-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production was measured by Elispot assay and flow-based intracellular cytokine quantification. HLA class I restriction and cytotoxic activity were confirmed after isolation of peptide-specific CD8+ T-cell lines. All regulatory and accessory proteins served as targets for HIV-1- specific CTL and multiple CTL epitopes were identified in functionally important regions of these proteins. In certain individuals HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses to these accessory and regulatory proteins contributed up to a third to the magnitude of the total HIV-1-specific CTL response. These data indicate that despite the small size of these proteins regulatory and accessory proteins are targeted by CTL in natural HIV-1 infection, and contribute importantly to the total HIV-1-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. These findings are relevant for the evaluation of the specificity and breadth of immune responses during acute and chronic#10; infection, and will be useful for the design and testing of candidate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines."
3524,0.001,1.0000,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."

In order to assess this chemokine in central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection, we measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of CXCL10 by immunoassay in samples derived from 97 HIV-infected subjects across a spectrum of immunological progression and CNS complications and from 16 HIV seronegative control subjects studied at three clinical centers between 1994 and 2001. We also examined changes in the CSF and plasma CXCL10 concentrations in 30 subjects starting and three stopping antiretroviral therapy. CSF CXCL10 concentrations: (1) correlated with CSF HIV RNA and white blood cell (WBC) counts, but not with blood CXCL10, HIV RNA, or CD4 counts; (2) were increased in subjects with primary and asymptomatic HIV infections and AIDS dementia complex, but less frequently in those with more advanced infection, with or without CNS opportunistic diseases except cytomegalovirus encephalitis; (3) decreased in subjects starting antiretroviral in association with decreases in CSF and plasma HIV RNA and CSF WBCs; and (4) conversely, increased in subjects stopping treatment in parallel with CSF HIV RNA and WBCs. These results confirm that CSF CXCL10 associates closely with both CSF HIV and WBCs and suggest that this chemokine may be both a response to and contributing determinant of local infection. High CSF levels may be useful in the diagnosis of ADC in subjects with advanced immunosuppression in whom CMV encephalitis has been ruled out, though this issue requires further study."
9224,0.001,1.0000,"The impact of hepatitis C virus infection (HCI), the most common bloodborne virus infection in the USA, on outcome of active tuberculosis (TB) treatment is largely unknown. We aimed to describe characteristics of TB patients with hepatitis C virus infection (TB-HCI) in King County, Washington, including TB treatment duration and outcome. We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."
6238,0.001,1.0000,"Viral entry inhibitors represent an emerging mode of therapy for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. PRO 542 (CD4-immunoglobulin G2) is a tetravalent CD4-immunoglobulin fusion protein that broadly neutralizes primary HIV-1 isolates. PRO 542 binds to the viral surface glycoprotein gp120 and blocks attachment and entry of virus into CD4(+) cells. Previously, PRO 542 demonstrated antiviral activity without significant toxicity when tested at single doses ranging to 10 mg/kg. In this study, 12 HIV-infected individuals were treated with 25-mg/kg single-dose PRO 542 and then monitored for safety, antiviral effects, and PRO 542 pharmacokinetics for 6 weeks. The study examined two treatment cohorts that differed in the extent of HIV-1 disease progression. PRO 542 at 25 mg/kg was well tolerated and demonstrated a serum half-life of 3 days. Statistically significant acute reductions in HIV-1 RNA levels were observed across all study patients, and greater antiviral effects were observed in the cohort of patients with more advanced HIV-1 disease. In advanced disease (HIV-1 RNA > 100,000 copies/ml; CD4 lymphocytes < 200 cells/mm(3)), PRO 542 mediated an 80% response rate and statistically significant approximately 0.5 log(10) mean reductions in viral load for 4 to 6 weeks posttreatment. Similar findings were obtained in an analysis of all (n = 11) advanced disease patients treated to date with single doses of PRO 542 ranging from 1 to 25 mg/kg. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between antiviral effects observed in vivo and viral susceptibility to PRO 542 in vitro. The findings support continued development of PRO 542 for salvage therapy of advanced HIV-1 disease."

One case, at an early stage of HIV infection, mimicked a severe attack of Crohn's disease, with a negative search for infectious agents. Subtotal colectomy was successfully performed with an uneventful postoperative course. The five other cases concerned patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome at a late stage of immunodeficiency. They were related to Clostridium difficile or cytomegalovirus (CMV) intestinal infection in two and three patients, respectively. One case of CMV colitis presented macroscopically and histologically as pseudomembranous colitis. Emergency subtotal colectomy, performed in the first four patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was followed by a fatal postoperative outcome. The last patient treated conservatively by colonoscopic decompression, in association with anti-CMV therapy, had a favorable short-term outcome. From the experience of our series and data from the literature, we discuss the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach to toxic megacolon in patients with HIV."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has enabled the treatment of medical conditions in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the same way as in the general population. Moreover, improvements in supportive care have allowed HIV-infected patients with life-threatening hematological disorders to be treated with Allo-HSCT. We report on four HIV-infected patients with hematological malignancies receiving an Allo-HSCT in our institution, and on the use of donor lymphocyte infusions to successfully treat post-Allo-HSCT relapse. Of note, one of them is the first HIV(+) patient to receive a ""dual transplant"" (unrelated umbilical cord blood stem cells combined with mobilized T cell-depleted CD34(+) stem cells from a mismatched third party donor). cART drugs interactions were satisfactorily managed. This approach provided long-term control of the hematological disease. Nevertheless, despite adequate immune reconstitution, infections were the main cause of morbidity and mortality after Allo-HSCT."

Patients were stratified according to the severity score of the disease and the outcome (eradication, relapse, failure). We found that both benzyl benzoate and ivermectin alone were quite effective in mild to moderate scabies, but they were both associated with an unacceptable rate of relapse and failure in severe or crusted scabies. In contrast, combined treatment produced an optimal rate of success, without significant treatment-related side-effects. Therefore, we consider that combination treatment with benzyl benzoate solution and oral ivermectin is preferable to single-agent therapy in crusted scabies occurring in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients."

A retrospective study of participants consecutively recruited at the UCSD HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program examined effects of combined ART and SGAs on body mass index (BMI), nonfasting serum lipids, diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Metabolic outcome variables and covariates were compared using t-tests, Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Linear and logistic multivariable models explored metabolic outcomes for participants taking (SGA+) or not taking (SGA-) concomitant SGAs, after controlling for demographic and HIV disease- and ART-related covariates. Of 2229 HIV-infected participants, 12% (N=258) were treated with SGAs. In multivariable models adjusted for relevant covariates, the SGA+ group had significantly higher mean triglycerides, significantly higher odds of DM, significantly higher MAPs and marginally higher BMI. The use of SGAs in HIV-infected adults taking ART was independently associated with worse indicators of MetS and cardiovascular risk. Aggressive monitoring for the metabolic complications from concurrent SGA and ART is indicated in all patients receiving these medication combinations. "

Specifically, the neuropathology associated with AIDS can be diverse, and it ranges from inconsequential cerebrovascular insults to rapidly progressive neuronosis. Moreover, physical impairments may present any time during the course of the disease and even before knowledge of seropositivity. We present three patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), each with a different form of neuropathology, who were treated by rehabilitative services and who gained reasonable functional benefits within moderate time periods. The growing number of HIV-infected persons with physical debilitation mandates a rational, knowledgeable approach to rehabilitation intervention.

The answers given by patients with curable cancer were compared to those given by cancer patients whose treatment intent was palliative and to the replies of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a nonmalignant but also incurable state. The subject population comprised a total of 139 patients. Patients had to complete a questionnaire with a total of 34 items. The answers to the questions were rated on a 5-point scale with response options ranging from 1 to 5 or consisting of true-false statements. Cancer patients, palliative and curative, and HIV-positive patients considered their physicians to be honest (x = 4.34, x = 4.58, and x = 4.30, respectively; p = 0.104), and they emphasized that he/she took enough time answering their questions (x = 4.00, x = 4.30 and x = 4391, respectively; p = 0.12). Cancer patients treated with potentially curable disease were more frequently afraid of being informed about additional diagnostic examinations and about the disclosure of results as compared to cancer patients on palliative care (p < 0.05 for both questions). Patients with HIV-infection considered themselves less informed about the treatment they received as compared to curative cancer patients (x = 3.73 and x = 4.28, respectively; p < 0.046). Only 8.0% of the tumor patients on palliative care, but 63.6% of the HIV-positive patients realized that their medication was given with the objective to relieve symptoms (p < 0.001). When asked about additional goals of treatment, 48% of the palliative cancer patients and 15.1% of the HIV-positive patients checked ""cure"" (p < 0.002). In conclusion, particularly patients with curable cancer were afraid of information they might receive during the medical interview. Cancer patients considered themselves better informed compared to patients with HIV-infection. This is in significant contrast with the actual, measurable knowledge about their disease in the latter group. It is indeed surprising that only a small minority of incurable cancer patients realized that the goal of the medical care they received was relief of symptoms, the principle objective of palliation."

Oncology patients receiving packed red blood cell suspensions and other blood products usually are in the high-risk group for infections due to these viruses. The aim of the study was to detect the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C among chemotherapy patients at the Oncology Department of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBc total and anti-HCV assays were studied by enzyme immunoassay method (Diasorin, Italy) in serum samples of patients (n = 448) referred to the Department of Oncology of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital during 1 June 2006-1 January 2007. Of the 448 patients, 19 (4.2%) were HBsAg-positive, and three (0.7%) had anti-HCV positivity. In this study, the seroprevalence of HBV was similar to previous data in Turkey. This could be due to widespread vaccination programmes. The seroprevalence of low anti-HCV may be because of controlled blood transfusion. Oncology patients should be monitored for their protective antibody levels against HBV, and they must be included in the vaccination programme. Their anti-HCV status should also be checked as well."

From April 2010 to March 2011, a total of 16,875 blood donors were enrolled. Data from HBsAg tests before and after donations were collected to estimate the prevalence of HBsAg. A case-control study was conducted in 265 unique HBsAg-positive blood donors and 530 seronegative donors between January 2011 and October 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) was estimated. The prevalence of HBsAg was 3.17% (95%CI, 2.91-3.43%). The following risk factors were associated with HBV infection: non-vaccination for HBV (OR = 4.236; 95%CI, 2.72-6.60%), razor sharing (OR = 2.370; 95%CI, 1.46-3.84%), dental treatment (OR = 1.714; 95%CI, 1.21-2.43%), acupuncture (OR = 1.983; 95%CI, 1.20-3.28%), a family history of HBV infection (OR = 2.257; 95%CI, 1.32-3.86%), and endoscopy (OR = 2.17; 95%CI, 1.04-4.51%). The PAR values of the risk factors were 42.77%, 31.78%, 13.68%, 6.18%, 6.09%, and 2.85%, respectively, and the total PAR was 68.78%. The prevalence of HBsAg among Chinese blood donors is still high.

In this study we determined the state-wide prevalence rate of dual positivity of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV antibody among hospital patients of Ekiti State, Nigeria, and identified associated factors. Consenting apparently-healthy patients visiting health centers in all local government area (LGA) headquarters of Ekiti State were consecutively selected to a total of 2000 individuals. Patient demographic data pertinent to HBV and HCV transmission were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Subsequently, serum samples prepared from the aseptically collected blood was tested for the presence of both HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody using DiaSpot test strips. The results were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Dual positivity of 7.40% was recorded among the study participants, with 9.80% and 12.80%, respectively, testing positive for HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody. The study patients were, however, most likely to be anti-HCV antibody positive. Nine of the 10 factors studied were independently associated with dual positivity. Five of these, in descending order of odds ratio, were: illiteracy (15.76, p=0.001); having ≥4 sexual partners (9.46, p=0.001); age range of 35-44 y (8.46,p=0.001); farming (7.33, p=0.001); and ""not at all"" to use of condoms during sexual intercourse (4.39, p=0.001). The dual positivity rate was relatively high, with unprotected sexual intercourse as the most probable mode of acquisition of HBV and HCV by the seropositive study participants."
6012,0.001,1.0000,"Antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus, other infectious agents and neopterin levels were determined in 253 patients in a rural area of North-West Tanzania. Seroprevalence for HIV was 3.2%. In one case serology was positive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and questions whether there was a real double infection or a cross reaction not only concerning core region proteins but also transmembrane protein. The specificity in the diagnosis of HIV-infection is markedly increased with newer serological methods using recombinant peptides but did not improve sensitivity on African sera. Neopterin was determined as a sensitive indirect marker for the activation of T-cells and is therefore correlated with the susceptibility of HIV infection and with progression of disease. High seroprevalence rates for various infectious agents were determined and may explain the high rate of elevated neopterin levels in 80% of the Africans. Neopterin levels were even higher in HIV patients. Viral p24 antigen was found only in two persons, one of whom had no antibodies detectable."
1328,0.001,1.0000,"Depression and anxiety are common among persons recently diagnosed with HIV infection. We examined whether depression or anxiety was associated with delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among a prospective cohort of Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) who were newly diagnosed with HIV. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for measuring depression and anxiety, with scores of 0-7, 8-10, and 11-21 representing normal, borderline, and likely, respectively. ART initiation information was extracted from the National ART Database. Cox regression was performed to assess associations between HADS scores and the time to ART initiation. Of 364 eligible participants enrolling in the cohort within a median of 11 days after HIV diagnosis, 62% initiated ART during the 12-month follow-up period. The baseline prevalence for likely/borderline depression was 36%, and likely/borderline anxiety was 42%. In adjusted analyses, compared with a depression score of 0, the likelihood of starting ART was 1.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.41], 3.11 (95% CI: 1.82-5.30), and 2.53 (95% CI: 1.48-4.32) times higher for depression scores of 3, 9, and 13, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for the anxiety score. In contrast to our hypothesis, both depression and anxiety were associated with earlier ART initiation among Chinese MSM with newly diagnosed HIV. We speculate that individuals who are more concerned about their new HIV diagnosis may be more likely to seek HIV care and follow a doctor's advice. The effects of depression or anxiety on ART initiation likely differ in varying subgroups and by symptom severity."
9785,0.001,1.0000,Five hundred and ten inner city adolescent girls requesting reproductive health services were surveyed about their knowledge and beliefs concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Each patient's survey responses were examined in relation to number of sexual partners and history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Adolescents with the greatest concerns and fears of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were those with multiple sexual partners. Those with the joint effects of multiple sexual partners and a history of STD were the most likely to acknowledge their potential for HIV infection and have a behavioral basis for it. Sexual behaviors within this age group are highlighted and programmatic interventions are suggested.
7630,0.001,1.0000,"In a prospective study of pregnant women infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in Brooklyn, New York, USA, 16 (29%) of 55 evaluable infants were infected with HIV-1. 9 infants had paediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 6 had less severe clinical manifestations of HIV-1 infection, and 1 was symptom-free but was seropositive for HIV-1 beyond 15 months of age. The 10 infants born at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier were at higher risk of HIV-1 infection than infants born at 38 weeks of gestation or later (60% vs 22%) but the median age at appearance of disease was approximately 5 months in both groups. The HIV-1 transmission rate was not associated with predelivery levels of maternal T cells, anti-p24, or neutralising antibodies but it was higher, among full-term infants, for those with mothers in the lowest third of the distribution of anti-gp120 levels (53%). On immunoblot, transmitting mothers lacked a gp120 band but not other bands. Protection was not associated with antibody to recombinant peptides from the hypervariable region of the major neutralising gp120 epitope, and the anti-gp120 endpoint dilution titre was similar in transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. Mothers of uninfected full-term infants appear to confer immunological protection against HIV-1 infection of their offspring by way of a high-affinity antibody to a gp120 epitope, whose specificity has importance for vaccine development and possibly perinatal immunotherapy."
7553,0.001,1.0000,"Dried blood spots (DBSs) on filter paper are being used increasingly in population-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) studies. This study evaluated the application of a BED enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on DBSs to estimate HIV incidence in a population-based study in India. The Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA was performed on 224 HIV-1-positive DBS samples, after screening 12 617 individuals from a population-based sample in Guntur district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The number of recently infected HIV cases was identified using this BED assay and was used to estimate the annual HIV incidence rate based on calculations and adjustment formulae suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The updated BED data management software provided by the CDC was used for analyses. Of the 224 HIV-1 antibody-positive DBS samples, 29 (12.95 %) were estimated by the BED HIV-1 assay to have been infected within the past 155 days. After adjusting for age, gender and rural/urban distribution of the population, the annual incidence rate of HIV-1 infection was estimated to be 0.32 % (95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.44 %). This annual incidence was 18.6 % of the HIV prevalence of 1.72 % in this study. Thus, the BED assay revealed a higher incidence of HIV in this study than was expected from the prevalence. Correlation of the BED assay with panel testing and longitudinal incidence data in the Indian population is needed to calibrate it for use in India."
8887,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is established by virus variants that use the CCR5 co-receptor for entry (CCR5-tropic or R5 variants), whereas viruses that use CXCR4 as co-receptor (CXCR4-tropic or X4 variants) emerge during disease progression in approximately 50 % of infected subjects. X4 variants may have a higher fitness ex vivo and their detection is usually accompanied by faster T-cell depletion and the onset of AIDS in HIV-1-positive individuals. Here, the relationship between the sequence variation of the HIV-1 env V3-V5 region and positive selective pressure on R5 and X4 variants from infected subjects with CD4 T cell counts below 200 cells microl(-1) was studied. A correlation was found between genetic distance and CD4(+) cell count at late stages of the disease. R5 variants that co-existed with X4 variants were significantly less heterogeneous than R5 variants from subjects without X4 variants (P < 0.0001). Similarly, X4 variants had a significantly higher diversity than R5 variants (P < 0.0001), although residues under positive selection had a similar distribution pattern in both variants. Therefore, both X4 and R5 variants were subjected to high selective pressures from the host. Furthermore, the interaction between X4 and R5 variants within the same subject resulted in a purifying selection on R5 variants, which only survived as a homogeneous virus population. These results indicate that R5 variants from X4 phenotype samples were highly homogeneous and under weakly positive selective pressures. In contrast, R5 variants from R5 phenotype samples were highly heterogeneous and subject to positive selective pressures."
7845,0.001,1.0000,"HLA-B*5701 is the host factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression, although rates can vary within this group. Underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but likely involve both immunological and virological dynamics. The present study investigated HIV-1 in vivo evolution and epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in six HLA-B*5701 patients who had not received antiretroviral treatment, monitored from early infection for up to 7 years. The subjects were classified as high-risk progressors (HRPs) or low-risk progressors (LRPs) based on baseline CD4(+) T cell counts. Dynamics of HIV-1 Gag p24 evolution and multifunctional CD8(+) T cell responses were evaluated by high-resolution phylogenetic analysis and polychromatic flow cytometry, respectively. In all subjects, substitutions occurred more frequently in flanking regions than in HLA-B*5701-restricted epitopes. In LRPs, p24 sequence diversity was significantly lower; sequences exhibited a higher degree of homoplasy and more constrained mutational patterns than HRPs. The HIV-1 intrahost evolutionary rate was also lower in LRPs and followed a strict molecular clock, suggesting neutral genetic drift rather than positive selection. Additionally, polyfunctional CD8(+) T cell responses, particularly to TW10 and QW9 epitopes, were more robust in LRPs, who also showed significantly higher interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in early infection. Overall, the findings indicate that HLA-B*5701 patients with higher CD4 counts at baseline have a lower risk of HIV-1 disease progression because of the interplay between specific HLA-linked immune responses and the rate and mode of viral evolution. The study highlights the power of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating high-resolution evolutionary and immunological data, to understand mechanisms underlying HIV-1 pathogenesis."
9278,0.001,1.0000,"Surgeons throughout the country are frequently asked to consult on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients experiencing abdominal pain. Disease processes vary remarkably within this population and often occur with confusing presentations and unusual pathologies related to the immunocompromised state. With the increased awareness and treatment of HIV infection, it can be anticipated that many patients will require surgery for secondary complications of AIDS, in addition to surgical problems unrelated to HIV infection. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with HIV infection underwent major abdominal surgery between 1986 and 1990 at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. Those patients classified as having AIDS had a longer post procedure hospitalization (19 days vs 9 days; P < 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (33% vs 10%). All of the patients who underwent appendectomy survived with few complications. Excluding appendectomy patients, operative mortality was predicted by low serum albumin (P < 0.001). In addition, preoperative hematocrits were considerably lower in non-survivors. Total serum protein and total WBC counts were not predictors of operative outcome."
1327,0.001,1.0000,"In developed countries, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become a chronic disease. The aims of this study were to clarify the physical, social, and psychological factors affecting Japanese HIV patients in a stable condition and to identify factors related to mental health of employed and unemployed HIV patients. The target subjects were people with HIV infection who were treated as outpatients at core hospitals for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment in Japan. A questionnaire including items from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was sent to each medical facility with a request for participation from the HIV-infected outpatients. Responses from 1199 patients were analyzed. Mental health was reportedly better in the employed patients than in the unemployed patients. The unemployed patients were more likely to have resigned from their jobs because of poor health, to have resigned voluntarily, or to have been unfairly dismissed. Once the patients stopped working because of HIV, returning to work became difficult. In the employed patients, a good workplace environment was strongly related to lower scores on HADS. Higher HADS scores were recorded for employed patients infected with HIV for six years or more. For the unemployed patients, a relationship was observed between strong feelings of stigmatization and HADS scores. Quitting a job because of an experience related to HIV status may be related to feelings of stigmatization. "
6065,0.001,1.0000,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."
8310,0.001,1.0000,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
2046,0.001,1.0000,"CD8+ lymphocyte phenotypes were characterized during acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and a comparison was made to previous studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This was of interest because CD8+ cells contribute to immunologic control of both infections, but the usual outcome of EBV infection is benign, whereas untreated HIV infection is fatal. During acute EBV infection, CD8+ cells expressed elevated levels of the activation antigens CD38 and HLA-DR, similar to that during chronic HIV infection. Within 16 weeks, when EBV latency is established, CD8+ cell activation had resolved. In contrast, activation persists in HIV infection. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ cells could be a marker for ongoing viral replication in both infections. Other CD8+ cell alterations observed in this study of acute EBV infection included increases in both CD62L- and CD62L+ CD8+ cells and unique kinetics in the expansion of the CD57+CD8+ cell subset."
7972,0.001,1.0000,The Bel-1 protein of human foamy virus can activate transcription directed by the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The target sequence for Bel-1 is shown to lie within the HIV-1 LTR U3 region but does not coincide with any previously described factor-binding site. Gene expression directed by an HIV-1 LTR lacking functional sites for the inducible cellular transcription factor NF-kappa B was activated over 100-fold by coexpression of Bel-1. These observations suggest that Bel-1 has the potential to significantly enhance the level of HIV-1 gene expression in cells dually infected with HIV-1 and human foamy virus.

5246,0.001,1.0000,"The absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood is prognostic for disease progression, yet the cell surface density of CD4 receptors or chemokine receptors on a single cell has not previously been found to be predictive of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity outcome. It has recently been shown that human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and its ligand alpha(1) proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)PI; alpha(1)antitrypsin) act as HIV fusion cofactors. The present study shows that decreased HIV infectivity is significantly correlated with decreased cell surface density of HLE but not with decreased CD4 nor chemokine receptors. In vitro HIV infectivity outcome in this study was predicted by the surface density of HLE on mononuclear phagocytes but not on lymphocytes. The set point HLE surface density was in part determined by alpha(1)PI. Decreased circulating alpha(1)PI was correlated with increased cell surface HLE and with increased HIV infectivity. The correlation of HIV infectivity outcome with surface HLE and circulating alpha(1)PI supports the utility of these HIV cofactors in diagnostic analysis and therapeutic intervention."
2222,0.001,1.0000,"The question is addressed whether particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) polymorphisms are associated with clinical course and outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

None of the polymorphisms was significantly associated with long-term asymptomatic survival after HIV-1 infection compared with progression to clinical AIDS. Moreover, specific AIDS-defining illnesses or biologic phenotype of the HIV-1 virus were not associated with TNF-alpha alleles. The results of this study do not point toward a role for known TNF-alpha G to A transition polymorphisms in the clinical course of HIV-1 infection."
8599,0.001,1.0000,"The development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) involves the adaptation of viral sequences coding for the V3 loop of the env protein. The plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may contain viral populations from various cellular sources and with differing pathogenicity. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may alter the relative abundance of these viral populations, leading to a genetic shift. We characterized plasma and CNS viral populations prior to and during cART and relate the findings to viral elimination kinetics and the clinical phenotype. Longitudinal plasma and CSF samples of five chronically infected HIV patients, four of whom had HAND, and one seroconverter were analyzed for V3 sequences by RT-PCR and sequence analysis. In the chronically infected patients, pre-cART plasma and CSF viral sequences were different irrespective of viral elimination kinetics and clinical phenotype. cART induced replacement of plasma viral populations in all subjects. CSF viral populations underwent a clear genetic shift in some patients but remained stable in others. This was not dependent on the presence of HAND. The genetic shift of CSF V3 sequences was absent in the two subjects whose CSF viral load initially increased during cART. In one patient, pre- and post-treatment CSF sequences were closely related to the post-treatment plasma sequences, suggesting a common cellular source. We found heterogeneous patterns of genetic compartmentalization and genetic shift over time. Although these did not closely match viral elimination kinetics and clinical phenotype, the results imply different patterns of the dynamics and relative contribution of compartment-specific virus populations in chronic HIV infection."

9939,0.001,1.0000,"In the United States and Western Europe, most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections are caused by subtype B. We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 RNA in plasma samples from 141 children enrolled into PACTG 377, a comparative study of several antiretroviral therapy regimens. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two children, both born in the United States, were infected with non-B subtypes that are most commonly found in Africa: one with subtype D and the other with circulating recombinant form CRF02, an A/G recombinant lineage. Viral load assays performed to monitor treatment response underestimated the levels of HIV-1 RNA in the child with the A/G recombinant. These cases demonstrate mother-to-child transmission of non-B subtypes of HIV-1 in the United States. Non-B subtypes should be considered in the management of HIV-1-infected pregnant women and children to optimize strategies to prevent and treat pediatric HIV-1 infection."
8221,0.001,1.0000,"The RNA genome of the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is significantly richer in adenine nucleotides than the statistically equal distribution of the four different nucleotides that is expected. This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."
1387,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lymphocyte P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and genotype in vivo and the expression of lymphocyte receptors critical in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), i.e., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Using flow cytometry to quantify each membrane receptor/transporter, we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between P-gp protein expression and the expression of CXCR4 (rho = 0.874; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed colocalized expression of CXCR4 and P-gp in the lymphocyte membrane. This significant relationship was also apparent at the mRNA level by use of reverse transcription-PCR (rho = 0.61; P < 0.005) and was present in both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotypic analysis of the C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphism of P-gp confirmed significantly higher levels of P-gp in C (range, 2.45 to 11.00 relative fluorescence units [RFU])- than in T (range, 0.25 to 5.00 RFU)-homozygous individuals (P = 0.0088; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7 to 6.3 RFU). An equivalent association between CXCR4 levels and C (range, 12.7 to 44.1 RFU) versus T (range, 3 to 18.9 RFU) genotype was also demonstrated (P = 0.0019; 95% CI, 5.4 to 23.7). Functionally, although these correlates had no impact on HIV-1 production from either X4- or R5-tropic virus, expression correlated significantly with the activity of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir for both P-gp (rho = 0.75; P = 0.0019) and CXCR4 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.0041). This study defines an association between P-gp (expression and genotype) and CXCR4 that may have implications for the selection of viral tropism and the access of drugs to protease for specific tropic types. The interplay between these two proteins may also influence the viral genotypes which escape effective chemotherapy and which therefore have the opportunity to evolve resistance to PIs."
2353,0.001,1.0000,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."
4653,0.001,1.0000,"The emergence of drug-resistant variants has posed a significant setback against effective antiviral treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The choice of a nonmutable region of the viral genome such as the conserved transactivation response element (TAR element) in the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) may potentially be an effective target for drug development. We have earlier demonstrated that a polyamide nucleotide analog (PNA) targeted to the TAR hairpin element, when transfected into cells, can effectively inhibit Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) LTR (T. Mayhood et al., Biochemistry 39:11532-11539, 2000). Here we show that this anti-TAR PNA (PNA(TAR)), upon conjugation with a membrane-permeating peptide vector (transportan) retained its affinity for TAR in vitro similar to the unconjugated analog. The conjugate was efficiently internalized into the cells when added to the culture medium. Examination of the functional efficacy of the PNA(TAR)-transportan conjugate in cell culture using luciferase reporter gene constructs resulted in a significant inhibition of Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. Furthermore, PNA(TAR)-transportan conjugate substantially inhibited HIV-1 production in chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells. The mechanism of this inhibition appeared to be regulated at the level of transcription. These results demonstrate the efficacy of PNA(TAR)-transportan as a potential anti-HIV agent."
6100,0.001,1.0000,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

We describe the application of a simple technique using commercially available kits for detection of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) in dried blood spots (DBS) collected on filter paper. Study participants included subjects with and without chronic HBV infection and subjects with HCC or cirrhosis. Three to five blood drops were dried on filter paper. Dried blood (equivalent to 20 muL) was eluted and tested for HBsAg by Determine(TM) HBsAg and for AFP by counter-current immuno-electrophoresis and radio-immunoassay (RIA). The primary analysis focused on comparison of DBS results to serum testing results as the gold standard. The sensitivity of DBS for detecting chronic HBV infection was 96% (98-98) with specificity of 100% (CI 99-100). Sensitivity of DBS in detecting AFP compared with serum RIA was 73% (60-86) with specificity of 90% (81-98). Both HBsAg and AFP recovery were unaffected when DBS were left at room temperature (30-33 degrees C) and under humid conditions for up to 28 days prior to elution. We conclude that DBS can be reliably used as an economical and logical alternative for detection of HBsAg in chronically infected patients and for AFP-based diagnosis of HCC in clinical situations which preclude adequate collection and processing of blood samples. Both research-oriented field studies and routine clinical care may benefit from application of these techniques in resource-limited settings."
7769,0.001,1.0000,"In this report we evaluate the human immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) following remote infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBsAg-reactive lymphocytes can be readily demonstrated in the peripheral blood of individuals with established immunity following infection with HBV. In vitro stimulation with small doses of plasma-derived HBsAg, yeast-derived HBsAg (S region) or pre-S2 peptide will induce specific IgG to HBsAg (anti-HBs) in the absence of a polyclonal increase in total IgG. The pre-S2 peptide will stimulate, in a T cell-dependent fashion, the in vitro production of anti-HBs with specificity for the S domain. This anti-HBs production is mediated by pre-S2-stimulated soluble T-cell factors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with established immunity proliferate to the yeast-derived HBsAg but not to the plasma-derived HBsAg or pre-S2 peptide. The chronic HBsAg carriers do not produce anti-HBs following stimulation with HBsAg regardless of the source or component of antigen used. Different study protocols failed to demonstrate HBsAg-specific responses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic carriers."
4638,0.001,1.0000,"The epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important for health planners and service providers. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for markers of HBV (HBsAg) and anti-HCV among hemodialysis patients at the Ahmed Gasim hemodialysis unit, Sudan. Structured questionnaires were used to obtain socio-demographic data and sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). Of the 353 patients enrolled in the study, HBsAg and anti-HCV were detected in 16 (4.5%) and 30 (8.5%) patients, respectively. None of the patients were co-infected with HBV and HCV. Multivariate analysis showed that duration of dialysis was significantly associated with anti-HCV seropositivity [OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.2-1.3; P = 0.024]. No other socio-demographic or clinical characteristics (age, sex, level of education, history of surgery, and number of units of blood transfused) were significantly associated with HBsAg or anti-HCV seropositivity. The results of this study suggest that HBsAg and anti-HCV have low prevalence among hemodialysis patients in Khartoum. Longer duration of dialysis was a risk factor for anti-HCV."
142,0.001,1.0000,"HAART may increase CD4+ T cell counts despite a persistently detectable HIV load. The impact of HAART on apoptosis, which may play a role in the disease process in HIV-infected patients, has not been extensively studied. We performed a study to compare the level of spontaneous T cell apoptosis and anti-retroviral treatments in a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients. Data were obtained from a computerized medical record. Quantification of apoptotic cells was by cytofluorometric technique. From November 1995 to December 1997 we studied T cell apoptosis in 112 HIV-infected patients. Forty patients were classified A, 36 B and 36 C. Thirty patients were naive and 82 received an anti-retroviral treatment, 49 including a protease inhibitor (PI). The median plasma viraemia determined in 63 patients was 3.6 (range 1.3-5.6) log10. The median apoptotic cell count was 22% (range 2-73%) and 12% (range 2-60%) for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. We did not observe any correlation between the HIV viraemia and the level of apoptosis of T cell subsets. Patients with HAART showed a lower percentage of apoptotic CD4+ T cells only: 16% (range 2-61%) versus 25% (range 5-73%) for patients receiving two nucleoside analogues (P = 0.02). This effect was significant in stage A patients and remained observable during the whole course of HIV disease. In conclusion, HAART, without any relation to plasma viraemia, is able to reduce apoptosis of CD4+ T cells."
9264,0.001,1.0000,"Although infrequent, kidney disease is a potentially serious co-morbidity among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The spectrum of renal impairment is very wide from clinically insignificant to end stage renal disease and often requires nephrologist's consultation. Therefore, we established combined renal and HIV care in the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Medical records of patients consulted by nephrologist from March 2014 to March 2015 were included in analyses. Patients changing medication without consulting the physician or persistently not coming for follow-up visits were defined as non-compliant. In statistical analyses, non-parametric tests and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. In total, 100 patients were consulted by a nephrologist during the study period. All patients were white Europeans, 88 (88%) male, 42 (42%) infected through men having sex with men and 16 (16%) through intravenous drug users. Fifteen (15%) patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 11 (11%) confirmed with positive HCV RNA. The most common reasons for referral were proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. In 6 out of 31 patients (19.3% of those referred for increased creatinine level) elevated serum creatinine was due to illegal substances or diet supplements use. Fifty-seven (57%) of patients were non-compliant. In univariate logistic regression models, all tested factors were non-significant. In most cases, patients were referred to nephrologist due to possible link between laboratory abnormalities and antiretroviral treatment. In one out of five cases, elevated creatinine level was linked with substance/dietary abuse. Poor compliance is an important problem in integrated nephrological care, however we were not able to identify any factors associated with non-compliance."
4401,0.001,1.0000,"The efficacy of protease inhibitor drugs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is limited by the selection and expansion of drug-resistant mutations. HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."
1322,0.001,1.0000,"An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7 variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant, c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7 variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7 variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific effect of this X-chromosomal variation."
8076,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection occurs frequently in patients with preexisting mental illness. Treatment for chronic hepatitis C using interferon formulations often increases risk for neuro-psychiatric symptoms. Pegylated-Interferon-α (PegIFN-α) remains crucial for attaining sustained virologic response (SVR); however, PegIFN-α based treatment is associated with psychiatric adverse effects, which require dose reduction and/or interruption. This study's main objective was to identify genes induced by PegIFN-α and expressed in the central nervous system and immune system, which could mediate the development of psychiatric toxicity in association with antiviral outcome. Using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/HCV co-infected donors (N = 28), DNA microarray analysis was performed and 21 differentially regulated genes were identified in patients with psychiatric toxicity versus those without. Using these 21 expression profiles a two-way-ANOVA was performed to select genes based on antiviral outcome and occurrence of neuro-psychiatric adverse events. Microarray analysis demonstrated that Interferon-stimulated-exonuclease-gene 20 kDa (ISG20) and Interferon-alpha-inducible-protein 27 (IFI27) were the most regulated genes (P < 0.05) between three groups that were built by combining antiviral outcome and neuro-psychiatric toxicity. Validation by bDNA assay confirmed that ISG20 expression levels were significantly associated with these outcomes (P < 0.035). Baseline levels and induction of ISG20 correlated independently with no occurrence of psychiatric adverse events and non-response to therapy (P < 0.001). Among the 21 genes that were associated with psychiatric adverse events and 20 Interferon-inducible genes (IFIGs) used as controls, only ISG20 expression was able to link PegIFN-α related neuro-psychiatric toxicity to distinct HCV-responses in patients co-infected with HIV and HCV in vivo."
3982,0.001,1.0000,"Mathematical modeling of the biological effect of interferon on virus decay permits the quantification of the efficacy (epsilon) of blocking virion production in different patient populations. The viral dynamic and immunologic responses of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to daily interferon therapy were characterized in twelve patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Three out of the twelve patients (25%) achieved an early viral response, a two-log reduction in HCV RNA by week 12. The mean epsilon of IFN-alpha in blocking HCV and HIV production were 72% and 74%, respectively. For HCV epsilon was highest (97%) in the one patient who had a sustained viral response, while it was reduced in the other two patients (68% and 77%). Baseline HCV RNA and the number of CD3+CD56+16+ cells were inversely related (r = -0.89, p = 0.03), and baseline HCV-specific immune responses were significantly higher in the three patients with 2-log viral load reductions. These data suggest that: 1) interferon efficacy at blocking virion production is correlated with treatment outcome in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, 2) that immunodeficient patients can respond to standard IFN-alpha, 3) that both innate and adaptive immune responses may be important determinants of HCV RNA decline in response to interferon."
7841,0.001,1.0000,"Vigorous proliferative CD4(+) T cell responses are the hallmark of spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, whereas comparable responses are absent in chronically evolving infection. Here, we comprehensively characterized the breadth, specificity, and quality of the HCV-specific CD4(+) T cell response in 31 patients with acute HCV infection and varying clinical outcomes. We analyzed in vitro T cell expansion in the presence of interleukin-2, and ex vivo staining with HCV peptide-loaded MHC class II tetramers. Surprisingly, broadly directed HCV-specific CD4(+) T cell responses were universally detectable at early stages of infection, regardless of the clinical outcome. However, persistent viremia was associated with early proliferative defects of the HCV-specific CD4(+) T cells, followed by rapid deletion of the HCV-specific response. Only early initiation of antiviral therapy was able to preserve CD4(+) T cell responses in acute, chronically evolving infection. Our results challenge the paradigm that HCV persistence is the result of a failure to prime HCV-specific CD4(+) T cells. Instead, broadly directed HCV-specific CD4(+) T cell responses are usually generated, but rapid exhaustion and deletion of these cells occurs in the majority of patients. The data further suggest a short window of opportunity to prevent the loss of CD4(+) T cell responses through antiviral therapy."
3079,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important health problem worldwide. The virus has been classified according to 8 genotypes (A-H) based on sequence divergence. Most genotypes have specific geographic distributions; genotypes A and D are prevalent in Western Europe and North America, and genotypes B and C are prevalent in East Asia and Oceania. Currently accepted treatment for chronic hepatitis B includes interferon alpha, or the nucleoside/nucleotide analogues lamivudine and adefovir. The impact of HBV genotypes on response to antiviral therapy has been studied. HBV genotypes D and C are associated with a lower rate of favorable response to interferon alpha therapy than genotypes A and B, respectively. A study in Germany suggested that the rate of resistance to lamivudine was higher in patients with HBV genotype A infection than in patients with genotype D infection. No difference in the risk of lamivudine resistance is found between patients with genotype B and patients with genotype C. In patients with genotype C infection, however, virological response is worse during lamivudine therapy, and is also less durable after the discontinuation of therapy than in patients with genotype B infection. Determining the genotype could be helpful for predicting the outcome of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B."
4523,0.001,1.0000,"The combined interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and ribavirin (IFN-alpha/ribavirin) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection results in sustained viral eradication in 31%-64% of the patients. Previous studies have strongly suggested that HCV-specific T-cell responses maybe modulated during this therapy. The objective of this study was to further define the effect of IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy on type 1 and type 2 HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses during IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy. Toward this, serial CD8(+) T-cell responses to HCV-derived epitopes and CD4(+) T-cell responses to the HCV core antigen were analyzed in four patients before (baseline), during (at 24 weeks), and at the end (at 48 weeks) of IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy. Therapy-induced viral clearance in three patients was associated with a significant augmentation of HCV-specific type 1 CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses. In contrast, in a patient who did not respond to therapy, a significant HCV-specific CD4(+) Th2 cell reactivity was observed accompanied by a lack of augmentation of the HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell reactivity. These results indicate that enhancement of HCV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses is an important factor in determining the response to the IFN-alpha/ribavirin therapy and the outcome of the HCV infection."
1831,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a hepatocyte-specific DNA virus whose gene expression and replication are closely associated with hepatic metabolic processes. Thus, a potential anti-viral strategy is to target the host metabolic factors necessary for HBV gene expression and replication. Recent studies revealed that fatty acid translocase CD36 is involved in the replication, assembly, storage, and secretion of certain viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the relationship between CD36 and the HBV life cycle remains unclear. Here, we showed, for the first time, that increased CD36 expression enhances HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. To understand the underlying molecular basis, we performed genome-wide sequencing of the mRNA from HepG2.2.15-CD36 overexpression (CD36OE) cells and HepG2.2.15-vector cells using RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to analyze the differential transcriptomic profile. Our results identified 141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to CD36 overexpression, including 79 upregulated genes and 62 downregulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that some of the DEGs were involved in various metabolic processes and the HBV life cycle. The reliability of the RNA-Seq data was confirmed by qPCR analysis. Our findings provide clues to build a link between CD36, host metabolism and the HBV life cycle and identified areas that require further investigation."
5560,0.001,1.0000,"Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase is a chromatin-bound enzyme which is activated by free DNA ends and is therefore stimulated by a variety of DNA-damaging agents. The enzyme transfers the ADP moiety of NAD to nuclear proteins to create protein-bound ADP-ribose polymers. Under conditions favouring an accelerated poly(ADP-ribose) polymer formation, the enzyme may exhaust cellular NAD pools. At the same time, or shortly thereafter ATP levels drop and cell viability eventually declines. As a series of chemical and physical agents which may play a role in activating latent HIV-1 infection or favouring HIV-1 replication, have a DNA-damaging activity, we investigated the behaviour of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity in various types of HIV-1-infected cells. The results obtained show that HIV-1-infected cells to possess an increased poly(ADP-ribosol)ating activity together with an accentuated fragmentation of cellular DNA which are associated with the time course of HIV-1 replication. These data give circumstantial support to the hypothesis that a NAD-depdendent cellular suicide response to DNA damage, could play a role in the death of HIV-1 infected cells. In this respect, the impared immunocompetence of HIV-1-infected patients could bear some resemblance to immune attribution that sometimes accompanies some inborn errors affecting DNA precursor metabolism and DNA integrity."
31,0.001,1.0000,"HIV replication is suppressed in vitro by a CD8(+) cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development."
2737,0.001,1.0000,"The hallmark of the immunodeficiency virus infection is a progressive detriment of the immune response which has been associated to a gradual loss of its responsible components, in particularly, CD4 positive T cells. Although this cell population is considered the main target of the virus, there is a recent deal of interest in studying other components that may not be targets of the virus, but are important elements to control infectious microorganisms and that have been demonstrated to be altered during HIV infection. Neutrophils (PMN) are innate immune components that play a fundamental role against HIV infection and these cells have been described as functionally altered during AIDS. It has been suggested that such a dysfunction could be attributed to an increased susceptibility of these cells to accelerated spontaneous apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanisms that induce programmed cell death of neutrophils remain unknown. In previous works we have explored some events involved during cell death of neutrophils from HIV infected patients. It is the purpose of this work to review the current knowledge of apoptosis signals in neutrophils and to discuss our own data about some mechanisms involved in spontaneous and Fas mediated apoptosis, which may contribute to understand neutrophils dysfunction during HIV infection."

Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m; <30 kg/m, obesity was ≥30 kg/m. Patients' characteristics contemporary to BMI assessment were collected. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors associated with overweight/obesity.Eight hundred sixty-two patients, median age 51 years, 21.5 years of HIV infection follow-up, 585 (68%) male, 829 (96%) receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for median 16.7 years, 768 (91%) HIV load <40 copies/mL, 618 (73%) CD4 ≥500 cells/mm; 266 (31%) HCV serology, 110 (13%) had detectable HCV-RNA. Overweight affected 191 (22%) patients and obesity 46 (5%). Overweight and obesity were associated with age, HIV follow-up duration, and HIV transmission risk group. Overweight was also associated with gender and HCV status. In patients with substance use data, overweight was associated with alcohol and nonsmoking status. Obesity was associated with nonsmoking and ex-smoker status. Overweight/obesity were not found associated with cART or immune cell counts.In HIV-infected people, aging, alcohol consumption, nonsmoking, and ex-smoker status, the absence of HCV coinfection and to have cleared HCV infection are associated with overweight and/or obesity. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and consider introducing weight management programs as part of routine HIV care."

Apart from its role in assisting protein folding in cooperation with Hsp10, Hsp60 contributes to regulation of apoptosis, as well as participates in modulation of the immune system activity. Hsp60 may favor oncogenesis by promoting survival or growth of some tumor cell types. Hsp60 is a subject of medical research due to its role in pathogenesis of certain tumors and infectious diseases.

We hypothesized that a field test for mastitis used for bovine milk, the California Mastitis Test, would detect high cell counts in milk of HIV-infected women. We also investigated whether total milk cell count would positively correlate with viral HIV-1 RNA in the milk of 128 HIV-positive Zambian women. Mean cell counts in each California Mastitis Test scoring category were significantly different (p < 0.01, n = 232). In a subset of 4-month postpartum milk samples tested for HIV-1 RNA, viral RNA levels did not significantly correlate with total cell count (r = 0.166, p = .244). The CMT may serve as a screening tool for mastitis in breastmilk, but total cell count does not correlate with HIV-1 RNA levels. Since both cell-free and cell-associated virus are associated with increased risk of MTCT, investigation of the relationship between total milk cell count and HIV-1 proviral DNA is warranted before a conclusive determination is made regarding use of the CMT as a clinical screening tool to detect cases at high risk for breastmilk transmission."
2099,0.001,1.0000,"This work aims to elucidate the effects of age and HIV-1 infection on the frequency and function of T cell subsets in response to HIV-specific and non-specific stimuli. As compared with the younger AIDS group, the frequencies of naive and central memory T cells were significantly lower in aged AIDS patients. Although there was also a dramatic loss of classical CD4(+)FoxP3(+)CD25(+)Treg cells in this patient group, high frequencies of IL-10-producing CD4(+)FoxP3(-) T cells were observed. In our system, the increased production of IL-10 in aged AIDS patients was mainly derived from Env-specific CD4(+)FoxP3(-)CD152(+) T cells. Interestingly, while the blockade of IL-10 activity by monoclonal antibody clearly enhanced the release of IL-6 and IL-1β by Env-stimulated PBMC cultures from aged AIDS patients, this monoclonal antibody enhanced in vitro HIV-1-replication. In conclusion, HIV infection and aging undoubtedly contribute synergistically to a complex immune dysfunction in T cell compartment of HAART-treated older HIV-infected individuals."
4121,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a significant impact on HIV-1 RNA levels, the CD4 cell count, and immune activation. We examined whether these changes are associated with a change in the rate of tryptophan degradation (expressed as the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, kyn/trp) as an estimate for the activity of interferon-gamma inducible enzyme indoleamine (, )-dioxygenase (IDO). Plasma levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, and neopterin were measured pretherapy and 6 months postinitiation of therapy in 45 patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 1000 copies/ml 6 months after initiation of ART. Before ART, the patients had decreased tryptophan and increased kynurenine concentrations compared to healthy controls. During ART, average tryptophan levels increased; in the same time kynurenine and kyn/trp decreased (P < 0.001), although not to normal levels. Since pretherapy tryptophan concentrations correlated inversely with neopterin, and kynurenine correlated with viral load and neopterin but not with CD4 cell count, the data support the view that HIV production may induce immune activation and consequently tryptophan is degraded at a higher rate. In agreement, kyn/trp positively correlated with neopterin (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001), with virus load (r(s) = 0.37, P = 0.013), and very weakly with CD4(+) cells counts (r(s) = 0.30, P = 0.049). The change in the kyn/trp ratio during ART correlated more strongly with the change in neopterin levels (r(s) = 0.49, P = 0.001) than with the change in HIV RNA levels and weakly with the CD4 cell count. The data underscore the fact that both neopterin production and tryptophan degradation are triggered by immune activation. Tryptophan degradation is increased in HIV infection and partially reversed under ART. The data agree with the concept that immune activation is the common background of IDO activation which may be an important factor underlying T-cell hyporesponsiveness."
2113,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."

HBcrAg combines the antigenic reactivity resulting from denatured hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV core antigen and an artificial core-related protein (p22cr). In Asian patients, high levels of HBcrAg have been suggested to be an independent risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, while low levels could guide safe cessation of treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. We here studied HBcrAg levels in different phases of HBV infection in a large European cohort predominantly infected with genotypes A and D: HBeAg-positive immune tolerance (n = 30), HBeAg-positive immune clearance (IC) (n = 60), HBeAg-negative hepatitis (ENH) (n = 50), HBeAg-negative inactive/quiescent carrier phase (c) (n = 109) and acute hepatitis B (n = 8). Median HBcrAg levels were high in the immune tolerance and immune clearance phases (8.41 and 8.11 log U/mL, respectively), lower in ENH subjects (4.82 log U/mL) but only 2.00 log U/mL in ENQ subjects. Correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA varied among the different phases of HBV infection, while HBcrAg moderately correlated with hepatitis B surface antigen in all phases. ENQ patients had HBcrAg levels <3 log U/mL in 79%, in contrast to only 12% in the ENH group. HBcrAg levels vary significantly during the different phases of HBV infection. HBcrAg may serve as valuable marker for virus replication and reflect the transcriptional activity of intrahepatic cccDNA. In HBeAg-negative patients, HBcrAg may help to distinguish between inactive carriers (ENQ) and those with active disease (ENH)."

This paper presents a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey and clinical data for 370 male veterans who were residents of a domiciliary care program for homeless veterans in Los Angeles, using chi(2), Fisher's Exact, and logistic regression analysis. About one-third (30.8%) of the sample tested positive for current or past HBV infection (ie, seropositive for either the HBV core antibody or surface antigen). After multivariate analysis, rates of HBV were significantly higher among veterans who were older, non-white, or who had a history of regular heroin use (a proxy measure for injection drug use), drug overdose, or drug detoxification treatment. The rate of current or past HBV infection among veterans in this sample (30.8%) was high compared to an estimated 5% to 8% of the general US population. Also, 3% of the sample were currently infected with HBV. Strategies for intervention include broader screening, immunization, and treatment interventions with this high-risk group."
5243,0.001,1.0000,"In Waorani communities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador, hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen was found in 14% of asymptomatic persons. The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
1140,0.001,1.0000,"To better understand patient beliefs, which may influence adherence to HIV care and treatment, we examined three dimensions of beliefs among Ethiopian adults (n = 1177) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Beliefs about benefits of ART/HIV clinical care were largely accurate, but few patients believed in the ability of ART to prevent sexual transmission and many thought Holy Water could cure HIV. Factors associated with lower odds of accurate beliefs included advanced HIV, lack of formal education, and Muslim religion (benefits of ART/clinical care); secondary or university education and more clinic visits (ART to prevent sexual transmission); and pregnancy and Orthodox Christian religion (Holy Water). Assessment of patient beliefs may help providers identify areas needing reinforcement. In this setting, counselors also need to stress the benefits of ART as prevention and that Holy Water should not be used to the exclusion of HIV care and ART."
1355,0.001,1.0000,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
7231,0.001,1.0000,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."
5925,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects and destroys cells of the immune system leading to an overt immune deficiency known as HIV acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The gut associated lymphoid tissue is one of the major lymphoid tissues targeted by HIV-1, and is considered a reservoir for HIV-1 replication and of major importance in CD4+ T-cell depletion. In addition to immunodeficiency, HIV-1 infection also directly causes gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, also known as HIV enteropathy. This enteropathy can manifest itself as many pathological changes in the GI tract. The objective of this study was to determine the association of gut HIV-1 infection markers with long-term survival in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM) enrolled pre-HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy). We examined survival over 15-years in a cohort of 42 HIV-infected cases: In addition to CD4+ T cell counts and HIV-1 plasma viral load, multiple gut compartment (duodenum and colon) biopsies were taken by endoscopy every 6 months during the initial 3-year period. HIV-1 was cultured from tissues and phenotyped and viral loads in the gut tissues were determined. Moreover, the tissues were subjected to an extensive assessment of enteroendocrine cell distribution and pathology. The collected data was used for survival analyses, which showed that patients with higher gut tissue viral load levels had a significantly worse survival prognosis. Moreover, lower numbers of serotonin (duodenum) and somatostatin (duodenum and colon) immunoreactive cell counts in the gut tissues of patients was associated with significant lower survival prognosis. Our study, suggested that HIV-1 pathogenesis and survival prognosis is associated with altered enteroendocrine cell numbers, which could point to a potential role for enteroendocrine function in HIV infection and pathogenesis.

8026,0.001,1.0000,"Sequential infection with different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a rarely identified phenomenon with important implications for immunopathogenesis and vaccine development. Here, we identify an individual whose good initial control of viremia was lost in association with reduced containment of a superinfecting strain. Subject 2030 presented with acute symptoms of HIV-1 infection with high viremia and an incomplete seroconversion as shown by Western blotting. A low set point of viremia (approximately 1,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) was initially established without drug therapy, but a new higher set point (approximately 40,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) manifested about 5 months after infection. Drug susceptibility testing demonstrated a multidrug-resistant virus initially but a fully sensitive virus after 5 months, and an analysis of pol genotypes showed that these were two phylogenetically distinct strains of virus (strains A and B). Replication capacity assays suggested that the outgrowth of strain B was not due to higher fitness conferred by pol, and env sequences indicated that the two strains had the same R5 coreceptor phenotype. Delineation of CD8+-T-lymphocyte responses against HIV-1 showed a striking pattern of decay of the initial cellular immune responses after superinfection, followed by some adaptation of targeting to new epitopes. An examination of targeted sequences suggested that differences in the recognized epitopes contributed to the poor immune containment of strain B. In conclusion, the rapid overgrowth of a superinfecting strain of HIV-1 of the same subtype raises major concerns for effective vaccine development."
3098,0.001,1.0000,"Worldwide there is only limited information on the epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and its association with other hepatotropic viruses. Endemic regions have been described in some Asian countries, whereas in Europe only sporadic cases have been reported. The prevalence of HEV and a series of other viral hepatitis infections was investigated in a group of 1,025 individuals immigrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union. Serum samples were tested for anti-HEV by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on recombinant proteins, and by peptide EIA and immunoblot. Risk factors and other demographic information were investigated using a questionnaire and a short interview. The overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis E antibodies (anti-HEV) was 2.05%. The following risk factors for HEV infection were identified: age of > 65 years, resident in the south-west part of the former Soviet Union, history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and employment in health care professions. HEV prevalence is not strikingly different from that observed in Western European countries. However, the different rates found for HEV vs. hepatitis A virus (HAV) are intriguing, since similar routes of transmission (fecal-oral) are well documented for both viruses. Exposure to HBV is surprisingly high, and the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive individuals was also higher than those reported from Western European areas."
2776,0.001,1.0000,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
4824,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and immune deficiency virus (HIV) in women who were admitted to Sanliurfa Gynecology and Obstetrics Hospital clinics and to compare the results with the previous seropositivity rates reported from different regions of Turkey. The serum samples were screened for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV markers by a commercial chemiluminescence method (UniCel Dxl 800, Beckman Coulter, USA), during a six months period (January 1st to June 30th, 2006). As a result the seropositivity rates of HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV were found as 5.1% (119/2335), 0.9% (18/2066) and 0.1% (3/2548), respectively. While anti-HCV seropositive results were approved by confirmation tests, three of anti-HIV positive results were not confirmed and accepted as false positivities. HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV seropositivities detected in our study were similar to the rates previously reported in other studies in Turkey. However, HBsAg positivity was found slightly higher than the rates that were reported from western parts of our country. This result may be related to the lower socioeconomical status of Sanliurfa (which is located in Southeast Anatolia), and indicates that HBV should be considered as a serious public health problem in East and Southeast parts of Turkey."
5942,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the degree of immune system activation associated with addiction or hepatotropic viruses infection, we examined 60 HIV-negative heroin addicts for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection markers, hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV), various auto-antibodies, and serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R). In addition, 28 anti-HCV positive patients comprising the disease control group, were also examined. Our results demonstrated a high prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies (61.7% and 90% with 1st and 2nd generation ELISA, respectively). Eighty-seven percent (87%) of the addicts positive for anti-HCV by the latter and 92.8% of the disease control patients, were also positive with 2nd generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-II). In 88.9% of anti-HCV positive addicts, antibody to C22-3 was the predominant (anti-C33c in 81.5%). Antibodies to C33c and C22-3 polypeptides were also more frequent in disease control group (92.8% and 85.7%, respectively). Anti-HCV antibodies were associated with increased transaminases (ALT or AST, P < 0.05), as well as with longer duration of addiction (P < 0.005). HBV infection markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc only and anti-HBs) were also present in the addicts (5%, 28.3% and 26.7%, respectively). Rheumatoid factors (RF) were detected in 36.7%, antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in 11.7%, antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) against cardiolipin (anti-CL) and double stranded DNA (anti-ds DNA) in 20% and 50%, respectively. RF, ANA, anti-CL and anti-dsDNA antibodies were also detected in the disease control group (32.1%, 89.3%, 28.5% and 28.5% respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
671,0.001,1.0000,"To evaluate whether frank or subtle disorders of adrenal steroidogenesis exist in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, the adrenal steroid response to an iv bolus of ACTH-(1-24) (0.25 mg Cortrosyn) was determined. Ten children (six males and four females, aged 7 months to 7.5 yr) were studied. Five underwent repeat testing 3-5 months after initial assessment. Nine patients were classified as P2 or symptomatic according to the Center for Disease Control criteria for HIV infection in children. Eight had failure to thrive, six had opportunistic infections and neurological deficits, and two were receiving ketoconazole at the time of ACTH testing. Only one patient had a neonatally acquired transfusion-related HIV infection. Three of the children died 2-5 months after ACTH testing. All patients had normal or slightly elevated baseline and stimulated cortisol levels compared to the control population. The mean post-ACTH cortisol level was significantly higher than the mean post-ACTH level in the control population. No patient demonstrated an impaired aldosterone response to ACTH. The basal and ACTH-stimulated dehydroepiandrosterone levels were normal. Although individual deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels were variable, the mean stimulated deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone levels in the patients were suggestive of a selective defect of the 17-desoxy pathway in the adrenal fasciculata. No changes were noted in the patients' cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and aldosterone responses on repeat ACTH testing. In HIV-infected children we have demonstrated that cortisol and aldosterone synthesis is intact. Thus, the chronic debilitation observed cannot be explained on the basis of adrenal insufficiency. However, a selective deficiency of 17-desoxysteroid hormone production from the adrenal fasciculata may be present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7308,0.001,1.0000,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."
3776,0.001,1.0000,"Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are the main genes that control cell death in the immune system. Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."
7299,0.001,1.0000,"Progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome is a recently recognized variant of necrotizing herpetic retinopathy, developing in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other conditions causing immune compromise. We report a case in which the diagnosis of retinal necrosis syndrome was made before the diagnosis of AIDS was confirmed. A 41-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed extensive retinal necrosis with total retinal detachment in his left eye and multifocal deep retinal lesions scattered in the posterior fundus as well as in the peripheral retina in his right eye. The serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was positive. Despite intravenous acyclovir treatment for 1 week, the lesions in the right eye showed rapid progression. High doses of intravitreal ganciclovir were then given in addition to intravenous acyclovir. After combined treatment for 1 month, the lesions became quiescent and the visual acuity improved to 20/30. Although the patient soon developed full-blown AIDS, the vision in his right eye remained undisturbed. Physicians should suspect progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome in any patient with rapidly progressive necrotizing retinopathy and test the patient for HIV infection. Aggressive combined antiviral agent therapy should be considered to save vision."
2794,0.001,1.0000,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."

We report a treatment-naïve male with chronic HIV-1 infection who presented with an axonal variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Antiretroviral therapy commenced one month later and no rapid improvement or deterioration of tetraparesis was noted. This is the first report that describes the detection and serial measurements of anti-ganglioside antibody in a patient with HIV infection. This case suggests a limited role for T-cell immunity in the production of anti-ganglioside antibody and the pathogenesis of axonal variants, since the antiretroviral therapy-induced improvement in T-cell immunity neither re-elevated anti-ganglioside antibody titer nor worsened tetraparesis."
5317,0.001,1.0000,"The natural course of human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection varies considerably. The identification of laboratory disease markers has become critically important to patient management. This study, carried out on 37 patients with primary HIV-1 infection (PHI), shows that, along with plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T cell counts, evaluation of plasma levels of some immune activation markers (sCD30, TNF-alpha, and sTNFR-I) may help to identify patients at risk of a more rapid disease progression, suggesting that immune activation is among the factors who determine the rate of disease progression. Early combination antiviral therapy significantly decreased levels of virus load and of immune activation markers, suggesting that it may reduce the extent of immune activation through the suppression of HIV-1 replication. Among others, sCD30 could be a more sensitive marker of immune activation, and it might be also useful in the monitoring of the response to antiviral therapy."

In 1 patient, recently started on highly active antiretroviral therapy, MS-like disease could represent an immune reconstitution syndrome. The lesions were reversible in 2 patients, but rapidly fatal in the third patient. These cases show that an MS-like disease may present in advanced HIV infection as focal monophasic leukoencephalopathy with either a reversible or fulminating course, mimicking progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
1208,0.001,1.0000,"The high levels of genetic diversity shown by hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly attributed to the low fidelity of its polymerase. However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV in vivo is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "
5737,0.001,1.0000,"Progression of liver fibrosis in patients with hemoglobinopathies is strongly related to the severity of iron overload and the presence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Effective iron chelation therapy and HCV infection eradication may prevent liver complications. The European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, data regarding the use of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) in this patient population are few. This observational study evaluated the safety and efficacy of therapy with DAAs in an Italian cohort of patients with hemoglobinopathies, chronic HCV infection and advanced liver fibrosis. Between March 2015 and December 2016, 139 patients received DAAs and completed 12 weeks of follow up after the end of treatment for the evaluation of sustained virological response (12SVR). The 12SVR (93.5%) was comparable with that typically observed in cirrhotic patients without hemoglobinopathies. Three patients died during the period of observation of causes unrelated to DAAs. One patient did not achieve a virological response and five (3.6%) relapsed during 12 weeks of follow-up after the end of therapy. In addition, patients showed significant reductions in serum ferritin at 12 weeks to levels similar to those observed in a control group of 39 patients with thalassemia major without HCV infection, who adhered to chelation therapy and had no overt iron overload. In conclusion, the use of DAAs appears to be safe and effective in patients with hemoglobinopathies and advanced liver disease due to HCV."
10004,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become the gold standard treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a serious adverse effect of HAART. The mechanisms underlying NRTI-induced mitochondriopathy involve the inhibition of the human DNA polymerase gamma mtDNA mutations and oxidative stress. The clinical spectrum of NRTI-related toxicity ranges from a subclinical disease e.g. mild hepatic abnormalities, to a rare life-threatening condition with lactic acidosis and hepatic insufficiency. In the latter, liver histology shows massive steatosis. Ultrastructural assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities may be of help to address the NRTI toxicity in poorly symptomatic patients. Efforts have been recently made to assess the clinical relevance of non-invasive tests including the evaluation of mtDNA or mitochondrial functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the diagnosis of NRTI-associated toxicity."
3509,0.001,1.0000,"There are approximately 240 million patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "
2158,0.001,1.0000,"Evidence suggests that CD8+ T lymphocytes are involved in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in vivo, either by cytolytic mechanisms or by the release of HIV-suppressive factors (HIV-SF). The chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were identified as the major HIV-SF produced by CD8+ T cells. Two active proteins purified from the culture supernatant of an immortalized CD8+ T cell clone revealed sequence identity with human RANTES and MIP-1 alpha. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were released by both immortalized and primary CD8+ T cells. HIV-SF activity produced by these cells was completely blocked by a combination of neutralizing antibodies against RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta. Recombinant human RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These data may have relevance for the prevention and therapy of AIDS."

Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra Leone displayed the lowest seroprevalence (0.021%) of HIV-2 infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported seroprevalence in SIVsm-infected feral and household pet sooty mangabeys. Heteroduplex analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found HIV-1 strains belonged to subtype A, the most common HIV-1 subtype in Africa, but this is the first report of subtype A in Sierra Leone. The two HIV-2-infected individuals harbored two distinct HIV-2 strains, designated 93SL1 and 93SL2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HIV-2 93SL1 is a member of HIV-2 subtype A, the first strain of this HIV-2 subtype found in Sierra Leone. In contrast, HIV-2 93SL2 belongs to none of the five previously characterized HIV-2 subtypes (A to E) but is a new subtype, herein designated F, having the most divergent transmembrane sequences yet reported for HIV-2. The fact that both of the two most divergent HIV-2 subtypes known, E and F, are rare and found as single occurrences in persons from Sierra Leone may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains free-living and household pet sooty mangabeys with highly divergent variants of SIVsm. This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new HIV-2 subtypes result from independent cross-species transmission of SIVsm to the human population and that these single-occurrence transmission events had not spread widely into the population by 1993."
4993,0.001,1.0000,"Forty-seven bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from 16 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were used to test the latency model of Pneumocystis infection in the human host. Identification of DNA sequence polymorphisms at 4 independent loci were used to genotype Pneumocystis jiroveci from the 35 samples that contained detectable P. jiroveci DNA. Eighteen of those 35 samples came from patients who did not have Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and had confirmed alternative diagnoses. Seven patients had asymptomatic carriage of P. jiroveci over periods of < or = 9.5 months after an episode of PCP, and in all 7 cases, a change in genotype from that in the original episode of PCP was observed. The absence of P. jiroveci DNA in one-fourth of the 47 samples and the observed changes in genotype during asymptomatic carriage do not support the latency model of infection. Asymptomatic carriage in HIV-infected patients may play a role in transmission of P. jiroveci and may even supply a reservoir for future infections."
3179,0.001,1.0000,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."

This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of HIV infection among Tuberculosis (TB) confirmed patients on admission at a TB referral centre. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture from 257 TB patients and their HIV status determined. Viral antibody detection was carried out using ELISA kits which detected both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and confirmed by Western blot. Of the 257 patients screened, 44.20% (106) were HIV positive. The prevalence of co-infection was higher among the female (44.82%) than the male (38.30%) patients and highest among those aged 21-40 years old (45.30%). Co-infection was found to be statistically highly associated with gender and age (p<0.05). A very high prevalence of HIV infection was reported in this study among patients that were on admission on the grounds that they had only TB. It is therefore important to screen for HIV among all TB patients."

However, the mechanisms remain obscure. We aimed to determine whether HCC-related HBV mutations including 1762T/1764A double mutation and pre-S deletions occur more frequently in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals compared to HBV mono-infected individuals. In this study, the basic core promoter (BCP) and the preS/S regions of HBV isolated from 61 pairs of HBV/HIV co-infected and HBV mono-infected participants were analyzed. We found that the prevalence of HBV isolates with 1762T/1764A and/or preS deletion mutations was 37.7% (95% CI: 29.1-46.3). The prevalence of these mutations in HBV/HIV co-infected group (52.5%, 95% CI: 40.0-65.0) was significantly higher than in the HBV mono-infected group (23.0%, 95% CI: 12.4-33.6) (X"
8247,0.001,1.0000,"French Guiana is the French territory where the HIV epidemic is most preoccupying. In Cayenne, the mother to child HIV transmission rate was 6% in 2006-2008. Despite free testing and treatment, HIV pregnant women often have delayed or insufficient access to care. The aim of this study was to identify predictive factors of antiretroviral treatment<4 weeks in HIV pregnant women in Cayenne (French Guiana) and then to describe their attitudes, practices, and beliefs regarding HIV/AIDS. A case control study was conducted including all deliveries in Cayenne from 2003 to 2010. For each case, a standardized questionnaire including epidemiological, clinical, and biological data was administered. The analysis first described the summary statistics and then bivariate analysis studied the relation of each variable with the outcome. Multivariate analysis adjusted for the confounding factors. Thirty-three women in the first group and 96 in the control group were included in the study. Women born in French Guiana (OR = 5, IC95% = 1.22-20.86, p=0.027) had a high risk of treatment<4 weeks. The other factors associated with treatment<4 weeks in our study were benefiting from food parcels (OR = 12.72, IC95% = 2.07-78.14, p=0.006), consulting a traditional healer when sick (OR = 9.86, IC95% = 2.57-37.88, p= < 0.001), and drug use (OR = 6.27, IC95% = 1.26-31.13, p=0.025). These predictive factors should be considered in prevention programs against mother to child transmission of HIV."

Brushings were obtained between 20 and 35 cm from the incisors. Patients then underwent upper endoscopy with directed brushings and biopsies; esophageal lavage was also done in the first 40 patients. Candida esophagitis was defined as an abnormal appearance of the esophageal mucosa, together with microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae in the endoscopic brushings or invasive candidiasis on biopsy. The presence of oral thrush was also recorded. Candida esophagitis was present in 28 (42%) of the 66 patients. Blind brushings diagnosed candidiasis in 27/28 cases and produced five false positives (sensitivity 96%, specificity 87%). Blind brushing of the esophagus was significantly more sensitive than the presence of oral thrush for the diagnosis of esophageal candidiasis (p = 0.02). Oral thrush was found in only 20/28 cases of Candida esophagitis and in eight patients without Candida (sensitivity 71%, specificity 79%). Esophageal lavage yielded Candida in all cases (sensitivity 100%) but had a poor specificity (64%). We conclude that blind brushing of the esophagus is a rapid, safe, and economical way to diagnose Candida esophagitis in patients with AIDS. This procedure can be performed by primary care physicians with minimal loss of sensitivity and specificity as compared to endoscopy."
6042,0.001,1.0000,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."

A total of 270 pregnant women who visited antenatal clinics from June to September, 1994 were included in the study. Socio-demographic characteristics of the women were retrieved from antenatal care cards. Sera were screened for syphilis and HIV infection by VDRL and ELISA tests respectively. Twenty nine pregnant women (10.7%) were found to be HIV positive. Those living in other villages and rural towns appeared to have a low risk (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.8) of acquiring HIV infection when compared to those living in Debretabor town. Women who were seropositive for syphilis were twice as likely to be positive for HIV. Prevention of HIV transmission to women and infants is a priority health and social concern. Prevention and early recognition and treatment of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) will be important factors in the prevention and control of HIV transmission."
5959,0.001,1.0000,"Efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) is one of the most commonly prescribed antiretroviral drugs. The present article provides a systematic overview and meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing efavirenz and other active drugs currently recommended for treatment of HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive patients. Electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Trip Database) were searched up till 23 December 2013 for randomized controlled clinical trials published as a peer-reviewed papers, and concerning efavirenz-based regimens used as initial treatment for HIV infection. Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review, while twenty-six trials were suitable for the meta-analysis. Efavirenz was compared with drugs from four different classes: NNRTIs other than efavirenz (nevirapine or rilpivirine), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (bPI) and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonists (maraviroc), all of them were added to the background regimen. Results of the current meta-analysis showed that efavirenz-based regimens were equally effective as other recommended regimens based on NNRTI, ritonavir-boosted PI or CCR5 antagonist in terms of efficacy outcomes (disease progression and/or death, plasma viral HIV RNA <50 copies/ml) while statistically significant more patients treated with InSTI achieved plasma viral load <50 copies/ml at week 48. In comparison with both InSTI-based and CCR5-based therapy, efavirenz-based treatment was associated with a higher risk of therapy discontinuation due to adverse events. However, comparisons of efevirenz-based treatment with InSTI-based and CCR5-based therapy were based on a limited number of trials, therefore, conclusions from these two comparisons must be confirmed in further reliable randomized controlled studies. Results of our meta-analysis support the present clinical guidelines for antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected patients, in which efavirenz is one of the most preferred regimens in the analyzed population. Beneficial safety profile of InSTI-based and CCR5-based therapy over efavirenz-based treatment needs further studies. "
471,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate total health care costs and time to occurrence of hospitalization in HIV-infected patients treated according to the 1998 DHHS guidelines in a managed care setting. The study also investigated which patients do not receive guideline treatment. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study design using medical and pharmacy claims data. Data from 1,791 HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral agents between 1 February 1998 and 31 July 1999, including demographic characteristics, medication guideline use, medication adherence and cost of care, were examined. Factors associated with total health care costs and time-to-inpatient admission (as a proxy for patient outcomes) were assessed. Patients receiving guideline (HAART) therapy (55%) had higher prescription and total health care costs but lower medical costs. Patients not receiving treatment according to guidelines were more likely to be female, older, have comorbidities, lower medication adherence and no AIDS-defining illness. Treatment with HAART guidelines was associated with longer time-to-inpatient admission controlling for other factors. In a short-term cross-sectional analysis, patients treated with HAART guidelines had better outcomes based on time-to-inpatient admission but higher prescription and total health care costs. Some patients are at risk for not receiving care according to national treatment guidelines and may be targeted for intervention programmes."
9564,0.001,1.0000,"Clinicians in Madrid have been observing and treating HIV-positive patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) for over a decade. As their records cover some of the co-infection cases that occurred before and after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced into Spain, retrospective analysis of the records has allowed some of the effects of HAART on local VL to be determined. Encouragingly, HAART appears to have decreased the annual incidence of VL among local AIDS cases, from 4.81 cases/100 to just 0.8 case/100 (P <0.0005), a first episode of VL now appearing only when there is obvious HAART failure. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be very good at preventing VL relapses; within 24 months of antileishmanial treatment, 70% of patients who were receiving HAART had such relapses. The mean time between antileishmanial treatment and VL relapse was, however, longer when HAART was used than when it was not (20 v. 13 months). In those receiving HAART, relapses of the VL often occurred despite increasing CD4+ cell counts and undetectable HIV loads, indicating that successful treatment of the viral infection is insufficient to prevent the relapse of the leishmaniasis. These results are in general agreement with other observations made in Spain. VL relapses are possible and even frequent in HIV-positives who have no more than 200 CD4+ cells/microl, but secondary prophylaxis to prevent VL relapses may be safely suspended if a CD4+ count of >200 cells/microl can be maintained using HAART. VL also seems to hamper the immunological recovery of the HIV-positive, although HAART appears to have little effect on the clinical manifestations of VL."
1902,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral regimens based on human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors (PIs) are hampered by a number of side effects, mainly diarrhea, dyslipidemia, an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes, and lipoaccumulation in the neck and abdomen. Although challenged by these potential untoward effects, PIs are still the cornerstone of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because of their potency and high genetic barrier. Atazanavir (ATV) is the first once-daily azapeptide HIV-1 PI and can be boosted by ritonavir. The efficacy of ritonavir-boosted ATV (ATV/r)-containing regimens in patients harboring drug-resistant variants is not statistically different from that of the reference PI lopinavir/ritonavir. In Italy, ATV, either boosted or unboosted, is licensed only for drug-experienced patients. However, in clinical trials ATV/r has proved to be effective in treatment-naive HIV-1-infected individuals. There is no evidence that ATV/r-based regimens lead to the selection of mutations conferring cross-resistance to other PIs, and this drug combination has now been included among those recommended by the International AIDS Society-USA Panel and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Panel as initial treatment when a boosted-PI-based regimen is preferred to a NNRTI-based regimen."

The overall prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection was 51% (CI: 46.1 - 55.8), with 7.9% (CI: 5.3 - 10.5) for HBsAg, 45.1% (CI: 40.3 - 49.9) for anti-HBc and 32.3% (CI: 27.5 - 36.8) for anti-HBs. After adjustment using logistic regression, hepatitis B serological markers were associated with the following variables: age, marital status and sexual preference. The frequency of hepatitis B markers was 28.7% in heterosexuals and 68.8% in homo/bisexuals (CI: 3.50 - 9.08; OR: 5.63; p=0.000). In married people the frequency was 31% and 58.7% in single people (CI: 1.29 - 3.63); OR: 2.16; p=0.003).

The sample consisted of 272 IDUs enrolled in the AjUDE-Brasil I Project, a cross-sectional multi-center study conducted in five Brazilian cities in 1998. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire using self-reported risk behavior, and HCV and HIV serological status used ELISA on filter paper. IDUs were clustered in four distinct groups: HCV/HIV seronegative; HCV mono-infected; HIV mono-infected; and HCV/HIV co-infected. Active sharing of injecting equipment was associated with HCV infection (p = 0.001). Sexual behavior variables, especially male same-sex sexual relations, were consistently associated with HIV infection. HCV/HIV co-infection was associated with both sexual and drug use variables. It was possible to distinguish different behavioral indicators for HCV and HIV infection and co-infection in this population."
6974,0.001,1.0000,"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis receive multiple blood transfusions and, thus, are susceptible to infections transmitted through blood and blood products, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Baltimore and Boston in 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study. Repeatedly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot analysis. Among 435 patients in Baltimore, 12 (2.8%) were seropositive by both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Among 90 patients in Boston, three (3.3%) were seropositive. Among 100 frozen serum samples obtained from another Boston hemodialysis population in 1980, only one was seropositive. Many repeatedly ELISA-positive specimens were observed in each of the three groups studied, especially the serum samples that had been stored at -30 degrees C to -70 degrees C for four years. Most were nonspecifically reactive as demonstrated by reactivity with an H9-control ELISA plate. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, many of whom have received frequent transfusions in the past, are at increased risk for prior infection with HIV. Serologic testing for either screening or case-finding purposes must be conducted with great attention to specificity; serum samples frozen for prolonged periods are especially likely to be nonspecifically ELISA positive. These findings have implications concerning case-finding purposes, dialysis procedures, renal transplantation, and seroepidemiologic research."
2958,0.001,1.0000,"The life expectancy of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission has important clinical and public health significance. Several sources of population-based surveillance data from New York City, covering 1982 through the end of 1994, were combined to estimate long-term survival of HIV-infected children and age-specific prevalence. HIV incidence among newborns was estimated by applying expected transmission rates to seroprevalence surveys of parturient women and by using back-calculation methods. HIV prevalence in childhood was based on cumulative HIV incidence and cumulative mortality, adjusting for underreporting of death and background causes of death. A modified actuarial method was developed to estimate survival of infected children. At the beginning of 1995, between 1,945 and 3,323 children less than age 13 years were estimated to be living with HIV infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission in New York City. Between 36% and 61% of these infected children were estimated to survive to age 13 years (median survival, 8.6 years to >13 years). A substantial proportion of infected children will survive to adolescence. Thus, it is important that their educational, medical, and other needs be considered. These methods may be useful in other areas in which HIV seroprevalence data among childbearing women and HIV mortality statistics are available."
8576,0.001,1.0000,"We have evaluated the efficacy of treatment with recombinant Interferon-2b (IFN-2b) in 12 children with cancer who developed chronic hepatitis-B infection. Seven of them had lymphoblastic leukaemia and others had solid tumours. Seven cases were male. Mean age was 10.5 years with a range of 5-16 years. Chronic Hepatitis B was diagnosed biochemically, serologically and histopathologically. They were HBsAg(+), HBV-DNA(+), and HCV(-), HIV(-). Seven cases were HBeAg(+) and two of them were anti-Delta IgG(+). Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis in six cases and persistent hepatitis in three cases. IFN was given at the dose of 5 MU/m2 three times a week, subcutaneously for 6 months. It was well tolerated. After IFN therapy, ALT levels returned to normal in seven cases. All cases were still HBsAg(+). Four of them seroconverted to anti-HBe antibody. Loss of serum HBV-DNA in three cases, but 11 cases showed a marked decrease after IFN. The control liver biopsies showed that histopathological activity index was diminished in five cases. Other 16 patients, serving as control, received no therapy. Five of them were leukaemia and others were solid tumours. Twelve cases were male. Mean age was 9.3 years with a range of 4-19 years. After 6 months, only one patient lost HBV-DNA and three of them seroconverted to anti-HBe with normalization of ALT values. In our study, IFN treatment favourably influenced the progress of chronic hepatitis B in children with cancer."
971,0.001,1.0000,"During 2 periods between 1997 and 1999, the Aproco-Copilote (ANRS CO 008) cohort enrolled all HIV-infected patients who began antiretroviral therapy containing a PI in 47 French centers and who volunteered to participate (1281 patients) in order to describe and analyze their long-term clinical course and the benefits of treatment. Complete adherence (more than 95% of drugs actually taken) during the first 4 months of therapy appears crucial in maintaining virological response to therapy over time. Adherence depends on how patients experience the treatment but also on external factors such as their relationship with physicians and social workers. Virological failures were classified in two groups: those sensitive to the PI prescribed and related to poor adherence (no detectable PI) or patients with resistance related to pharmacokinetic issues (detectable but insufficient PI levels). Between April 1997 and May 2004, 118 patients died, and 188 episodes of AIDS and 1178 other severe events were recorded. Follow-up at 5 years was estimated at 90% and the probability of progression towards a new episode of AIDS 16%. Risk of AIDS onset was greatest during the first year and declined thereafter. Severe morbidity unrelated to AIDS or the side effects of treatment was frequent and gradually predominated. The only patients for whom AIDS was the most frequent severe morbidity were those who started treatment with CD4 cell counts < 50/mm3. The cumulative probability of a serious antiretroviral-induced adverse event (mainly hypertransaminasemia) was 30% at 5 years; 2/3 of these events occurred during the first 6 months of follow-up. Factors associated with the 169 events attributed to the first PI prescribed included: plasma HIV RNA >100,000 copies/ml, increased transaminase levels, creatinine clearance <70 ml/min, HCV or HBV co-infection, and prescription of indinavir. Other studies are underway on the associated factors specific to each of the events to delineate the respective roles of the virus, the treatments and other factors."
5048,0.001,1.0000,"HIV eradication is not feasible and lifelong treatment is warranted to manage HIV infection. In this scenario, the advent of single-tablet, once-daily, fixed-dose co-formulations is important for reducing pill burden and maximize long-term drug adherence. Cobicistat-boosted darunavir along with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide co-formulation (DRV/c/FTC/TAF or the trade name Symtuza®) is the first marketed protease inhibitor-based fixed-dose combination regimen for the treatment of HIV infection. It was approved in late 2017 by the European Medical Agency both for naïve patients and treatment-experienced patients with viral suppression. Areas covered: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and presentations at scientific meetings were searched with the terms 'darunavir/cobicistat' and 'tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine' for clinical trials either conducted to date or ongoing as well as a review of abstracts from major HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases conferences from 2015 to up to date. Expert opinion: DRV/c/FTC/TAF is a novel unique antiretroviral drug co-formulation that exhibits a convenient dosing, satisfactory safety profile, and high antiviral efficacy, even in patients harboring viruses with resistance to antivirals other than darunavir in the short-midterm. It represents the first fixed-dose combination therapy including a protease inhibitor given as one single pill once daily for drug-naïve patients and as second-line antiretroviral therapy."
5432,0.001,1.0000,"Clinical observation shows pregnant women under antiretroviral therapy present bleeding episodes at delivery, although this therapy promotes a decrease in fibrinolysis in nonpregnant patients, suggesting a prothrombotic state in the former. Since these drugs provoke hepatic disorders, they can cause bleeding disturbances. We investigated effects of antiretroviral therapy on hemostasis in pregnant women. Two groups were studied: pregnant women with HIV (n = 11), and (control) pregnant women without HIV (n = 7). Four blood samples were collected from each individual in both groups: one at the beginning of pregnancy before treatment, two during pregnancy and therapy, and one 6 weeks after delivery. Treatment was performed according to recommendations of the Brazilian Health Department for the evaluation of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, factors VII, X, and XII, fibrinogen concentration, protein C, protein S, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrin degradation products (FbDPs). Statistical analysis demonstrated pregnancy caused increased factor VII (P = 0.0313), factor X (P = 0.0156) and factor XII (P = 0.0156) activity, fibrinogen concentration (P = 0.0156), t-PA (P = 0.0313), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P = 0.0156) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0313). HIV infection caused increased factor XII (P = 0.0114), t-PA (P = 0.0346) and FbDPs (P = 0.0003), and decreased protein S levels (P = 0.0441). Antiretroviral therapy reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.0114) and protein S (P = 0.0012), and increased t-PA (P = 0. 0204) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0154). The results suggest a prothrombic state developing during pregnancy, maintenance of hemostatic equilibrium in HIV infection and occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis, not due to hepatotoxicity, during antiretroviral therapy, causing the clinically observed bleeding episodes."

A total of 305 HIV-1-infected patients who received 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (vaccinees) and 203 patients who did not (non-vaccinees) were prospectively observed between 1 June 2000 and 31 October 2002. Changes of CD4+ and plasma viral load (PVL) from baseline to week 4 of vaccination were assessed in 31 randomly selected vaccinees. The incidence of pneumococcal disease and bacteremia of vaccinees was 2.1 per 1000 patient-years (PY) (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-2.5 per 1000 PY) over the median observation of 641 days (range, 37-832 days) following vaccination while that of non-vaccinee was 21.8 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 20.1-23.7 per 1000 PY) and 7.3 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 7.0-7.6 per 1000 PY), respectively, over the observation of 500 days (range, 32-851 days), with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for developing pneumococcal disease of 0.085 (95% CI, 0.010-0.735) and for bacteremia of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.018-2.561). The median CD4+ count increased by 45 x 10(6) l(-1) (P = 0.01) and median PVL change was 0 log(10) copies/ml (range of decrease, -0.74 to 2.47 log(10) copies/ml) after 1 month of pneumococcal vaccination among the subgroup of 31 vaccinees receiving HAART. The median CD4+ count increase from baseline to the end of study was 149 x 10(6) l(-1) for vaccinees and 107 x 10(6) l(-1) for non-vaccinees (P = 0.21). The AOR of developing all-cause community-acquired pneumonia and new AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (OI) of vaccinees as compared to non-vaccinees was 1.876 (95% CI, 0.785-4.485) and 0.567 (95% CI, 0.217-1.484), respectively. Death rate of vaccinees and non-vaccinees was 17.7 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 16.5-18.9 per 1000 PY) and 80.5 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 77.1-83.9 per 1000 PY), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio for death of vaccinees as compared with non-vaccinees was 0.733 (95% CI, 0.236-2.274). Our data suggested that vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and receipt of HAART were associated with reduced risks for pneumococcal disease among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART. Vaccination did not increase the risks of all-cause community-acquired pneumonia, HIV progression, and mortality. Vaccination did not increase PVL or decrease CD4+ among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART."
5370,0.001,1.0000,"Evaluation of drug resistance by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping has proven to be useful for the selection of drug combinations with maximum antiretroviral activity. We compared three genotyping methods for identification of mutations known to confer drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-GenotypR method (GenotypR; Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.) with the ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), the HIV PRT GeneChip assay (GeneChip; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.), and the HIV-1 RT Line Probe Assay (LiPA; Innogenetics, Alpharetta, Ga.) were used to genotype plasma samples from HIV-infected patients attending the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics and the Mayo Clinic. At the time of analysis, patients were failing combination therapy (n = 18) or were treatment naive (n = 6). Forty codons of the RT and protease genes were analyzed by GenotypR and GeneChip for resistance-associated mutations. LiPA analyzed seven RT codons for mutations. Each sample was genotyped by all three assays, and each assay was subjected to pairwise comparisons. At least 92% of the codons tested (by the three assays) in paired comparisons were concordant. GenotypR and GeneChip demonstrated 96.6% concordance over the 40 codons tested. GenotypR identified slightly more mutations than GeneChip and LiPA; GeneChip identified all primary mutations that corresponded to failing treatment regimens. Each assay identified at least 84% of the mutations identified by the other assays. Mutations that were discordant between the assays mainly comprised secondary mutations and natural polymorphisms. The assays had better concordance for mutations that corresponded to current failing regimens, present in the more predominant viral quasispecies. In the treatment-naive patients, GenotypR, GeneChip, and LiPA mainly identified wild-type virus. Only the LiPA identified K70R, a possible transmitted zidovudine resistance mutation, in the RT gene of a treatment-naive patient. We conclude that although discrepancies in results exist between assays, each assay showed a similar capacity to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations related to patient treatment regimens."
6983,0.001,1.0000,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are prevalent worldwide, and share similar means of transmission. These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

3269,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cause a large proportion of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Over the past decades many immunological studies defined host immune responses that mediate spontaneous clearance of acute HBV and HCV infection. However, host immune responses are also relevant in the context of treatment-induced clearance of chronic HBV and HCV infection. First, the pretreatment level of interferon-stimulated genes as well as genetic determinants of innate immune responses, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms near the IFNL3 gene, are strong predictors of the response to interferon-alpha (IFN-α)-based therapy. Second, IFN-α, which has been a mainstay of HBV and HCV therapy over decades, and ribavirin, which has also been included in interferon-free direct antiviral therapy for HCV, modulate host immune responses. Third, both IFN-α-based and IFN-α-free treatment regimens of HBV and HCV infection alter the short-term and long-term adaptive immune response against these viruses. Finally, treatment studies have not just improved the clinical outcomes, but also provided opportunities to study virus-host interaction. This review summarizes our current knowledge on how a patient's immune response affects the treatment outcome of HBV and HCV infection and how innate and adaptive immune responses themselves are altered by the different treatment regimens."
50,0.001,1.0000,"This study explores whether previous failures on antiretroviral drug regimens preclude the possibility of immune restoration. This was assessed by evaluating T cell subset changes in individuals who received a salvage regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after initially failing protease inhibitor monotherapy. Ten HIV-1-infected asymptomatic patients received a regimen of indinavir, zidovudine, and 3TC after failing saquinavir monotherapy. Changes in absolute numbers of naive, memory, and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing a selection of CD45RA, CD62L, CD45RO, HLA-DR, and CD38 markers were monitored prospectively over 6 months. These measurements were correlated with plasma viral load along with alterations in a selected CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Over 6 months there was a progressive increase in numbers of CD4+ memory (CD45RA-CD62L+) and naive (CD45RA+CD62L+) T cells, which displayed a modest inverse correlation with viral load. Two phases of CD8+ memory cell changes were identified, consisting of a transient increase in CD45RA+CD62L- numbers after 2 months and thereafter a progressive rise in CD45RA-CD62L+ cells until 6 months. A strong correlation existed between reduced viral load and loss of activated CD8+CD38+HLA-DR+ cell numbers. There was also a temporary broadening of the CD8+ V alpha/Vbeta TCR repertoire at 8 weeks, which became skewed after 6 months in parallel with reduced viral suppression. Closer analysis of naive and memory cell subset proportions in individual patients revealed that enlarged pools of naive subsets were evident in those patients with rebounds in viral load. Overall, drug-experienced patients responding to HAART displayed increased numbers of naive and memory CD4+ subsets, and reduced CD8+ cell activation with a loss of TCR skewing."
4082,0.001,1.0000,"Whether highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) impacts responses to 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PV) is not known. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels for 6 capsular polysaccharides in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who had received > or =6 months of HAART were measured either after their first dose of PV (n=46) or after revaccination (n=41); control subjects had never received HAART and had received the first dose of PV (n=38). There were no significant differences in pre- or postvaccination IgG levels among these groups but for 1 capsular polysaccharide. The 3 groups had significant postvaccination increases in IgG levels to all capsular polysaccharides. The control group had a greater number of 2-fold responses than did the combined HAART groups (P<.05). Patients with a CD4 cell count of > or =200 cells/mm3 had a greater number of 2-fold responses than did those with a CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (P<.05). For revaccinated patients, postvaccination IgG levels were correlated with the CD4 cell count at the initial vaccination. The immunogenicity of PV among patients receiving long-term HAART is modest. It seems best to immunize HIV-infected patients early in the course of disease."
3296,0.001,1.0000,"There have been reported cases of long-term symptomless human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but it is not clear whether the benign course of infection was due to host, viral, or other unknown factors. During follow-up of subjects with transfusion-acquired HIV-1 infection in New South Wales, Australia, we identified a group of 6 subjects who had been infected through a single common donor. We were therefore able to study the contributions of various factors to the course of infection. Throughout follow-up (range 6.8-10.1 years after infection), 5 of the recipients and the donor (last follow-up 10.2 years after infection of the first recipient) remained clinically free of symptoms, with normal CD4 cell counts and no p24 antigenaemia. HIV-1 was isolated from only 1 recipient; the isolate did not induce syncytia in a SUPT1 co-culture assay and had a limited in-vitro host range. 1 infected recipient (who had received extensive immunosuppressive treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus) developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died 4.3 years after infection. The frequency of progression to AIDS or a CD4 cell count below 0.50 x 10(9)/l was significantly lower among the 6 subjects with a common donor (1/6) than among 101 other HIV-infected transfusion recipients for whom data from 7 years of follow-up were available (94/101; p less than 0.0001). These findings suggest that the subjects were infected by a less virulent strain of HIV-1. The identification of this group of subjects should stimulate a search for other similar groups, which will provide important information on the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
6024,0.001,1.0000,"The selection of escape mutations has a major impact on immune control of infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral evasion of CD8(+) T-cell responses leaves predictable combinations of escape mutations, termed HLA ""footprints."" The most clearly defined footprints are those associated with HLA alleles that are linked with successful control of HIV, such as HLA-B*57. Here we investigated the extent to which HLA footprint sites in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with viral evolution among and within clades. First, we examined the extent to which amino acid differences between HIV-1 clades share identity with sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and observed a strong association, in particular with respect to sites of HLA-B selection (P < 10(-6)). Similarly, the sites of amino acid variability within a clade were found to overlap with sites of HLA-selected mutation. Second, we studied the impact of HLA selection on interclade phylogeny. Removing the sites of amino acid variability did not significantly affect clade-specific clustering, reflecting the central role of founder effects in establishing distinct clades. However, HLA footprints may underpin founder strains, and we show that amino acid substitutions between clades alter phylogeny, underlining a potentially substantial role for HLA in driving ongoing viral evolution. Finally, we investigated the impact of HLA selection on within-clade phylogeny and demonstrate that even a single HLA allele footprint can result in significant phylogenetic clustering of sequences. In conclusion, these data highlight the fact that HLA can be a strong selection force for both intra- and interclade HIV evolution at a population level."
7731,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Due to its error-prone replication via reverse transcription, HBV can rapidly evolve variants that escape vaccination and/or become resistant to CHB treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs). This is particularly problematic for the first generation NAs lamivudine and adefovir. Though now superseded by more potent NAs, both are still widely used. Furthermore, resistance against the older NAs can contribute to cross-resistance against more advanced NAs. For lack of feasible HBV infection systems, the biology of such variants is not well understood. From the recent discovery of Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor new in vitro infection systems are emerging, yet access to the required large amounts of virions, in particular variants, remains a limiting factor. Stably HBV producing cell lines address both issues by allowing to study intracellular viral replication and as a permanent source of defined virions. Accordingly, we generated a panel of new tetracycline regulated TetOFF HepG2 hepatoma cell lines which produce six lamivudine and adefovir resistance-associated and two vaccine escape variants of HBV as well as the model virus woolly monkey HBV (WMHBV). The cell line-borne viruses reproduced the expected NA resistance profiles and all were equally sensitive against a non-NA drug. The new cell lines should be valuable to investigate under standardized conditions HBV resistance and cross-resistance. With titers of secreted virions reaching >3 x 10(7) viral genome equivalents per ml they should also facilitate exploitation of the new in vitro infection systems."
4989,0.001,1.0000,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a leading target in current antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, drug-resistant RT mutants evolve under the pressure of these drugs, and therefore, new anti-RT inhibitors are constantly required for HIV-1/AIDS treatment. We virtually screened a large chemical library of compounds against two crystal structures of HIV-1 RT to identify novel inhibitors. Top-scoring compounds were tested experimentally; 71 inhibited the RT-associated DNA polymerase, while several also inhibited HIV-1 pseudovirus infection in a cell-based assay. A combination of substituents from two structurally related inhibitors in a single molecule improved the inhibition efficacy. This compound strongly suppressed the RT-associated activity also protecting human lymphocytes from HIV-1 infection. RT inhibition by this compound was reversible and noncompetitive. This molecule and another structurally unrelated potent compound inhibited a known drug-resistant mutant of HIV-1 RT and affected moderately the HIV-2 RT-associated DNA polymerase. These inhibitors may serve as promising anti-HIV lead compounds."
9379,0.001,1.0000,"The destruction of CD4 T cells in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with activation of apoptotic programs, partly mediated by death receptors. The role of CD95L/CD95 in depletion of patients' CD4 T cells is well documented, but the possible contribution of the tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF/TNFR) pathway has not been examined. In this study, we found that both TNFR1 and TNFR2 induced marked apoptosis in peripheral T cells from HIV-infected persons, involving both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Longitudinal follow-up of HIV(+) patients suggests an association between the in vivo evolution of CD4 T-cell numbers and variations in susceptibility to TNFR-induced apoptosis. Analysis of molecular mechanisms involved showed that it was not related to altered ex vivo expression of TNFR1-associated death domain, receptor interacting protein, or TNFR-associated factor 2. Susceptibility to TNFR-mediated apoptosis was rather related to Bcl-2 expression, because patients' T cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 were completely protected from TNFR1- and TNFR2-induced cell death, whereas T cells expressing normal levels of Bcl-2 were not protected in patients in contrast to controls. Early recruitment of caspase-8 and caspase-3 is needed to transduce the apoptotic signals, and expression of both caspases in their active form was detected in blood T cells from HIV(+) patients, whereas it was hardly detected in controls. Moreover, ligation of TNFRs induced increased activation of both caspases in patients' T cells. Together these data demonstrate that exacerbated TNFR-mediated cell death of T cells from HIV-infected individuals is associated with both alteration of Bcl-2 expression and activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 and may contribute to the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
8815,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). With nearly 750000 deaths yearly, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second highest cause of cancer-related death in the world. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of HBV-associated HCC remain incompletely understood. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs), a family of small non-coding RNAs that play a role primarily in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been recognized as important regulators of cellular homeostasis, and altered regulation of miRNA expression has been suggested to play a significant role in virus-associated diseases and the development of many cancers. With this in mind, many groups have begun to investigate the relationship between miRNAs and HBV replication and HBV-associated disease. Multiple findings suggest that some miRNAs, such as miR-122, and miR-125 and miR-199 family members, are playing a role in HBV replication and HBV-associated disease, including the development of HBV-associated HCC. In this review, we discuss the current state of our understanding of the relationship between HBV and miRNAs, including how HBV affects cellular miRNAs, how these miRNAs impact HBV replication, and the relationship between HBV-mediated miRNA regulation and HCC development. We also address the impact of challenges in studying HBV, such as the lack of an effective model system for infectivity and a reliance on transformed cell lines, on our understanding of the relationship between HBV and miRNAs, and propose potential applications of miRNA-related techniques that could enhance our understanding of the role miRNAs play in HBV replication and HBV-associated disease, ultimately leading to new therapeutic options and improved patient outcomes.

3947,0.001,1.0000,"Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection can cause a severe lethal hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans. CD8(+) T cells play a critical role in combating HTNV infections. However, the contributions of different CD8(+) T cell subsets to the immune response against viral infection are poorly understood. Here, we identified a novel subset of CD8(+) T cells characterized by the CD8(low) CD100(-) phenotype in HFRS patients. The CD8(low) CD100(-) subset accounted for a median of 14.3% of the total CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS, and this percentage subsequently declined in the late phase of infection, whereas this subset was absent in healthy controls. Furthermore, the CD8(low) CD100(-) cells were associated with high activation and expressed high levels of cytolytic effector molecules and exhibited a distinct expression profile of effector CD8(+) T cells (CCR7(+/-) CD45RA(-) CD127(high) CD27(int) CD28(low) CD62L(-)). When stimulated with specific HTNV nucleocapsid protein-derived peptide pools, most responding CD8(+) cells (gamma interferon [IFN-γ] positive and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] positive) were CD8(low) CD100(-) cells. The frequency of CD8(low) CD100(-) cells among HTNV-specific CD8(+) T cells was higher in milder cases than in more severe cases. Importantly, the proportion of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset among CD8(+) T cells in early phase of HFRS was negatively correlated with the HTNV viral load, suggesting that CD8(low) CD100(-) cells may be associated with viral clearance. The contraction of the CD8(low) CD100(-) subset in late phase of infection may be related to the consistently high expression levels of PD-1. These results may provide new insights into our understanding of CD8(+) T cell-mediated protective immunity as well as immune homeostasis after HTNV infection in humans."
7189,0.001,1.0000,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) is essential for innate intracellular immune defenses that limit virus replication, but these defenses fail to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which can ultimately associate with opportunistic coinfections and the progression to AIDS. Here, we examined antiviral defenses in CD4+ cells during virus infection and coinfection, revealing that HIV type 1 (HIV-1) directs a global disruption of innate immune signaling and supports a coinfection model through suppression of IRF-3. T cells responded to paramyxovirus infection to activate IRF-3 and interferon-stimulated gene expression, but they failed to mount a response against HIV-1. The lack of response associated with a marked depletion of IRF-3 but not IRF-7 in HIV-1-infected cells, which supported robust viral replication, whereas ectopic expression of active IRF-3 suppressed HIV-1 infection. IRF-3 depletion was dependent on a productive HIV-1 replication cycle and caused the specific disruption of Toll-like receptor and RIG-I-like receptor innate immune signaling that rendered cells permissive to secondary virus infection. IRF-3 levels were reduced in vivo within CD4+ T cells from patients with acute HIV-1 infection but not from long-term nonprogressors. Our results indicate that viral suppression of IRF-3 promotes HIV-1 infection by disrupting IRF-3-dependent signaling pathways and innate antiviral defenses of the host cell. IRF-3 may direct an innate antiviral response that regulates HIV-1 replication and viral set point while governing susceptibility to opportunistic virus coinfections."
7335,0.001,1.0000,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."
5566,0.001,1.0000,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."

This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months.

7692,0.001,1.0000,"This study sought to determine the prevalence and risk factors of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count ≤ 350 cells/μL in Shanghai, China. Subjects were 309 HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count ≤ 350 cells/μL. General demographic and clinical information were collected by patient interview. Patients' cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), combined with a questionnaire on cognitive complaints. The median age of patients was 34 years (IQR: 28-43.5). In terms of sex, 272 (88.0%) of the patients were male. Of the patients, 236 (76.4%) had been on antiretroviral treatment (ART) (for a median duration of 14 months, IQR: 1-29 months) before the study. Of the patients, 183 (59.2%) mentioned having a cognitive disorder. MoCA screening revealed that the prevalence of HAND was 48.2% and that HAND was more prevalent in patients with cognitive complaints (53.0%) than in patients with no such complaints (41.3%) (p = 0.042). Multivariate analysis indicated that HAND was associated with being female (p = 0.006), being older (p < 0.001), having a lower level of education (p < 0.001), and longer use of efavirenz in an ART regimen (p = 0.040). This study found that HAND frequently developed in HIV-infected patients with a baseline CD4 count ≤ 350 cells/μL in Shanghai, China. Being older, being female, having a low level of education, and receiving efavirenz treatment for a longer period may be associated with a greater risk of developing HAND. This study suggests that HAND should be routinely screened for in all newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients, and especially in those with the aforementioned risk factors for developing HAND. "
6514,0.001,1.0000,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
692,0.001,1.0000,"Given the continued high incidence of HIV infection in the United States among racial/ethnic minority young men who have sex with men (YMSM), and an appreciation that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can provide personal and public health benefits, attention is needed to enhance the detection of HIV-infected youth and engage them in medical care and support services that encourage sustained HIV treatment and suppression of viremia. Poor retention in clinical care has been associated with higher mortality, an increase in HIV RNA, and decreased CD4 cell count. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the health care utilization and health outcomes of HIV-infected racial/ethnic minority YMSM enrolled in an outreach, linkage, and retention study funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). We hypothesized that among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, baseline CD4 counts and usage of ART are influenced by age, race, drug and alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. Overall, 155 subjects had at least a baseline CD4 count recorded at study entry. There was a low rate of ART use in this population with only one-half of the cohort with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm(3) being prescribed ART to treat their infection. However, of those youth who were started on ART, the majority (74%) did achieve undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies). Given the continued increase in cases of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, efforts to increase both the provision of ART and support services that encourage adherence in this population are warranted."
1506,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has increased the survival of patients with HIV/AIDS, thus necessitating health promotion practice with immunization. Vaccines are critical components for protecting people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purpose of study was to analyze the vaccination status of PLWHA in outpatient care in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil. Cross-sectional study performed from June 2014 to June 2015. The screening was done with patients in antiretroviral therapy, 420 patients underwent screening, but only 99 met the inclusion criteria. Data were collected for interviews using forms to characterize sociodemographic, clinical and vaccination situations. Only 14 patients had complete vaccination schedules. The most used vaccines were hepatitis B, influenza vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal. There was no difference between men and women regarding the proportion of PLWHA with full vaccination schedule or between sex, skin color, marital status, sexual orientation, religion or occupational status. There was no difference between having or not having a complete vaccination schedule and age, years of education, family income or number of hospitalizations. CD4+ T-cells count of patients with incomplete immunization was lower than patients with complete immunization. Health education strategies can be done individually or in groups to explain the importance of vaccination and to remind about doses to be administered. Most patients did not have proper adherence to vaccination schedules, especially due to lack of guidance. Results implied that education in health is important for vaccination adhesion, knowledge of adverse events and continuation of schemes. "
6386,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and analyze its determinants among Cambodian adults living with HIV/AIDS who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 150 adults 18 years of age or older from the patient population at the HIV/AIDS care hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV BREF; socio-demographic characteristics, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, months on ART, CD4 cell count, family and community support, depression, and anxiety were included in the survey. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that positive predictors of QOL included being female, being less 40 years old, having a household monthly income greater than 300 USD, having an education beyond the secondary level, or being employed. However, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were not significantly associated with QOL and CD4 cell count and the World Health Organization clinical stage had little association with QOL. Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL. These findings suggest the importance of group-specific interventions to improve the QOL for those people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia who are male, have a low household income or education level, are unemployed, or are anxious or depressed."
6653,0.001,1.0000,"In South Africa, where it is estimated that more people have HIV than anywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS and psychological disorder co-morbidity have been shown both to exacerbate the late diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and to affect adherence to ARVs. Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."
6726,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of circulating immune complexes (CIC), their role and their relationship to cell-mediated immunity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver disease are still controversial. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence of CIC and their relationship to viral markers, to subsets of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and to suppressor cell activity in patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. CIC were positive in 29.3% of 41 healthy HBsAg carriers, 37.8% of 88 patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases, and 15% of 41 healthy subjects by the platelet aggregation test (PAT). The prevalence of CIC in patients with acute hepatitis (40.0%) and in those with cirrhosis (61.5%) was significantly higher than in normal controls (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.005 respectively). There was no correlation between the titer of CIC and serum HBsAg titer or the status of HBeAg, and no significant decrease in the peripheral blood lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio in healthy HBsAg carriers (1.39 +/- 0.31) and in patients with liver diseases (1.40 +/- 0.54) compared to the normal controls (1.48 +/- 0.31). Concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG producing cells was impaired in healthy HBsAg carriers (34.9%) (p less than 0.005) and in patients with liver diseases (25.3%) (p less than 0.0001), and this change was prominent in patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis (p less than 0.0001). And there was a significant reverse correlation between concanavalin A induced suppressor cell activity on IgG-producing cells and the titer of CIC in PAT positive patients with hepatitis B virus associated liver diseases. In conclusion, it was suggested that defective suppressor cell function may lead to an increased B cell activation and such activity may account for the presence of CIC."
3186,0.001,1.0000,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
1900,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with impaired proliferative, cytokine, and cytotoxic effector functions of HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells that probably contribute significantly to viral persistence. Here, we investigated the potential role of T cells with a CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory phenotype in suppressing virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell proliferation during chronic HCV infection. In vitro depletion studies and coculture experiments revealed that peptide specific proliferation as well as gamma interferon production of HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells were inhibited by CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. This inhibition was dose dependent, required direct cell-cell contact, and was independent of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor beta. Interestingly, the T-cell-mediated suppression in chronically HCV-infected patients was not restricted to HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells but also to influenza virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. Importantly, CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from persons recovered from HCV infection and from healthy blood donors exhibited significantly less suppressor activity. Thus, the inhibition of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell proliferation was enhanced in chronically HCV-infected patients. This was associated with a higher frequency of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+) cells observed in this patient group. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic HCV infection leads to the expansion of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells that are able to suppress CD8(+) T-cell responses to different viral antigens. Our results further suggest that CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells may contribute to viral persistence in chronically HCV-infected patients and may be a target for immunotherapy of chronic hepatitis C."
7815,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has many genotypes which are closely associated with the severity of chronic hepatitis and the response to antiviral therapy. Although HCV is essentially hepatotropic, several lines of evidence suggest that this virus can infect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in most patients with chronic HCV infection. However, the methods used previously to detect negative-strand HCV RNA have been questioned, and the PBMC tropism of different HCV genotypes remains unknown. A stringent method was used to investigate the prevalence of positive- and negative-strand HCV RNA in the PBMC of 106 patients with chronic hepatitis C and to analyze the influence of HCV genotype on the tropism of PBMC. HCV type 1b was the predominant strain in the patients. Positive-strand RNA in PBMC was detected in 83 (78%) and 40% had negative-strand RNA. The demographic and clinical features were comparable among different patients grouped by the replication status of HCV in the plasma and PBMC samples. In addition, there was no significant difference of PBMC tropism between type 1b and non-1b HCV. In summary, HCV does indeed infect actively the PBMC of chronic hepatitis C patients and such infection is not correlated to the pathogenesis of liver cell damage. Moreover, the genotype is not associated specifically with PBMC tropism of HCV."
8041,0.001,1.0000,"OLT in HIV infected patients still remains a challenging option requiring a careful monitoring of patients for HCV reinfection, drug interactions and antiretroviral toxicity. Severe adverse events due to HAART have been already reported for post exposure prophylaxis in HIV infected patients. Here we report a case of liver graft toxicity related to HAART in a HIV-HCV co-infected patient (46 yrs-male) with associated a small HCC transplanted with a marginal liver graft. The patient had pre-OLT plasma HIV 1-RNA levels undetectable and CD4+ T-cell count of > 200 cells/microL for 6 months. At day 2 a severe graft dysfunction was observed (AST 1570 U/L, ALT 2180 U/L, BIL tot 8.3 mg/dL, BIL Dir 6.6 mg/dL and PT 35%--INR 2.5). Doppler scan showed hepatic artery always patient. Later the postoperative in-hospital course was complicated by tense ascites and severe cholestasis. Serum bilirubin reached 42 mg/dL in day 12. Hypertransaminasemia ended at day 15 while cholestasis ended after 46 days. Tacrolimus was reintroduced at day 7. A liver biopsy 10 after OLT showed severe intrahepatic cholestasis, centrolobular necrosis and macrovesicular steatosis (30%). The patient was discharged 48 days after OLT with good liver function. After seven months HIV-RNA is still undetectable and HAART has not been restarted. We believe that the early complications we observed may be attributed to a sudden increase in plasma concentration of antiretroviral drugs secondary to drug redistribution from peripheral tissues and hepatic clearance deficiency after OLT. Although a pre-OLT withdrawal of HAART seems unjustified a delayed re-introduction of HAART or the use of less hepatotoxic drugs may be advisable."
2246,0.001,1.0000,"In this report we describe the clinical and laboratory profiles of different opportunistic infections (OIs) among 125 immunocompromised patients admitted to a referral hospital in the eastern part of India. Different pathogens were isolated, identified and characterized using the laboratory gold standard methods. Oral candidiasis (88%) was found to be the most common OI, followed by tuberculosis (57%), enteropathogenic Vibrio (47%), cytomegalovirus infection (45%), cryptosporidial diarrhea (43%), Escherichia coli infection (42%) and other infections among the study subjects. Statistical analysis of the case studies shows 120/cumm median CD4+ blood cell count, and the OIs showed an inversely proportional occurrence to the CD4+ count of the immunocompromised patients. The spectrum and frequency of certain OIs highlight the urgency of studying HIV/AIDS in resource-limited countries where locally specific disease patterns may be observed. The purpose of the present investigation was the identification of such opportunistic pathogens, as we feel the HIV epidemic can be more effectively managed if physicians and health planners are aware of this information."
1710,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
8736,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C, previously termed parenterally transmitted NANB hepatitis, is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus (HCV). Infection with this virus has epidemiologic characteristics similar to hepatitis B, with infection from contaminated blood appearing to be a primary source of disease. Although 80% to 90% of the viral hepatitis associated with blood transfusions used to be the most common mechanism for HCV transmission, parenteral drug abuse has become the major documented risk factor in the United States. Health care workers face occupational hazards for HCV infection primarily through needlestick and other contaminated sharps accidents, although the risks are much lower than those historically documented for HBV. Current universal bloodborne precautions for infection control appear to be effective against occupational cross-infection in patient care settings. Ongoing studies in patients with long-term persistent hepatitis C are investigating the usefulness of prolonged interferon therapy to reduce hepatic damage and HCV chronicity."
4820,0.001,1.0000,"4000 sera were tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by means of an ELISA using the C100-3 antigen. 38.9% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis following blood transfusion (n = 108) had HCV antibodies. Among patients with chronic liver damage of unknown origin (n = 316) 30.4% were anti-HCV positive, and in 2,506 patients with transitional or chronic elevation of transaminases 14.8% showed HCV antibodies. Haemophiliacs (n = 26) with 65.4% anti-HCV positives and drug addicts (n = 46) with 56.5% anti-HCV positives had the highest prevalence among high risk groups. Addicts dying from drug abuse (n = 216) and HIV 1 positives (n = 127) were anti-HCV positive in 37.5% and 26.0%, respectively. Patients on haemodialysis (n = 331) had antibodies against HCV in 12.4%. Health care workers (n = 217) appear to be at a comparably low risk with only 2.8% anti-HCV positives. Up to now we could not find a single case of intrafamilial spread of HCV in 46 examined cases. We suggest that HCV infectivity of contaminated body fluids and blood is lower than that of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 carriers. In suspected non-A, non-B hepatitis negative test results should be confirmed in a second sample because it may take three to six months after infection before HCV antibodies occur. However, about 10% of chronic HCV infections are not detectable with the presently available test. This may change when new tests become available using HCV specific antigens other than C100-3."
6200,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are often associated with extrahepatic immunological manifestations, including various autoimmune disorders. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of HCV markers in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and to determine any relationship with HCV infection. Eighty-three patients with MG. 40 men aged 20-93 years and 43 women aged 13-87 years (mean age 54 years) were studied. The MG patients were positive for antibody to acetylcholine receptor in addition, their sera was analysed for antibody to HCV (HCVAb) and HCV RNA, HCVAb was detected in two of the 83 patients (2.4%). Four patients were repeatedly HCV RNA positive. They were infected by HCV genotype 1 (one patient), HCV genotype 2a (two patients) and an undetermined HCV genotype in one patient. They received plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Among the four patients, one was infected after the onset of MG without receiving a blood transfusion or using intravenous drugs. The other three had chronic hepatitis C which was discovered at the same time as MG and only one patient had been exposed to blood products. The prevalence of HCV markers in patients with MG (4.8%) was higher than that reported for the general French population, about 1%. This prevalence is similar to that occurring in patients exposed to plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin. In conclusion, HCV appears to play little, if any, role in causing MG. The higher prevalence of infection among MG patients may be related to transmission in the course of therapy."
4852,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."
4322,0.001,1.0000,"At present, there is no case report of HHV8- primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) with t(9;14)(p13;q32) involving both PAX-5 and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, which is a rare translocation in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in an HIV- patient. We examined an HIV-seronegative 63-year-old Japanese man with hepatitis C virus-associated liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma manifesting peritoneal lymphomatous effusion without tumor mass at any body site. The lymphoma cells were examined twice by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, three-color flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular analyses. The nuclear morphology of lymphoma cells was similar to that of large noncleaved cells, although the lymphoma cell size was a little smaller that of the usual large-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotyping of lymphoma cells in the ascitic fluid revealed a mature peripheral B-cell phenotype (CD5- CD10- CD19+ CD20+ CD22+ Ig G+ lambda+). Cytogenetics showed a clonal population: 45,X,-Y, der(2) t(2;6)(q31;p21.3), t(4;8)(q21;q11.2), der(6) t(2;6)(q31;p21.3) add(6)(q15), t(9;14)(p13;q32.3) [10]/47, idem, +der(6) t(2;6), +16[10]. Southern blot analysis revealed rearranged fragments with a probe for immunoglobulin heavy chain, some of which were a size similar to those with a PAX-5 gene probe. Polymorphism, not rearrangement, of the c-MYC gene, was also found. HHV8 and the Epstein-Barr virus were not detected by polymerase chain reaction. This case is the first report of an HHV8- PEL with t(9;14) involving a PAX-5 gene rearrangement in an HIV-seronegative patient. This primary effusion lymphoma manifested spontaneous regression without any therapy. These findings suggest that there may be an additional subcategory of primary effusion lymphoma that is not associated with HHV8 nor c-MYC(R) but is pathogenetically associated with the PAX-5 gene or hepatitis C virus."
5811,0.001,1.0000,"HIV accelerates progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease. There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."
9965,0.001,1.0000,"HCV and HIV co-infection is associated with accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality among HIV-infected patients. New insights have revealed multiple mechanisms by which HCV and HIV lead to accelerated disease progression, specifically that HIV infection increases HCV replication, augments HCV-induced hepatic inflammation, increases hepatocyte apoptosis, increases microbial translocation from the gut and leads to an impairment of HCV-specific immune responses. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy and treatment of HCV have independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients. However, rates of sustained virologic response with PEG-IFN and ribavirin have been significantly inferior among co-infected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, and treatment uptake has remained low given the limited efficacy and tolerability of current HCV regimens. With multiple direct-acting antiviral agents in development to treat HCV, a unique opportunity exists to redefine the treatment paradigm for co-infected patients, which incorporates data on fibrosis stage as well as potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy.

9521,0.001,1.0000,"Although the pathogenetic significance of hepatitis B virus x protein (HBxAg) in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma has already been studied, the comparative analyses of both the actual serum HBxAg levels and antibody production against various HBx epitopes have been examined to lesser extent. We have simultaneously investigated the relationship between antibody production (IgG and IgM) against the HBxAg fragments and HBxAg level in the sera of patients with acute (14) or chronic hepatitis (80) and symptomless carriers (12). A recently developed sandwich-type ELISA was used for the quantitative measurements of HBxAg. Overlapping recombinant and synthetic antigens were used to map the fine epitope specificities of circulating anti-HBx antibodies. In acute hepatitis, we have found high and homogenous correlation in the IgM type immune responses against all the examined HBxAg regions. Moreover, strong correlation has been observed between IgG type immune responses to a characteristic C-terminal region (C1: 79-117) and the longest fragment (X: 10-143). Moderate correlation has been found between HBxAg concentration and the IgG type anti-HBx antibody levels against C-terminus of HBxAg in patients with chronic hepatitis. In the case of symptomless carriers, there were also demonstrable associations in the immune responses against the C-terminal sequences; however, significant correlations were found for antibody production against the N-terminal region as well. The examinations show that the C-terminal sequence, responsible for transactivation, promotes an efficient IgG antibody response in all three groups of patients, whereas the negative regulator N-terminal part of the HBxAg molecule for the most part does not trigger antibody production. This suggests that the immune responses against various - biologically active - epitopes of the HBxAg may have a different role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis and may be used as prognostic markers in human HBV infections."

HIV infects multiple cells in the liver and might potentially alter the life cycle of HBV, although evidence to date is limited. Unique mutations in HBV have been defined in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals and might directly alter pathogenesis. In addition, an impaired HBV-specific T-cell immune response is likely to be important. The roles of microbial translocation, immune activation and increased hepatic stellate cell activation will be important areas for future study."
6181,0.001,1.0000,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
7086,0.001,1.0000,"Hodgkin's lymphoma is the most common non-AIDS-defining tumor diagnosed in HIV-infected patients. Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) led to a decreased incidence of several malignancies among HIV-infected patients, the incidence of HIV-associated Hodgkin's lymphoma (HIV-HL) has been persistent in recent years. Its unusually aggressive tumor behavior includes a higher frequency of unfavorable histologic subtypes, high stage and extranodal involvement by the time of presentation and poor therapeutic outcome, in comparison with Hodgkin's lymphoma outside the HIV setting. Treatment of HIV-HL is challenging considering the underlying immunodeficiency caused by HIV itself and may increase the risk of opportunistic infections by inducing further immunosuppression. To address this delicate vulnerability of the HIV-infected host, tailored regimens, which are less aggressive than standard regimens for HIV-negative hosts, have been applied to achieve tumor control. The introduction of HAART has opened a new perspective in the treatment of HIV-associated malignancies. The improved control of HIV infection and the subsequently improved survival rates of HIV-infected patients has changed the goal from tumor control to cure and new treatment approaches with more potent regimens need to be evaluated to improve survival and quality of life in HIV-HL."

A retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU was undertaken. Outcomes in the pre-HAART era (1990-June 1996), early- (July 1996-2002), and recent-HAART (2003-2008) periods and total HAART era (July 1996-2008) were analysed and compared with those reported of the general population. A total of 127 ICU admissions were included. The 1-year mortality decreased from 71% in the pre-HAART era to 50% in the recent-HAART period (p = 0.06). The 5-year mortality decreased from 87% in the pre-HAART era to 59% in the early-HAART period (p = 0.005). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality in the HAART era were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.27]), APACHE II score > 20 (6.04 [1.25-29.22]) and mechanical ventilation (40.01 [3.01-532.65]). The 5-year survival after hospitalisation was 80% and in the range of the reported survival of non-HIV-infected patients (83.7%). Predictors of 1-year mortality for HIV patients admitted to the ICU in the HAART era were all non-HIV-related. Short- and long-term outcome has improved since the introduction of HAART and is comparable to the outcome data in non-HIV-infected ICU patients."

A retrospective study was carried out using data from the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) and the State Meteorological Agency (AEMET) of Spain. The primary outcome variable was hospital admissions with PTB diagnosis. The environmental risk factors evaluated were season, temperature, humidity, NO2, SO2, O3, PM10, and CO. Overall, HIV-infected patients had a lower frequency of PTB-related hospital admissions in summer (22.8%) and autumn (22.4%), but higher values in winter (26.6%) and spring (28.2%). Using a Bayesian temporal model, PTB-related hospital admissions were less frequent in summer-autumn and more abundant in winter-spring during the first years of follow-up. During the later years of follow-up, the seasonal trends continued resulting in the lowest values in autumn and the highest in spring. When considering short-term exposure to environmental risk factors, lower temperatures at 1 week (odds ratio (OR) = 1.03; p = 0.008), 1.5 weeks (OR = 1.03; p<0.001), 2 weeks (OR = 1.04; p<0.001), and 3 weeks (OR = 1.03; p<0.001) prior to PTB admission. In addition, higher concentration of NO2 at the time of admission were significantly associated with higher likelihoods of PTB-related hospital admission in HIV-infected patients when 1.5 weeks (OR = 1.1; p = 0.044) and 2 weeks (OR = 1.21; p<0.001) were used as controls. Finally, higher concentration of SO2 at 1.5 weeks prior to PTB admission was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of PTB-related hospital admissions (OR = 0.92; p = 0.029). In conclusion, our data suggest an apparent seasonal variation in hospital admissions of HIV-infected patients with a PTB diagnosis (summer/autumn vs. winter/spring), as well as a link to short-term exposure to environmental risk factors, such as temperature and ambient NO2 and SO2."
9772,0.001,1.0000,"The present study aims at evaluating the association between seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five genes involved on antiretroviral pharmacokinetic pathways and virological failure in first line highly active antiretroviral therapy. Seven candidate polymorphisms (rs3842 and rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs212091 and rs3743527 in ABCC1, rs3745274 in CYP2B6, rs628031 in SLC22A1 and rs1517618 in SLCO3A1) were evaluated if they were associated with virological failure through logistic regression analysis. The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients. "
8821,0.001,1.0000,"Estimates of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence varies among different studies depending on the prevalence of HBV infection in the study population and on the sensitivity of the assay used to detect HBV DNA. We investigated the prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Brazilian referral center. Frozen liver samples from 68 adults were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for HBV DNA. The specificity of the amplified HBV sequences was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The patient population comprised 49 (72.1%) males and 19 (27.9%) females with a median age of 53 years (range=18-67 years). Occult HBV infection was diagnosed in three (4.4%) patients. The etiologies of the underlying chronic liver disease in these cases were alcohol abuse, HBV infection, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two of the patients with cryptic HBV infection also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Markers of previous HBV infection were available in two patients with occult HBV infection and were negative in both. In conclusion, using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction assay to detect HBV DNA in frozen liver tissue, we found a low prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant, probably due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in our population.

9681,0.001,1.0000,"With the rapid progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the observed patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis has changed, allowing herpesvirus (HV) infection to be controlled. HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."
3614,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with once-daily dosing of tenofovir and tenofovir-emtricitabine was shown to be effective for preventing HIV-1 infection in individuals who had HIV-1-seropositive partners (the Partners PrEP Study). We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."
144,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 uses the coreceptors CCR5 and/or CXCR4 for cell entry. Monotropic CCR5-using variants are found early in the infection while CXCR4-using variants may appear after progression to AIDS. CXCR4 use may consist of both monotropic and dualtropic viruses. The viral phenotype is important in evaluating the response to CCR5 inhibitors, a new class of antiviral drugs. The coreceptor use of HIV-1 was investigated using population sequencing in 24 patients from Botswana, carrying HIV-1 subtype C and failing antiretroviral treatment, while 26 treatment-naive patients acted as controls. Single genome sequencing was used to discern minor HIV-1 populations in the treatment-experienced group. The Geno2Pheno method was employed to predict the coreceptor use phenotype from HIV-1 env gp120 V3 DNA sequences. The glycan-charge model adjusted for subtype C was also used for phenotype prediction. The viral phenotype of population sequences was predicted using Geno2Pheno in 24/24 treatment-experienced patients, of whom eight (33%) were predicted to harbor CXCR4-using strains as compared to 2/26 in the treatment-naive group (p=0.03). Single genome sequencing generated 4-23 clones/patient in the treatment-experienced group. Altogether, 90/295 (31%) putative CXCR4-using clones were identified. In 10/24 (42%) treated patients at least one clone was predicted to be CXCR4-using, further increasing the amount of identified treatment-experienced patients with CXCR4 use. Although subtype C is usually associated with comparatively little CXCR4 use, the frequency of CXCR4 use in treatment-experienced patients with subtype C can be higher, which may have implications for the administration of CCR5 inhibitors in this patient group."
8719,0.001,1.0000,"Recent evidence suggests an association between cervical condyloma, dysplasia and HIV infection. However, the course of cervical cancer in immunodeficient patients has not yet been thoroughly researched. Cervical cancer presently amounts to 1% of the causes of death in AIDS patients. This percentage is bound to increase not only because an improved life expectancy has been obtained, but mainly because the virus is widely spreading among the female population. A 28 year-old AIDS patient, parity 1/0/1/1, underwent gynecological examination and colposcopy following an episode of vaginal bleeding. Biopsy revealed an invasive cervical carcinoma. The last gynecologic investigation, which included a Pap smear and colposcopy, was performed 14 months earlier and resulted negative. Cytologic reexamination of the specimen confirmed the previous Pap smear result. Proctoscopy and cystoscopy showed no mucose involvement. Urography was negative. The cat scan indicated minor spleen and liver enlargement but no signs of malignant abdominal spread were found. The neoplasia was classified as a stage IIB cervical carcinoma (according to the FIGO classification) due to the spread to the left cardinal ligament. In spite of radiation therapy, the disease rapidly progressed leading to a monolateral ureteral involvement which created a juxtavescical stenosis. The patient died three months later. Necroscopic examination revealed lung metastasis. Such a rapidly progressive form of cervical cancer could be related to the acquired immunodeficiency condition. Recurrent cytological and colposcopic examinations are to be considered mandatory in HIV patients."
5113,0.001,1.0000,"This study explores whether MHC genes affect manifestations of opportunistic infections in HIV patients not treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and immunopathologic responses to pre-existing infections in patients who achieved immune reconstitution following HAART (i.e., ""immune restoration diseases"" or IRD). HLA-B27 and B17 were relatively rare in all HIV patients, but no HLA-B alleles significantly affected cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients who had not received HAART. However coexpression of alleles previously defined as the 44.1 ancestral haplotype (HLA-A2, -B44, and -DR4) was more common in the MAC and CMV patients. After HAART, HLA-B44 and (HLA-A2, -B44, -DR4) were found in 66% and 33%, respectively, of patients who experienced an IRD manifested as CMV retinitis and/or encephalomyelitis. This was confirmed by examination of microsatellite alleles, where the C1_2_5 locus in the class I region was most concordant with the 44.1 haplotype in the patients. HLA-B44 was not associated with IRD initiated by Mycobacterium sp, cutaneous VZV or HSV, or HCV infections, suggesting distinct pathologic mechanisms are responsible. CMV retinitis/encephalomyelitis IRD patients had marginally lower pretreatment CD4 T-cell counts, but indices of immune reconstitution were similar in all groups and independent of HLA-B44."
3803,0.001,1.0000,"Our objective was to map serial patterns of Western blot reactivity over time of a cohort of initially ELISA-negative, Western blot-indeterminate individuals from a high-risk group and to determine if these individuals were at increased risk of harboring occult HIV-1 infection. A 2-year prospective study used serial ELISA, two types of Western blot, immunologic profiles, HIV-1 culture, and analysis by polymerase chain reaction. Subjects were 20 ELISA-negative, Western blot indeterminate homosexual volunteers and 20 matched seronegative controls. Results showed that 19 of 20 study subjects completed a mean of 17.0 months of clinical and laboratory follow-up. Reactivities with p24 and/or with p55 were the two most commonly observed Western blot patterns, occurring in 70% of individuals. Specific Western blot reactivity was dependent upon the particular immunoblot preparation being used and varied considerably on a longitudinal basis. No individual pattern appeared predictive of an increased likelihood of subsequent seroconversion to HIV-1 relative to controls. By all other criteria including polymerase chain reaction analysis, samples from 17 of 19 individuals remained negative for HIV-1 at each time point. Two individuals evolved from an indeterminate to a positive Western blot and, simultaneously, from a negative to a positive polymerase chain reaction analysis, during follow-up. Our conclusions were as follows. ELISA-negative, Western blot-indeterminate individuals from a high-risk group show marked variability in immunoblot findings over time, and these patterns do not appear predictive of an increased likelihood of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4149,0.001,1.0000,"We studied 13 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and a chronic pruritic folliculitis that was unresponsive to systemic treatment with bactericidal anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. The skin eruption was characterized by multiple urticarial follicular papules scattered on the trunk (100%), the head and neck (85%), and the proximal aspect of the extremities (62%). Absolute peripheral eosinophil counts were increased in six of 13 patients; a relative peripheral eosinophilia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Serum IgE levels were elevated in all seven patients tested (range, 88 to 9050 IU). Histopathologic features included a folliculitis with eosinophils. Pathogenic bacteria were not consistently found by routine bacterial skin cultures, cultures of skin biopsy specimens, or histopathologic evaluation. CD4 counts were decreased in all of the 12 patients tested (less than 300 cells per cubic millimeter) and were below 250 cells per cubic millimeter in 10 patients. A clinical response was noted to astemizole, to ultraviolet light in the B range, and to topical clobetasol propionate. These observations demonstrate that HIV-associated eosinophilic folliculitis is a unique HIV-related cutaneous disorder that is characterized by a culture-negative, chronic, pruritic folliculitis and a characteristic histopathologic picture. Of special importance, because it is associated with CD4 counts of less than 250 to 300 cells per cubic millimeter, eosinophilic folliculitis appears to be an important clinical marker of HIV infection and, particularly, of patients at increased risk of developing opportunistic infections. We suggest that the term eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (Ofuji's disease), previously used to describe this dermatosis in HIV-infected patients, should be discarded."
140,0.001,1.0000,"A population-based survey was carried out in the Kagera region of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1987 to determine the magnitude of HIV-1 infection and to study associated risk factors. The region was divided into one urban and three rural zones. A multistage cluster sampling technique was adopted. Antibodies to HIV-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot analysis. A total of 2,475 adults (aged 15-54 years) and 1,961 children (aged 0-14 years) was studied. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among adults was 9.6%, with a higher prevalence in the urban zone (24.2%) than in the three rural zones (10.0, 4.5 and 0.4%, respectively). The corresponding figures for children were 1.3% overall: 3.9% in the urban area and for the rural areas 1.2, 0.8 and 0.0%, respectively. The age-specific seroprevalence for adults was highest in the age group 25-34 years. The age-standardized sex-specific prevalence was higher among women than men in the urban zone, while it was the same in the rural zones. Change of sexual partners among adults was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 seropositivity. Travelling outside the region but within the country was also found to be associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection but only in the rural population."
20,0.001,1.0000,"Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy in controlling viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, commonly referred to as neuroAIDS, remain a frequent and poorly understood complication. Infection of CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted rhesus macaques with the SIVmac251 viral swarm is a well-established rapid disease model of neuroAIDS that has provided critical insight into HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder onset and progression. However, no studies so far have characterized in depth the relationship between intra-host viral evolution and pathogenesis in this model. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env gp120 sequences were obtained from six infected animals. Sequences were sampled longitudinally from several lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, including individual lobes within the brain at necropsy, for four macaques; two animals were sacrificed at 21 days post-infection (p.i.) to evaluate early viral seeding of the brain. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the sequence data were used to ascertain viral population dynamics and gene flow between peripheral and brain tissues, respectively. A steady increase in viral effective population size, with a peak occurring at ~50-80 days p.i., was observed across all longitudinally monitored macaques. Phylogeographic analysis indicated continual viral seeding of the brain from several peripheral tissues throughout infection, with the last migration event before terminal illness occurring in all macaques from cells within the bone marrow. The results strongly supported the role of infected bone marrow cells in HIV/SIV neuropathogenesis. In addition, our work demonstrated the applicability of Bayesian phylogeography to intra-host studies in order to assess the interplay between viral evolution and pathogenesis. "

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "
9733,0.001,1.0000,"Access to antiretrovirals has increased the life expectancy of patients living with HIV. However, HIV-viral hepatitis coinfections in countries endemic for these infections make management more difficult. To determine the extent of these coinfections in Gabon, we investigated markers of hepatitis B, C, and E viruses in 762 adults infected with HIV-1 by ELISA. We used real-time PCR to quantify plasma HBV DNA (HBV VL) and amplified HCV and HEV RNA by nested RT-PCR and PCR.The seroprevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection was 9.3 %. Among patients with isolated HBcAc profiles, the prevalence of occult hepatitis B infection was 26.7 %, for a real prevalence (detectable CV-HBV) of 17.3 % of the total population. HCV seroprevalence was 8.8 %. Of the 67 HIV-positive patients, 76.1 % had replicative profiles (detectable HCV RNA), that is, 6.7 % of the total population. For hepatitis E, seroprevalence was 3.5 %. No case of chronic HEV infection was found. In conclusion, this study highlights a high rate of HIV-Hepatitis B, C and E coinfections in Gabon. In addition, we show the interest of looking for chronic infections (replicative profiles) in HIV-infected patients in Gabon. The establishment of technical platforms for this type of research, accessible to middle-income countries, is necessary."
4287,0.001,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may have hepatitis flares when lamivudine therapy is discontinued or when resistance of HBV to lamivudine emerges. This retrospective, descriptive study conducted in three tertiary care medical centers describes patients coinfected with HIV type 1 and HBV who presented with a spectrum of clinical and subclinical hepatitic responses to lamivudine withdrawal or resistance. One patient had fulminant hepatic failure and a second patient had subclinical hepatitis when lamivudine therapy was discontinued and a more efficacious antiretroviral regimen was substituted. Three patients had flares of hepatitis after 13 to 18 months of lamivudine therapy. Lamivudine withdrawal or emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants in patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may result in severe hepatitis. Clinicians caring for patients with coinfection with HIV and HBV should be aware of the possibility that a hepatitis B flare may occur in previously asymptomatic carrier patients."
8628,0.001,1.0000,"Many clinicians who care for patients with HIV infection are dissatisfied with the existing recommendations on antiretroviral therapy. Current practice focuses on the early suppression of viremia, yet the outcome of that approach may not be in the best interest of individual patients or populations. The major goal of HIV therapy is to maintain the long-term health of the patient while avoiding drug-related toxicity and preserving viable future treatment options. Recent studies have challenged the principles on which recommendations for early, aggressive treatment were based. Key studies that lead to licensure of antiretroviral medications usually involve short-term results in treatment-naive patients; it is difficult to apply these results to long-term management of therapy-experienced patients. Early, aggressive therapy often prematurely exposes patients to risks for medication-related side effects and resistance. A more cautious, patient-focused, long-term approach to therapy would help foster studies of alternate strategies, such as delayed initiation of therapy, protease-sparing therapy, class-sparing therapy, planned drug interruptions, switches in therapy, and immune-based therapy. It is time for clinicians to rethink their approach to the treatment of HIV infection."
8416,0.001,1.0000,Sera from 65 patients with primary liver carcinoma (PLC) and 69 sex- and age-matched controls were examined for Hepatitis B virus markers. Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.
8740,0.001,1.0000,"Clinical decision-making regarding operative procedures will be influenced when the patient is known to be anti-HIV, so his or her status should be discussed with the patient and clinician responsible for other aspects of his or her care. Here, we reviewed serology screening for anti-HIV in a 1-year period at the PreAdmission Clinic of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the largest Thai Red Cross Society hospital. A total of 463 patients, 215 males and 248 females, were investigated, and four cases (all males) were determined to have anti-HIV seropositivity. The infection rate was 0.86%, similar to that of previous surveys of the general population. According to our study, 75% of the HIV-seropositive patients did not know their HIV status before our screening, and most of the infected cases (50%) underwent sex change surgery. The patients who underwent elective surgery in our clinic were usually anti-HIV seronegative. The risk group of our patients seems to be the sexual dysphorian patients who underwent sex change surgery. Additional screening tests for other infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus is recommended. However, in a setting where HIV infection is common, such as in Thailand, the physician should practice universal precautions since any serological test poses dangers during diagnosis."
6195,0.001,1.0000,"To determine behavioural risk factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity among 1104 youth aged 15-24 years we conducted a cross-sectional survey in Moshi rural district in northern Tanzania. Information was obtained about sociodemographic characteristics as well as sexual and reproductive health behaviour. Anonymous blood samples were taken for HIV testing. Positive HIV antibodies were determined and confirmed by two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Of 1104 youth interviewed, 91% (1003) consented for blood specimen taking. Seven out of ten youth volunteered to have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime; 60% reported to consume alcohol and 50% of the sexually experienced females reported to have received a gift for their sexual encounter. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 7.5% (75/1003); females compared to males were twice as likely to be HIV positive, 9.7% and 5% respectively. Behavioural risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were different in male compared to female youth. Among male subjects, cigarette smoking, ever use of marijuana and having a past history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were significant risk factors associated with increased risk of HIV seropositivity. On the other hand, in females, those with a past or current history of STDs, those who volunteered that they practiced oral sex and subjects with four or more lifetime sexual partners were more likely to be HIV positive than subjects without a history of an STD, those with single sexual partner or had never practiced oral sex. A four fold increased risk of HIV seropositivity was also observed among female subjects with a history of blood transfusion in the previous 10 years compared to having received none, the Odds ratio was 4.1 (95% CI = 1.5, 11.1). The profile of risk behaviour associated with HIV seropositivity calls for an urgent need to target health information and education interventions to bring about a change in behaviour among the youth and hopefully help to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV infection."
3681,0.001,1.0000,"We studied hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission among 7416 Thai children from 148 schools in Kamphaeng Phet province, a rural part of northern Thailand. Their age ranged from 2 to 16 years (median 9 years). Between May 1991 and June 1992, 61 of 2593 (2.4%) in the cohort of susceptible children acquired anti-HBc immunoglobulin. Forty-seven of the 148 schools had children who acquired anti-HBc. School seroconversion rates to anti-HBc varied from 0% to 23%. There was no correlation between percent of carriers in schools and percent of anti-HBc acquisition. Of the 61 children who acquired anti-HBc, eight (13%) became HBsAg carriers but only two were symptomatic, for a clinical to subclinical infection ration of 1 : 30. One of the two symptomatic children became an HBsAg carrier. Three (38%) of the eight who were persistently antigenemic developed antibody to hepatitis B virus e antigen. Males were 2.5 times (95% CI 1.4-4.3) more likely to acquire anti-HBc than females. Risk factors for acquisition of HBc in Thailand over a 9-month period were examined in a subset of 2412 susceptible children and later in a case-control study of 22 children who acquired anti-HBc and 59 age and sex-matched controls. Risks for acquiring anti-HBc were male gender and a history of bleeding gums. In comparing this study to an earlier pilot study among 9848 children from the same area in Thailand, the yearly antibody acquisition rate to anti-HBc among Thai children dropped from 5.7% in 1989 to 2.4% in 1992. A random sample of children in the pilot study showed that 16% were HBsAg positive and 27% had anti-HBc at the beginning of the study. 34% had markers for either anti-HBc or HBsAg. 12% were repeatedly positive for HBsAg a year later."
9877,0.001,1.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO), a recently discovered free radical, is overproduced in liver cirrhosis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) might increase NO levels via increased inducible NO synthase (iNOS). This work was carried out to study the effect of HCV-induced liver cirrhosis on NO levels among Egyptian patients. The study included 46 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 30 healthy individuals of matched age and sex. NO levels determined as the stable endproduct nitrate, showed a statistically significant increase among patients compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, NO levels increased proportionally with the severity of liver cirrhosis as assessed by Child's classification (P < 0.05). Moreover, schistosomial infection enhanced NO levels in cirrhotic patients with HCV infection compared to non-bilharzial patients (P < 0.001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and branched DNA assays were used for detection of HCV RNA positivity, and measurement of the virus load, respectively. Both showed a positive correlation with the NO levels (P < 0.001). At a nitrate cutoff value of 70 micromol/L, the sensitivity and specificity were 83.0% and 73.0%, respectively. Chi square analysis showed a significant correlation between ALT levels and both HCV RNA positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (P < 0.02), and virus load (P<0.05). Interestingly enough, there was a significant positive correlation between HCV RNA and schistosomal antibody titer as measured by hemaglutination inhibition assay (HAI) (P < 0.05). The data presented in this report indicated an association between NO levels and the development and progression of liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, the findings obtained from this study demonstrated that schistomiasis is an important risk factor involved in enhancement of NO levels and virus replication. The latter may aggravate liver cell injury and hence the development of cirrhosis."
878,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major issue among dialysis patients. It is associated with a high risk of hepatic complication. The liver disease runs a unique clinical course in dialysis patients, as it can progress with modest hepatic inflammation and prominent fibrosis. The conventional cut-off level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for commencing antiviral therapy may prove too high and inappropriate for dialysis patients, and liver biopsy appears to be the only definitive means to establish the activity of liver disease in dialysis patients. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a serum ALT level that is persistently greater than 30 IU/L, or 0.75-fold the upper limit of the normal level, and/or other clinical and laboratory findings that suggest active liver disease. For antiviral treatment, preliminary reports have shown that lamivudine is effective and well tolerated in dialysis patients. However, the long-term efficacy of lamivudine and its optimal effective dose in dialysis patients remain unknown. The prevention of nosocomial transmission among dialysis patients is also important. Universal precaution measures should be strictly observed and the segregation of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hemodialysis patients should be considered. For HBV non-immune patients, the importance of HBV vaccination should not be overemphasized. Until a new generation of highly immunogenic vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease becomes available, early vaccination before the development of end-stage renal failure remains the best way to secure immunological protection against HBV infection in dialysis patients."

Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively.

Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."
2031,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."
6552,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1-infected patients are surviving longer and by 2015 half will be older than 50 years of age. Frailty is a syndrome associated with advanced age but occurs in HIV-1-infected patients at younger ages. One hundred outpatient HIV-1-infected persons were prospectively tested for clinical markers of frailty: shrinking weight, slowness in walking, decrease in grip strength, low activity, and exhaustion. Age, length of infection with HIV, CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, and comorbidities were compared. CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3) were associated with 9-fold increased odds of frailty relative to patients with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm(3) (odds ratio [OR] 9.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-44). Seven frail patients were measured 6 months later: 2 died refusing therapy, 4 were no longer frail, and 1 patient remained frail. We conclude that frailty is common in HIV outpatients and is associated with low CD4 counts. However, our data suggest that frailty is transient, especially in younger patients who may revert to their prefrail state unlike uninfected elderly individuals in whom a stepwise decline in function occurs."
8109,0.001,1.0000,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) blunt uncontrolled immune responses. In advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the total number of Tregs is decreased, but the proportion of T cells with a regulatory phenotype is highly variable. We studied CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells from patients successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). The proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) cells transiently increased and then decreased from a median of 13% at baseline to 5.1% at 48 weeks, similar to values in normal subjects. These data suggest that with effective therapy, the regulatory cell numbers normalize, and that the inflammatory signals driving their production may also abate."
5664,0.001,1.0000,"Three human T cell clones (TCC) specific for purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were incubated in the presence of polybrene and phytohemagglutinin with irradiated mononuclear cells from one individual exhibiting seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and high levels of circulating p24 antigen. After three weeks, TCC showed HIV integration in their DNA, as shown by polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern blot technique. All the three HIV-infected TCC maintained their ability to recognize the specific antigen, even if their proliferative ability was reduced. The ability of the HIV-infected TCC to produce IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-gamma in response to phorbol myristate acetate plus anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was decreased, whereas their ability to produce TNF-alpha was unaffected or even enhanced. Two out of the three HIV-infected TCC showed the ability to provide helper function for polyclonal immunoglobulin production when cocultured with autologous B cells in the absence of any stimulant. These data suggest that in vitro infection of normal human TCC may provide a useful model for the study of immunological alterations induced by HIV."
6594,0.001,1.0000,"Current therapy for chronic hepatitis B is suboptimal as a result of limited durable response rates, cumulative viral resistance, and/or poor tolerability. Telbivudine has potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in the woodchuck model and has a promising preclinical safety profile. In this first clinical study of telbivudine, safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in 43 adults with hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B. This placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial investigated 6 telbivudine daily dosing levels (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/d); treatment was given for 4 weeks, with 12 weeks' follow-up. Serum HBV DNA levels were monitored via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results indicate that telbivudine was well tolerated at all dosing levels, with no dose-related or treatment-related clinical or laboratory adverse events. telbivudine plasma pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional within the studied dose range. Marked dose-related antiviral activity was evident, with a maximum at telbivudine doses of 400 mg/d or more. In the 800 mg/d cohort, the mean HBV DNA reduction was 3.75 log10 copies/mL at week 4, comprising a 99.98% reduction in serum viral load. Correspondingly, posttreatment return of viral load was slowest in the high-dose groups. Viral dynamic analyses suggested a high degree of efficiency of inhibition of HBV replication by telbivudine and helped refine selection of the optimal dose. In conclusion, these results support expanded clinical studies of this new agent for the treatment of hepatitis B."
7486,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the reliability of information reported by patients with AIDS or HIV infection, 123 homosexual men were recruited in Victoria, Australia, in 1992-1993 and interviewed to collect data retrospectively and prospectively on HIV-related illness and treatment. These data were compared with information in medical and pharmacy records. There was no evidence of bias in the patient report of date of diagnosis of HIV infection or date or result of most recent CD4 count, although there was considerable imprecision. Past and current prescription of AZT were recalled accurately by patients compared with medical records (kappa = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively), but previous HIV-related illnesses and enrollment in clinical studies or trials were generally recalled poorly (kappa < 0.4 in some cases). Data collected prospectively on prescription of drugs and use of health care services were reasonably accurately reported by patients. This analysis supports the need for routine assessment of the validity of patient-reported exposure and outcome data in epidemiological studies in order to minimize the possible biases that can result from inaccurate information."
4762,0.001,1.0000,"Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. African Americans (AAs) have the highest incidence of CRC of any American ethnic group. Survival from CRC in AAs is lower than in Caucasians, and the mean age of CRC development in AAs is younger. The AA community also has a high rate of HIV infection, accounting for 50.3% of all cases despite making up only 13.6% of the population. This retrospective cohort study identified 17 AA HIV patients with CRC. The patients were matched with 42 HIV-negative CRC patients (controls), based on age, sex, and TNM stage. Data were obtained from 3 hospitals in New Jersey: St. Michael's Medical Center, Trinitas Medical Center and St. Joseph's Medical Center. The age, sex, HIV status, tumor site, stage, drug usage, Hepatitis C status, and survival outcome of subjects and controls were compared. Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) specific to AAs were also compared. The mean age of CRC diagnosis was younger, 50.7 years (median: 52 years, range: 35-71 years), versus 59.42 years (median: 66 years) (P < 0.0001) in the SEER AA population. Of the patients, 29.4% were diagnosed with CRC at less than 45 years of age, versus only 6.35% of the SEER AA population (P < 0.0002). The male-to-female ratio was 11:6. Seven individuals used IV drugs, and 7 had hepatitis C. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 510.81 cells/mm(3) (median 419). At the time of CRC diagnosis, the average duration of HIV infection was 7.6 years (range 0-22.4 years).Of patients, 87.5% had left-sided CRC, versus 57.55% of the SEER population (P < 0.024). Of the patients, 52.94% had stage III-IV, at diagnosis, versus 43.84% in SEER. There was no statistically significant survival difference between the cases and controls. In our cohort of HIV-infected AA's with CRC, the staging and outcome of CRC did not appear to be affected by the degree of immunosuppression. HIV-infected AA with CRC presented with a higher percentage of left-sided CRC than AA's without HIV. Additionally, AAs with HIV tended to be younger at the time of CRC diagnosis. Our findings suggest that screening for CRC should be offered to HIV-infected AAs before the age of 45, and that sigmoidoscopy with fecal occult blood testing might be an acceptable screening modality. However, the exact age of initiation, optimal frequency, and preferred method of screening (colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy) in this population requires further study."

7394,0.001,1.0000,"In the USA and West Europe, nearly 80% of HIV-1-infected adults, experiencing virologic failure, harbored virus strain resistant to at least one antiretroviral drug. Limited data are available on antiretroviral drug resistance in pediatric HIV infection. The aims of this study were to analyze prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance and to identify risk factors associated with resistance in this population. Prevalence of genotypic resistance was estimated retrospectively in treated children who experienced virologic failure (with HIV-1-RNA > 500 copies/ml) followed in Necker hospital between 2001 and 2003. Among 119 children with resistance testing, prevalence of resistance to any drug was 82.4%. Resistance ranged from 76.5% to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), to 48.7% to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 42.9% to protease inhibitor (PI). Resistance to at least one drug of two classes and three classes (triple resistance) was 31.9 and 26.9%, respectively. Resistance was not associated with geographic origin, HIV-1 subtype, and CDC status. In multivariate analysis, resistance to any drug remained associated independently with current low viral load and high lifetime number of past PI. Triple resistance was independently associated with the high lifetime number of past PI and with gender, particularly among children aged 11 years old or more with a prevalence seven times higher in boys than in girls. In conclusion, antiretroviral resistance is common among treated HIV-1-infected children and prevalence was similar with those observed in adult population in the same year period. However, adolescent boys seem to be at greater risk."
8752,0.001,1.0000,"Crohn's disease is believed to have an immunologic basis. The importance of the CD4 cell in particular has been supported by several reports of patients whose symptoms of Crohn's disease resolved after a decline in CD4 count associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A patient with known Crohn's disease, however, who was later infected with HIV, was reported to continue to have symptomatic Crohn's disease despite an eventual decrease in CD4 count to 84/mm3. We report the new onset of Crohn's disease in an HIV-infected patient with a CD4 count of 100/mm3. This report is the first to document the new onset of Crohn's disease in a patient with HIV and a CD4 count in the range commonly associated with various opportunistic infections and neoplasms. In addition, it is the first to confirm the recent finding that Crohn's disease may be active despite the profound immune deficiency associated with advanced HIV infection. Thus this report further challenges the significance of the CD4 cell in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease."
9917,0.001,1.0000,"We attempted to determine whether HIV-1 developed resistance to (--)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine ((--)-3TC or 3TC, lamivudine) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during therapy with 3TC. Genotypic analysis of HIV-1 strains isolated from 6 patients receiving 3TC revealed that as early as 2 months of therapy, HIV-1 developed a Met to Val amino acid substitution at codon 184 (Met184-->Val) in the reverse transcriptase-coding region of the pol gene. A detailed study of a series of HIV-1 strains isolated from a patient demonstrated that Met at codon 184 was first substituted with Ile by 2 weeks of 3TC therapy, followed by the substitution with Val by 8 weeks. All HIV-1 strains with the Met184-->Val substitution were profoundly less susceptible to 3TC (1800- to 5500-fold decreased sensitivity) as compared to pretherapy virus strains. These strains were also moderately less sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (4.5- to 9-fold), but more sensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (2- to 14-fold). A decrease in viremia levels and an increase in CD4 counts were observed early in therapy; however, these changes were only transient. Our data suggest that reversal of such beneficial changes is associated with the Met184-->Val substitution of the pol gene of HIV-1. The data also suggest that 3TC, as a single agent, may induce virologic and immunologic improvement in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, but only transiently."
3097,0.001,1.0000,"We have studied 18 participants in phase I/II clinical trials of recombinant gp120 (rgp120) subunit vaccines (MN and SF-2) who became infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) during the course of the trials. Of the 18 individuals, 2 had received a placebo vaccine, 9 had been immunized with MN rgp120, and seven had been immunized with SF-2 rgp120. Thirteen of the 18 infected vaccinees had received three or four immunizations prior to becoming infected. Of these, two were placebo recipients, six had received MN rgp120, and five had received SF-2 rgp120. Only 1 of the 11 rgp120 recipients who had multiple immunizations failed to develop a strong immunoglobulin G antibody response to the immunogen. However, the antibody response to rgp120 was transient, typically having a half-life of 40 to 60 days. No significant neutralizing activity against the infecting strain was detected in any of the infected individuals at any time prior to infection. Antibody titers in subjects infected despite vaccination and in noninfected subjects were not significantly different. Envelope-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses measured after infection were infrequent and weak in the nine vaccinees who were tested. HIV-1 was isolated successfully from all 18 individuals. Sixteen of these strains had a non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) phenotype, while two had a syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. NSI strains used the CCR5 coreceptor to enter CD4+ cells, while an SI strain from one of the vaccinees also used CXCR4. Viruses isolated from the blood of rgp120 vaccinees were indistinguishable from viruses isolated from control individuals in terms of their inherent sensitivity to neutralization by specific monoclonal antibodies and their replication rates in vitro. Furthermore, genetic sequencing of the env genes of strains infecting the vaccinees did not reveal any features that clearly distinguished these viruses from contemporary clade B viruses circulating in the United States. Thus, despite rigorous genetic analyses, using various breakdowns of the data sets, we could find no evidence that rgp120 vaccination exerted selection pressure on the infecting HIV-1 strains. The viral burdens in the infected rgp120 vaccine recipients were also determined, and they were found to be not significantly different from those in cohorts of placebo-vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. In summary, we conclude that vaccination with rgp120 has had,to date, no obvious beneficial or adverse effects on the individuals we have studied."
5797,0.001,1.0000,"Microglia represent the main cellular targets of HIV-1 in the brain. Infected and/or activated microglia play a pathogenic role in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) by instigating primary dysfunction and subsequent death of neurons. Although microglia are known to secrete neurotoxins when infected with HIV-1, the detailed mechanism of neurotoxicity remains unclear. Using a human microglia primary culture system and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, we have now demonstrated that HIV-1 infection of microglia resulted in a significant increase in extracellular glutamate concentrations and elevated levels of neurotoxicity. RNA and protein analysis revealed upregulation of the glutamate-generating enzyme glutaminase isoform glutaminase C in HIV-1-infected microglia. The clinical relevance of these findings was further corroborated with investigation of postmortem brain tissues. The glutaminase C levels in the brain tissues of HIV dementia individuals were significantly higher than HIV serum-negative control and correlated with elevated concentrations of glutamate. When glutaminase was subsequently inhibited by siRNA or by a small molecular inhibitor, the HIV-induced glutamate production and the neuronal loss was diminished. In conclusion, these findings support glutaminase as a potential component of the HAND pathogenic process as well as a novel therapeutic target in their treatment."
1817,0.001,1.0000,"The frequency of CCR5-Delta32 allele in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the southern Brazilian population was determined in a cross-sectional study carried out from October 2001 to June 2004. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells of 134 healthy blood donors, 145 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals, 152 HIV-1-seropositive asymptomatic individuals, and 478 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with AIDS. A fragment with 225 base-pairs of the CCR5 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The CCR5-Delta32 homozygous deletion was observed in 2 (1.5%) blood donors and in 1 (0.7%) individual HIV-1-exposed seronegative, and was absent among all the HIV-1-seropositive individuals (Fisher's exact test, p=0.0242). The frequency of the homozygous CCR5-Delta32 deletion in the HIV-1-exposed did not differ when compared with that observed in the HIV-1 seronegative blood donors (Fisher's exact test, p=0.6093; OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 0.11-129.6). The wild-type genotype CCR5/CCR5 frequency was higher among the HIV-1-seropositive with AIDS compared to HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic individuals (Chi-square test, p=0.0263; OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.03-3.97). The absence of the homozygous deletion of CCR5-Delta32 among HIV-1-seropositive individuals underscored that this genotype is an important genetic factor associated with the decreased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The higher frequency of heterozygosity for the CCR5-Delta32 and the CCR5-Delta32 allele in HIV-1 seropositive asymptomatic compared to HIV-seropositive with AIDS individuals also underscored that this deletion could be associated with the delay of the HIV-1 disease progression in this population. However, the low frequency of CCR5-Delta32 homozygosity observed among HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals shows that the allele could not explain, by itself, the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection and different mechanisms of protection against HIV-1 infection that must be involved in this population."

A pilot study was undertaken to determine acemannan's effect in 49 feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infected cats with clinical signs of disease (Stage 3, 4 or 5), 23 of which had severe lymphopenia. Cats received acemannan either by intravenous (Group 1) or subcutaneous (Group 2) injection once weekly for 12 weeks, or by daily oral (Group 3) administration for 12 weeks. Upon entry into the study, cats were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Laboratory analyses were performed at the beginning of the study and at Weeks 6 and 12. Cats were allowed to continue with a predetermined maintenance regimen of acemannan after completing the 12-week study. Thirteen cats died during the course of treatment. Upon necropsy, the most frequent histopathologic findings were neoplastic, kidney and pancreatic disease. Friedman's two-way ANOVA test showed no significant differences in efficacy among groups administered acemannan by the different routes. Therefore, groups were combined and a signed-ranks test was used to determine changes over time. A significant increase was seen in lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001). Neutrophil counts decreased significantly (P = 0.007), as did incidence of sepsis (P = 0.008). When cats entering with lymphopenia were analyzed separately, a much greater increase in lymphocyte counts was noted (235%) compared with non-lymphopenic cats (42%). A survival rate of 75% was found for all three groups. Thirty-six of 49 animals are alive 5-19 months post-entry. These results suggest that acemannan therapy may be of significant benefit in FIV-infected cats exhibiting clinical signs of disease."
3771,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and the varied outcomes of the infection depend on both viral and host factors. We have demonstrated that the HCV alternate reading frame protein (F protein) is related to Th1/Th2 bias which is involved in virus persistence in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic variants of TBX21 (T cell specific T-box transcription factor) were associated with the outcomes of HCV infection and F protein generation. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs17250932, rs2074190, rs4794067) in the TBX21 gene were genotyped in a case-control study in a cohort of a high-risk group, including 354 healthy controls and 747 CHC patients (190 anti-F protein antibody seronegative patients and 557 anti-F protein antibody seropositive patients). Results showed that the rs4794067 C allele in the TBX21 promoter was significantly more common in CHC patients (OR = 1.335, 95% CI = 1.058-1.684, P = 0.015), exceptionally in anti-F protein seropositive patients (OR = 1.547, 95% CI = 1.140-2.101, P = 0.005), compared with healthy controls. And the risk effect was also significantly high in patients with HCV 1b genotype and mild fibrosis (P = 0.021, P = 0.010, respectively). Compared with the most frequent haplotype TAT, haplotype analysis showed that the distribution of TAC was significantly different between the chronic HCV carrier group and the healthy group, and so was the anti-F antibody seronegativity group and the anti-F antibody seronegativity group (all P < 0.001). Our results suggested that TBX21 variants may be involved in the etiology of this disease."
5549,0.001,1.0000,"The total number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in South Africa was estimated from a number of sources of seroprevalence for each of these viruses. A total figure of 122,951 HIV-infected individuals in South Africa was arrived at for January 1991; 69% (85,247) were from the urban black population and 20% (24,474) from the rural black population. The male homosexual population constituted some 7% (8,175) of the total, 94% of whom were white; however, this probably represented a substantial underestimation of the size of this population. A total of 1,475,223 carriers of HBV virus was calculated for South Africa from data obtained from 1986 to 1990. Of these, 88% (1,302,741) came from the rural black population and 8% (114,118) from the urban black population. Extrapolations from small sample numbers and often with broad assumptions are subject to considerable error.

5070,0.001,1.0000,"The principle of directly observed therapy (DOT) has its roots in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), for which DOT programs have improved cure rates in hard-to-reach populations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB affect similar populations, and there are concerns about both regarding the development of drug resistance associated with poor adherence to therapy. Accordingly, DOT may benefit certain HIV-infected people who have difficulty adhering to highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, important differences exist in the treatment of these diseases that raise questions about how DOT can be adapted to HIV therapy. DOT for management of HIV infection has been effective among prisoners and in pilot programs in Haiti, Rhode Island, and Florida. Although DOT can successfully treat HIV infection in marginalized populations in the short term, a multitude of questions remain. This review provides an account of the preliminary development of DOT programs for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals."
2093,0.001,1.0000,"Substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is an important immunomodulator of lymphocyte and monocyte/macrophage function. We have examined the effects of SP on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Human monocytes isolated by Ficoll gradient followed by adherence were maintained in vitro for 10 days and infected with HIV-1. The addition of SP resulted in a 2- to 8-fold-enhanced HIV-1 expression in the MDMs isolated from 7 of 13 healthy donors as determined by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and p24 protein expression assays, as compared to control cultures incubated with HIV-1 alone. There was no correlation observed, however, between SP-stimulated TNF production and HIV-1 expression in MDMs obtained from a subset of these donors. These effects of SP on HIV-1 expression in MDMs in vitro may have in vivo implications relevant to modulation of monocyte/macrophage functions, to HIV-1 infection of monocytes/macrophages, and to the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection."
9189,0.001,1.0000,"The inflamed liver in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB) is characterized by a large influx of non-virus-specific CD8 T cells. Little is known about the functional capacity of these lymphocytes, which could provide insights into mechanisms of failure of viral control and liver damage in this setting. We compared the effector function of total circulating and intrahepatic CD8 T cells in CHB patients and healthy donors. We demonstrated that CD8 T cells from CHB patients, regardless of their antigen specificity, were impaired in their ability to produce interleukin-2 and proliferate upon TCR-dependent stimulation. In contrast, these CD8 T cells had preserved production of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This aberrant functional profile was partially attributable to down-regulation of the proximal T cell receptor signaling molecule CD3zeta, and could be corrected in vitro by transfection of CD3zeta or replenishment of the amino acid arginine required for its expression. We provide evidence for depletion of arginine in the inflamed hepatic microenvironment as a potential mechanism for these defects in global CD8 T cell signaling and function. These data imply that polarized CD8 T cells within the HBV-infected liver may impede proliferative antiviral effector function, while contributing to the proinflammatory cytokine environment."
9816,0.001,1.0000,"Eleven (nine CD4+ and two CD8+) protein purified derivative-specific and eight tetanus toxoid-specific T cell clones (TCC), established from the peripheral blood of healthy persons, were cocultured in vitro with irradiated mononuclear cells from patients infected by HIV in the presence of PHA and polybrene. Two weeks post-HIV exposure, all 17 CD4+, but neither of the two CD8+, TCC exhibited integration of HIV in their genoma, as detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and released HIV into their supernatants, as detected by measuring both reverse transcriptase activity and p24 Ag. When co-cultured with either autologous or allogeneic B cells, all CD4+ HIV-infected TCC induced the synthesis of extraordinarily high amounts of IgM, IgG, and IgA. In contrast, their noninfected counterparts could provide helper function for Ig synthesis by autologous B cells only in the presence of the specific Ag (or anti-CD3 antibody), and induced allogeneic B cells to synthesize Ig only upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. The supernatants of HIV-infected TCC failed to stimulate Ig synthesis in B cells. More importantly, when HIV-infected clonal T blasts and B cells were cultured in different chambers separated by a millipore membrane, permeable to molecules but not to cells, Ig synthesis did not occur. The Ig synthesis induced by HIV-infected TCC was also markedly inhibited by the addition in culture of either anti-CD4 or anti-LFA-1 antibody. In contrast, HIV-infected TCC maintained their ability to provide helper function for Ig synthesis in the absence of any stimulus, even after fixation with p-formaldehyde. These data demonstrate that in vitro infection with HIV enables human T cells to stimulate Ig synthesis by B cells by an Ag-nonspecific, MHC-unrestricted, contact-dependent mechanism. This may explain, at least in part, the hypergammaglobulinemia and other phenomena related to polyclonal B cell activation frequently seen in HIV-infected persons."
7525,0.001,1.0000,"A subpopulation of stably infected CD4+ cells capable of producing virus upon stimulation has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (T.-W. Chun, D. Finzi, J. Margolick, K. Chadwick, D. Schwartz, and R. F. Siliciano, Nat. Med. 1:1284-1290, 1995). Few host factors that directly limit HIV-1 transcription and could support this state of nonproductive HIV-1 infection have been described. YY1, a widely distributed human transcription factor, is known to inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription and virus production. LSF (also known as LBP-1, UBP, and CP-2) has been shown to repress LTR transcription in vitro, but transient expression of LSF has no effect on LTR activity in vivo. We report that both YY1 and LSF participate in the formation of a complex that recognizes the initiation region of the HIV-1 LTR. Further, we have found that these factors cooperate in the repression of LTR expression and viral replication. This cooperative function may account for the divergent effects of LSF previously observed in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the cooperation of two general cellular transcription factors may allow for the selective downregulation of HIV transcription. Through this mechanism of gene regulation, YY1 and LSF could contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a population of cells stably but nonproductively infected with HIV-1."
1319,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had spread unrecognized in the human population as sexually transmitted disease and was finally identified by its disease AIDS in 1981. Even after the isolation of the causative agent in 1983, the burden and death rate of AIDS accelerated worldwide especially in young people despite the confection of new drugs capable to inhibit virus replication since 1997. However, at least in industrialised countries, this trend could be reversed by the introduction of combination therapy strategies. The design of new drugs is on going; besides the inhibition of the three enzymes of HIV for replication and maturation (reverse transcriptase, integrase and protease), further drugs inhibits fusion of viral and cellular membranes and virus maturation. On the other hand, viral diagnostics had been considerably improved since the emergence of HIV. There was a need to identify infected people correctly, to follow up the course of immune reconstitution of patients by measuring viral load and CD4 cells, and to analyse drug escape mutations leading to drug resistance. Both the development of drugs and the refined diagnostics have been transferred to the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This progress is not completed; there are beneficial aspects in the response of the scientific community to the HIV burden for the management of other viral diseases. These aspects are described in this contribution. Further aspects as handling a stigmatising disease, education of self-responsiveness within sexual relationships, and ways for confection of a protective vaccine are not covered."
57,0.001,1.0000,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."
6760,0.001,1.0000,"The objective was to determine whether there is an association between carriage of oral yeasts, malnutrition and HIV-1 infection among Tanzanian children. A case-control study design within a cross-sectional study was used, and the outcome was carriage of oral yeasts. The exposure variables were malnutrition and HIV-1 antibody, and confounders to be adjusted for were age, sex, and breastfeeding. The study was carried out in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, in two maternal and child health (MCH) clinics that offer routine medical checkups to all expectant mothers and children aged between 0 and 5 years in the catchment area. A total of 882 children aged between 18 months and 5 years participated. Smears from the tongue and buccal mucosa were examined for oral yeasts. Malnutrition was categorized according to standards on the MCH chart and World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (WHO/CDC) standards as weight-for-height (wasted), weight-for-age (underweight), and height-for-age (stunted). HIV-1 infection was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive sera were confirmed by Western Blot. About 27% of the children were slightly or severely malnourished according to standards on the MCH chart. According to WHO/CDC standards, 2.6% were wasted, 16.3% were underweight, and 29.6% were stunted. Fourteen (1.6%) were seropositive for HIV-1 antibody. Hyphal forms and blastospores were much more frequent among children infected with HIV-1 with odds ratios ranging from 3.8 (95% CI: 1.3;11.2) to 6.2 (95% CI: 2.1;18.4) depending on categorization of malnutrition. Malnutrition was a risk factor, too, albeit to a much lesser and insignificant degree. The study supports our previous findings that malnutrition may predispose to carriage of oral yeasts and subsequent infection. However, in this study population HIV infection was clearly the predominant risk factor."
1634,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known about the importance of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease in acute hepatitis C. In this prospective study, 82 consecutive patients with acute hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection were enrolled. Individuals were infected with highly related HCV strains and the baseline NS3 quasispecies diversity and complexity was higher compared to a chronic hepatitis C control group (P<0.0001). Both parameters were comparable in patients with spontaneous clearance (n=6) versus treatment-induced SVR (n=5) or development of chronic hepatitis C (n=9). Longitudinal NS3 quasispecies kinetics showed a trend to a decreasing diversity and complexity (P<0.05) within 4 weeks in patients with spontaneous clearance compared to the other groups. The innate immune signalling protein CARDIF was cleaved to a similar extent independent of the outcome. Together with a more pronounced viral load decline (P<0.05), an early decreasing NS3 quasispecies evolution indicates spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C. "
5454,0.001,1.0000,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) has increased and contributes to a growing proportion of mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy. Development of novel strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of NADC will be required to reverse these epidemiologic trends and improve the survival of HIV-infected patients. "
1510,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."
9717,0.001,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
7652,0.001,1.0000,"AL 721, a lipid mixture with reported in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via cell membrane or virion cholesterol depletion, was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging trial. Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent."
5492,0.001,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is still a major health problem world-wide. HIV infection has changed into a chronic infection with the chance of developing long-term complications. Vascular complications are frequently reported in the current literature. HIV and treatment by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are associated with many cardiovascular risk factors. An increased risk of arterial cardiovascular complications was found in a number of studies. However, data about the risk of venous thrombotic disease (VTE), including potentially fatal conditions as pulmonary embolism, were limited. In a systematic review of the literature, ten relevant epidemiological studies were identified that investigated the risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients. The incidence was increased two- to tenfold in comparison with a healthy population of the same age. However, these studies were mainly retrospective cohort studies that were prone to selection bias, confounding factors were not always mentioned and in all but three control populations were missing. An increased risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients could be explained by the presence of a hypercoagulable state, characterised by an increase in procoagulant factors, such as endothelial TF expression and thrombogenic properties of microparticles, and a decrease in anticoagulant factors, including AT III, HC II and the protein C pathway. Furthermore, the risk of VTE was associated with an increased risk of infections and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and was weakly associated with HAART. All together, quite some evidence pointed towards a relationship between HIV infection and venous thrombotic disease, but the association still needs to be established in properly designed epidemiological studies."
8223,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of the two year (2003-2005) study was to study the HIV prevalence among high risk behavior groups of persons with Herpes Zoster infection. For this purpose we have investigated the high risk group patients: 1257 prisoners (1st group), 1543 IDUs (2nd group) and 1350 persons including: homosexuals, persons with history of frequent unprotected sex and persons with hepatitis B and C (3rd group). We revealed the persons with current or previous history of Herpes Zoster, and studied HIV prevalence among them. Besides, we have studied the immune status of revealed HIV positive persons, relationship between disease (Herpes Zoster) severity and CD4 count. Herpes Zoster infection was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, anamnesis and by detection of VZV specific IgM and IgG by ELISA. HIV infection was diagnosed by ELISA method and was confirmed by Western Blot. CD4 count was detected by immunophenotyping technique and was analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. The total prevalence of HIV infection among high risk behavior group persons with Herpes Zoster infection was 18,9% (31 HIV cases out of 164). The disease (Herpes Zoster) severity and duration was associated with decreased rate of cellular immunity, CD4 count. Herpes Zoster has a positive predictive value for HIV infection, predominantly recurrent Herpes Zoster. Herpes Zoster should be recognized as a marker condition indicating the necessity of screening for HIV, especially in Georgia, the region where the problem of IDU exists."
5823,0.001,1.0000,"Nevirapine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as part of combination therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Nevirapine may be prescribed for patients with hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Significant autoinduction of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2B6 following multiple dosing prompted an assessment of the metabolic profiles in patients with liver disease receiving chronic nevirapine therapy. HIV-infected patients with hepatic fibrosis who were receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine for > or = 6 weeks had liver biopsy specimens assessed by Ishak histologic scoring and were grouped by severity (group 1, Ishak scores of 1 and 2; group 2, Ishak scores of 3 and 4; group 3, Ishak scores of 5 and 6). Steady-state trough nevirapine levels were determined for all patients, and additional measurements were obtained at 1, 2, and 4 h following nevirapine dosing for a subset of patients. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and its five metabolites were characterized, and a comparison of the results for the different Ishak groups was performed. Among 51 patients with hepatic fibrosis, the majority of whom were coinfected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, differences between the maximum and the minimum observed plasma concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant flattening of the systemic exposure curves with progression from Ishak group 1 to Ishak group 2 or 3, suggesting a decrease in systemic clearance with the progression of liver disease. However, there were no significant differences in the trough and the maximum nevirapine concentrations between the Ishak groups. The metabolite profiles were also comparable across the Ishak groups. In HIV-infected patients who were chronically treated with nevirapine and who had various degrees of hepatic fibrosis, including cirrhosis, trough plasma nevirapine concentrations were not significantly increased, and thus, no dose adjustment is warranted."
7705,0.001,1.0000,"Human B-lymphotropic virus (HBLV), also known as human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) was first isolated in 1986 from AIDS patients and patients with other lymphoproliferative disorders. HBLV is distinct from known human herpesviruses, biologically, immunologically and by molecular analysis. HBLV can infect and replicate in fresh and established lines of hemopoietic cells and cells of neural origin, suggesting wide tropism. The prevalence of HBLV antibody in the normal population was 26% though clear differences between different populations were observed. The prevalence of HBLV antibody an elevated antibody titer was higher in sera from certain malignancies, Sjögren's syndrome and sarcoidosis. Antibody to HBLV was also elevated in AIDS patients and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. HBLV-DNA was detected in some B-cell lymphomas. The broad in vitro tropism, combined with immunological and molecular evidence of HBLV infection in individuals raise the question of the pathogenicity of this virus in some diseases. Because in vitro co-infection of CD4 cells by HBLV and HIV leads to enhanced degeneration, this raises the possibility that infection in AIDS patients by both viruses can aggravate the HIV-induced immunodeficiency. Specific reagents and immunological and molecular assays are currently being investigated, which will aid in virus detection in cells from patients, and in elucidating the possible pathogenesis of HBLV."
5142,0.001,1.0000,"We have investigated hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in systemic necrotizing vasculitis (SNV). Our approach included the detection of the viral surface antigen (HBsAg) with a radioimmunoassay employing monoclonal anti-HBs (m-RIA); in addition, HBV DNA was looked for in serum and peripheral mononuclear blood cells. Among 28 subjects with SNV, 12 were found to be positive for HBsAg with the conventional test (p-RIA) and 7 additional subjects had anti-HBc and/or anti-HBs. From the 16 HBsAg negative individuals, 9 had HBsAg epitopes identified in serum with the m-RIA test and 1 had a low amount of circulating viral DNA. In contrast, only 1 among 6 subjects with other systemic vasculitis showed a positive test for m-RIA and HBV DNA assays; this individual had acquired HIV infection through transfusions which were also probably the source of his HBV infection. HBV DNA sequences were identified in peripheral mononuclear blood cells of 9 from the 37 tested, including 2 individuals who were HBsAg positive only with m-RIA. Therefore, our study indicates a much higher rate of HBV infection in patients with polyarteritis nodosa than previously suspected."
138,0.001,1.0000,"Microsporidia are increasingly being recognised as important enteric pathogens in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."
9179,0.001,1.0000,"We analyzed the kinetics of CD4 cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, and autoantibodies in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with Graves' disease (GD) after immune restoration on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; retrospective study). Five patients (median age, 41 yr) were diagnosed with GD after 20 (range, 14-22) months on HAART on the basis of clinical and biological hyperthyroidism, diffuse hyperfixation of thyroid scan, and the presence of anti-TSH receptor (anti-TSHR) antibodies (Ab). GD was diagnosed several months after the plasma HIV ribonucleic acid load became undetectable, when the CD4+ cell count had risen from 14 (range, 0-62) to 340 (range, 163-460) x 10(6) cells/L. Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-TSHRAb appeared 14 (range, 9-18) and 14 (range, 11-20) months after starting HAART and 12 (range, 6-15) and 11 (range, 9-17) months after the increase in CD4+ cells. In 3 patients, TPOAb preceded TSHRAb by 3-10 months. No other autoantibodies were detected. Thyroid antibodies were absent in a group of 55 HIV-1-positive patients with comparable response to HAART and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism (cross-sectional study). Thyroid-specific autoimmunity can occur upon immune restoration with HAART. Our observations suggest a relationship between thymus-dependent immune reconstitution after immunosuppression and autoimmunity and may provide insight into the pathophysiology of GD."
1398,0.001,1.0000,"Seven AIDS patients who were receiving suppressive therapy for previously diagnosed cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis were offered treatment with protease inhibitors (PIs). Secondary prophylaxis for CMV was discontinued after 3 months of therapy with PIs if patients had >150 CD4 cells/mm3 and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load of <200 copies/mL and if they were negative for CMV as determined by qualitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ophthalmologic exams were done periodically. After a median follow-up of 9 months (range, 9-12), no new episodes of CMV retinitis were observed. CD4 cell counts were >150 cells/mm3 in all cases, HIV loads were <200 copies/mL, and results for qualitative CMV PCRs remained negative. These observations suggest that for selected patients with healed CMV retinitis who have immunologic and virologic evidence of a clinical response to potent combination antiretroviral therapy, temporary discontinuation of a chronic anti-CMV suppressive therapy may not result in further retinal necrosis. However, the long-term immunologic benefit of PIs and hence the safety of prolonged withdrawal of anti-CMV therapy is unknown."
8473,0.001,1.0000,"Variation in the time to AIDS and duration of survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected persons was recognized early in the epidemic. Recent studies have indicated that the rate of viral replication, as manifest by the number of copies of HIV RNA per milliliter of plasma, is a major determinant of outcome in an infected person. The predictive power of the measurement of plasma HIV RNA copy number is enhanced by combining this result with the CD4 lymphocyte number. The determinants of the rate of viral replication are less clearly defined. Recent studies suggest that polymorphism of the chemokine receptors, required for cellular infection, plays a role in regulating the rate of viral replication. The subsequent adaptive evolution of HIV-1 to the host's immune response is a consequence of this dynamic of the virus. Complicating opportunistic infections also appear to enhance HIV-1 replication, while antiviral therapy, in contrast, can and does suppress viral replication."
5402,0.001,1.0000,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
7166,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study is to examine whether internalized AIDS stigma among HIV patients one year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, quality of life (QoL), and ARV adherence. This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
7348,0.001,1.0000,"Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."

Screening possibilities are limited. Recent data concerning the prevalence of infections with blood-borne and sexually transmitted agents are not available from this country. To investigate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2) and other blood-borne or sexually transmitted agents we tested a total of 256 serum samples collected in the summer of 1995 from blood donors, hospitalized children and adults in Mogadishu. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carrier rate was 191%, 5.6% and 21.3 % among blood donors, hospitalized children and hospitalized adults, respectively. However, no children under 2 years of age were HbsAg positive. The overall presence of antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) was 2.4% (6/256). In blood donors this was 0.6% (1/157). In none of the samples tested, antibodies against HIV 1 and 2 or human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV I and II) were detected. Our results indicate that, during the civil war in Somalia, no evidence of an increase of HIV infections was found. Our findings indicate that preventive measures in Somalia should focus mainly on prevention of HBV-infections. HBV-vaccine could be administered within the framework of the expanded programme on immunization, as none of the children less than 2 years of age were HbsAg positive."
5234,0.001,1.0000,"Nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is a major cause of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance; however the level of nonadherence associated with the greatest risk of resistance is unknown. Beginning in February 2000, 195 patients at the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center (Baltimore, MD) who were receiving HAART and who had HIV loads of <500 copies/mL were recruited into a cohort study and observed for 1 year. At each visit, adherence to HAART was assessed and plasma samples were obtained and stored for resistance testing, if indicated. The overall incidence of viral rebound with clinically significant resistance was 14.5 cases per 100 person-years. By multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, a cumulative adherence of 70%-89%, a CD4 cell nadir of <200 cells/microL, and the missing of a scheduled clinic visit in the past month were independently associated with an increased hazard of viral rebound with clinically significant resistance. Clinicians and patients must set high adherence goals to avoid the development of resistance."
6604,0.001,1.0000,"Resistance to HIV-1 infection in Europeans is associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for the CCR5 protein that is present in Th2 cells and serves as a coreceptor for HIV-1 R5 strain. A deletion of 32 amino acids from the cytokine receptor prevents infection. This mutation prevails in Europeans and is absent in Africans. However, duplication of a gene that codes for a chemokine that binds to the CCR5 was discovered in Africans (mean gene copy 6 while in non-Africans the mean gene copy is 3). Higher expression of these genes protects T cells against HIV-1 infection in vitro. It should be noted that resistance to HIV-1 R5 variant does not protect against HIV-1 R4 variant. It was reported that a minority of highly HIV-1 exposed African professional sex workers (APSW) were resistant to the virus infection during a 10 years period. Recently, the analysis of the cytokines in the serum of the persistently infected seronegative women revealed that the latter hypo-expresses the cytokine IL-4. Since the molecular events during HIV-1 infection are associated with a marked increase in the levels of IL-4 and IgE in the sera of the infected individuals, it suggests that AIDS is an allergy. Thus, a very low level of IL-4 production may abrogate the virus infection. Studies on the human IL-4 gene revealed that together with the IL-4 mRNA a spliced variant with a deletion of exon 2 is synthesized. The latter is a natural antagonist of IL-4 and when expressed in an individual at a level higher than IL-4, the person will resist a microbial infection (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or asthma. The present hypothesis suggests that the HIV-1 resistant APSWs produce more IL-4 delta 2 molecules than IL-4 molecules. The binding of IL-4 delta 2 to IL-4 receptors on T and B cells prevents their functions and the infection by HIV-1. The implications of these studies are that treatment of HIV-1 infected people with drugs that will block the IL-4 receptors will stop HIV-1 infections and the determination of the levels of IL-4 and IL-4 delta 2 in the sera of HIV-1+ patients will enable to identify the individuals that have a natural resistance to HIV-l/AIDS and those who need treatments."

Young adults are most often newly infected, thus research is needed to assess medication adherence barriers specific to young adults with HIV.

Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors related to viral suppression and sexually transmitted infection (STI) status. A total of 335 individuals presented for care during a 12-month period at a single clinic. The majority were African American and had a mean age of 25.6 years. Nearly all had current prescriptions of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among those receiving ART, almost three-quarters were virally suppressed, as measured by 200 copies/mL. STI tests are conducted annually and by assessed need; 30% of this sample had at least 1 bacterial STI diagnosis within the last year. Psychological distress symptoms were more common among individuals who were not virally suppressed, compared to those who were virally suppressed. Women and individuals with moderate to severe symptoms of depression had higher odds of having unsuppressed viral loads. The independent factors associated with having any STIs were being African American or other minorities and having two or more sex partners. Our findings related to how young adults are managing their HIV care suggest that increased efforts aimed to prevent additional STIs and manage psychological distress will likely reduce transmission risks."
2016,0.001,1.0000,"""Phylodynamic"" analysis combines various statistical procedures that can be used to correlate the epidemiological and evolutionary behavior of viral pathogens with the immune system of the host. We utilized this approach to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope DNA sequences (V1, V2, and V3) isolated from different brain compartments of a T-cell-depleted patient diagnosed with severe HIV-associated dementia at the time of death. In agreement with previous reports, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct virodemes but also revealed a significant amount of viral gene flow among different brain compartments. Local-molecular-clock analysis showed that HIV-1 meninges and temporal lobe subpopulations evolve about 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than the other viral populations in the brain. However, maximum likelihood codon-based substitution models did not detect any site under significant positive selective pressure, and the main cause of HIV-1 genetic variation appeared to be random genetic drift. Therefore, the higher evolutionary rate in the meninges and temporal lobe could be due to an enhanced infection/expansion rate of macrophages as a consequence of the immune system failure. In conclusion, in this case study, viral infection in the brain progressed with a nonspecific genetic evolution, recurrent migration events, and an expansion of macrophage-tropic sequences. The data suggest that after immune failure newly produced viral variants, which would be rapidly cleared under normal conditions, begin to productively infect macrophages in a ""self-amplifying"" cycle of infection/inflammatory response that could be at the origin of HIV-associated dementia."
3426,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a public health problem. In France, 0.68% of adults are chronically infected. We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infections newly diagnosed in 2011 in University hospitals of Marseille, the second largest French city. HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Levels of the liver biological parameters were significantly lower in women compared to men, in whom mean alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase levels were 24 ± 39 versus 37 ± 36 IU/l (P = 0.0001) and 20 ± 20 versus 51 ± 53 IU/l (P = 0.0001), respectively. Co-infections with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses were found in 5% and 6% of the patients, respectively. HBV DNA was detectable in 90% of the HBeAg-negative patients. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the HBsAg titer and the HBV DNA level (P = 0.001). Genotype D was the most common HBV genotype and was found in 53% of the patients tested, followed by genotype E (21%). HBV remains a major concern with a slightly greater number of new diagnoses than in 2004. HBV genetic diversity was substantial in the present cohort."
2226,0.001,1.0000,"In this study, we investigated the causes of death and the factors associated with mortality in a cohort of patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Burkina Faso, an African country with limited resources. This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 15 years and older who started HAART for the first time between January 2003 and December 2008 in 14 health districts. We used survival analyses, including the Kaplan-Meier method, to examine potential predictors of death and two Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios for death, first from baseline covariates and then from time-dependent covariates. A total of 6641 patients initiated HAART during this period; of these, 5608 were included in the analysis. By the end of the study period, 4310 of those patients were still receiving HAART, 690 had died, 207 had been transferred and 401 were lost to follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 23.2 months [interquartile range (IQR): 12.4-36.9], and the overall incidence of mortality was 6 per 100 person-years. The clinical stage, CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin level, HAART regimen, gender, age, profession and year of initiation were the primary risk factors associated with death. In the multivariate analysis, BMI, clinical stage, treatment regimen and CD4 count remained significantly associated with death. The most frequent causes of death were wasting syndrome, tuberculosis and anaemia. This result highlights the already advanced stage of immunodeficiency among patients in Burkina Faso when they start HAART. Testing patients for HIV and starting antiretroviral therapy earlier are necessary to further reduce the mortality of patients living with HIV. This study provides a solid evidence base with which future evaluations of HAART in Burkina Faso can be compared."
9327,0.001,1.0000,"The prognosis of HIV infection has been modified by antiretroviral therapy. However, the morbidity and the mortality of HCV co-infection increase and may be a major problem of health service. Up to now co-infected patients are excluded of transplantation due to complexity, the ethical aspects, the immunodeficiency and the co-infection. This study tries to estimate the feasibility in this population. Between December 1999 and March 2002, seven patients were transplanted. The average of CD4 was 332/ml; the viral load was <50 copies/ml. Before transplantation, no patient had experienced opportunist infection and all patients received antiretroviral therapy adapted to their history. The average follow-up is of 14 months: one patient died 3 months after transplantation, the other one presented a candida in oesophagus, the average of CD4 was 280/ml, and viral load was <50 copies/ml in five patients. A relapse of HVC was observed in all patients. Interferon/rivabirine therapy was proposed for four patients. Every patient received tacrolimus and corticoids. HAART were modified four times for toxicity and one time for virological failure. We observed two cases of transient renal insufficiency, two cases of diabetes, two cases of pancreatitis, and abnormalities of the respiratory mitochondrial chain in four patients. Finally, liver transplantation in HIV-HCV co-infected patients seems to be feasible when strict criteria of selection are taken into account. This still experimental strategy requires a multidisciplinary partnership."
5596,0.001,1.0000,"Dual seroreactivity to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 is common in Côte d'Ivoire. To assess whether dual infection is the reason for dual seroreactivity, different methods for detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses were compared. PCR on primary uncultured lymphocytes of 56 dually seropositive samples revealed the presence of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proviral DNA in 23 (41%) cases. In 7 other dual seropositive persons, PCR was carried out on the primary lymphocytes as well as on lymphocytes after 3 and 6 weeks of cocultivation. More cultures, 5/7 (71%), were positive for both viruses at 3 weeks compared to 0/7 at 6 weeks post cultivation. Moreover, 2 out of 3 samples, where only HIV-1 was detected in uncultured cells, were positive for both viruses after 3 weeks of cultivation. These data indicate that the sensitivity of HIV-2 detection can be increased by stimulation of patients' lymphocytes. A higher number of dual seropositive individuals (10/23 (48%)) had antibodies able to neutralize simultaneously both HIV-1 and HIV-2 prototype viruses than did HIV-1 antibody-positive sera (5/21 (24%)) or HIV-2 antibody positive sera (3/18 (17%)). The prevalence of dual seropositives being infected with both viruses is highly dependent on the method used to detect infection. There is a need to standardize virological markers in order to gain a better insight into the relative proportions of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 dually infected persons."
4896,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare both the safety and tolerability and the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses for two influenza virus subunit vaccines, one with MF59 adjuvant (Fluad) and one without an adjuvant (Agrippal), in healthy and in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected adult individuals. To achieve this aim, an open, randomized, comparative clinical trial was performed during the 2005-2006 season. A total of 256 subjects were enrolled to receive one dose of vaccine intramuscularly. Blood samples were taken at the time of vaccination and at 1 and 3 months postvaccination. A good humoral antibody response was detected for both vaccines, meeting all the criteria of the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use. After Beyer's correction for prevaccination status, Fluad exhibited better immunogenicity than Agrippal, as shown from the analysis of the geometric mean titers, with significant differences for some virus strains; however, no definitive conclusions on the clinical significance of such results can be drawn, because the method used to estimate antibody response is currently nonstandard for influenza virus vaccines. Significant induction of an antigen-specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte proliferative response was detected at all time points after immunization, for both the vaccines, among HIV-1-seronegative subjects. This was different from what was observed for HIV-1-infected individuals. In this group, significance was not reached at 30 days postvaccination (T30) for those immunized with Agrippal. Also when data were compared between treatment groups, a clear difference in the response at T30 was observed in favor of Fluad (P = 0.0002). The safety profiles of both vaccines were excellent. For HIV-1-infected individuals, no significant changes either in viremia or in the CD4+ cell count were observed at any time point. The results showed good safety and immunogenicity for both vaccines under study for both uninfected and HIV-1-infected adults, confirming current recommendations for immunization of this high-risk category."
8321,0.001,1.0000,"Previous research has been inconsistent in documenting a strong relationship between depression and HIV/AIDS, although a recent meta-analysis of studies examining this issue indicates that rates of depression are modestly higher for this population. For the current study, conducted from 2001-2004, we sought to examine rates and types of depressive symptoms in a cohort of patients receiving HIV care at two urban medical centers. These patients were participants in an intervention study examining adherence and mental health in persons triply diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and HIV/AIDS. Nearly three quarters of these participants were people of color, two thirds described their sexual orientation as heterosexual, and the vast majority were unemployed. We sought to examine the relationship of depression to patients' adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]). Results obtained from structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires indicated that study participants experienced high rates of depressive symptoms, and that 72.9% of participants met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of this study offer a detailed view of the incidence and nature of MDDs and depressive symptoms for an urban sample of substance-abusing adults with HIV/AIDS. Given the degree to which depressive symptoms and MDD appear to be prevalent for this group, as well as the observation that these symptoms are amenable to treatment, future research should focus on identifying helpful strategies and interventions for treating these symptoms, effective ways of providing linkages to care, and ways in which standardized assessment and treatment protocols might be adapted to better suit this population."
3697,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was the development of a panel constituted by well-defined HIV-1 strains of different genetic forms, with a particular focus on isolates from acute and recent infections. Fourteen HIV-1 isolates, including four from acute and five from recent infections, were expanded in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SI phenotype, coreceptors use, and TCID(50)/ml were determined. V3 net charge was calculated. Near full-length genomes were amplified by RT-nested PCR in four overlapping segments. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of cysteine residues, lengths of variable regions, and potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 was performed. Viral stocks were produced. Thirteen strains were NSI/R5 and one SI/R5,X4. TCID(50)/ml ranged between 10(4.6) and 10(6). V3 net charge was <+5 in 12 sequences and +5 in two sequences. Near full-length HIV-1 genomes analysis identified viruses of the following genetic forms: eight subtype B, three subtype C, two CRF02_AG, and one subtype G. Cysteine residues that form the V1,V2,V3, and V4 loops were highly conserved. The number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 ranged between 24-29 and 4-6, respectively. Seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and three in gp41 were conserved. V1, V2, V4, and V5 variable regions exhibited substantial length variation. In addition, an analysis of transmitted and natural resistance to current antiretroviral drugs in these strains was performed. It is worth mentioning that the 13S mutation in the V3 sequence, associated with resistance to maraviroc, was observed in a subtype B strain that harbored resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and to T20. The availability of a panel including strains from acute and recent infections should be a valuable resource for optimizing and standardizing vaccine candidate assessment. Near full-length genome characterization may be necessary for evaluating clade-specific reactivities."
1603,0.001,1.0000,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."
8391,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) non-B clade viral infections of the brain have not been studied to date. Among nine AIDS patients from Nairobi, Kenya, infected with HIV-1 A (N = 5) or D (N = 4) clade strains, brain-derived HIV-1 env sequences displayed greater evolutionary distance than B clade brain-derived viruses (P < 0.001). Similarly, molecular diversity between matched brain and spleen env clones was clade-dependent and concentrated in the hypervariable V4 region (P < 0.001), with phylogenetic clustering of sequences derived from the same organ. Brain-derived A and D clade sequences displayed significantly lower ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rates (d(N)/d(S)) compared to matched spleen-derived clones and brain-derived B clade viruses. Interclade recombination events were infrequently observed among the present env sequences. A chimeric virus containing the C2V3 region from an A clade brain-derived sequence preferentially used CD4 and CCR5 for infection. These findings demonstrate that differences in molecular diversity in brain-derived sequences were dependent on the individual clade and domain within the env gene, but both B and non-B clade brain-derived viruses exhibit a preference for CCR5 as a coreceptor."
2092,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence and transmission routes were investigated in several groups of the Moroccan population. This study showed a low HCV seroprevalence in the Moroccan general population. However, haemodialysis patients and haemophiliacs were at higher risk of having HCV infection, since the prevalences were, respectively, 35.1 and 42.4% in comparison with the blood donors' prevalence (1.1%). These results indicated that parenteral exposure is the transmission pathway of HCV. To investigate the possibility of vertical HCV transmission, a cohort of healthy, unselected pregnant women were included in the study. A prevalence of 1% was found among them. Seven newborns were anti-HCV-positive, although, when RT-PCR was used to search for HCV RNA in their sera, none of them was viraemic. These data indicated that anti-HCV antibodies were passively acquired in these cases. We concluded that vertical transmission is absent when mothers are at low risk of contracting other parenterally or sexually transmitted diseases. Three percent of a group of patients of a centre for sexually transmitted diseases were repeatedly anti-HCV-positive, suggesting the possible sexual transmission of HCV. When screening 116 sera of anti-HIV-positive subjects, 19.8% were anti-HCV-positive. Furthermore, 17.9% of the sixty-seven patients who were proven to have sexually contracted HIV were also anti-HCV-positive. These data might reflect a likely cotransmission of these two viruses, hence suggesting HIV is a cofacter for HCV sexual transmission, as previously reported."
7493,0.001,1.0000,"Despite the importance of understanding the epidemiology of agents responsible for infectious diarrhea in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) population, the number of articles about this subject is relatively few. The current article summarizes published data on bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic enteropathogens in the HIV/AIDS seropositive subjects in different countries, regions and localities. In general, there is a great difference in the frequencies of etiological agents due to factors which include immune status, geographical location, climate and socioeconomic conditions. It is important to stress that a great prevalence of infection by emergent agents has been reported in the more advanced stages of AIDS. Therefore, to establish specific treatment depends directly on knowledge of these agents and risk factors associated to their distribution. Moreover, the colonization by potential pathogenic agents verified in these individuals is high thus implicating that they act as carriers. Finally, public health measures of control and prevention must take into consideration the regional previously identified enteropathogens, especially in areas where HIV prevalence is high."
7187,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors has led to dramatic decrease in the morbidity and mortality resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1. However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."
1145,0.001,1.0000,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
3028,0.001,1.0000,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
627,0.001,1.0000,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is a concern because it may reduce the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Plasma samples of 119 HIV-1-infected patients who were newly diagnosed at the Infectology Center of Latvia in 2005 and 2006 were analyzed by an in-house genotypic resistance assay to determine the prevalence of TDR in Latvia. TDR was identified using the WHO 2009 list of mutations for surveillance of TDR as implemented in the Stanford Calibrated Population Resistance tool. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses were used to determine genetic subtype and investigate the relatedness of the sequences. Resistance testing was successful in 117 of 119 patients. The study population represented ∼20% of all patients that were diagnosed in Latvia in 2005 and 2006 and was well distributed between gender, transmission routes, and areas of residence. Four patients showed evidence of TDR, which represents a prevalence of TDR of 3.4% (95% CI: 0.9-8.5%). All four patients displayed single, but different resistance mutations (M46I, F53L, M41L, and G190A). All patients, except one, were predicted to respond well to standard first-line therapy in Latvia. The prevalence of TDR in Latvia was low, which partly may be due to the low proportion of HIV-1 patients who receive antiretroviral therapy. The results indicate that routine resistance testing in Latvia currently should be focused on patients who display treatment failure, rather than treatment naive patients."
5704,0.001,1.0000,"Viral recombination has been postulated to play two roles in the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) resistance to antiretroviral drugs. First, recombination has the capacity to associate resistance mutations expressed by distinct viruses, thereby contributing to the development of viruses with improved drug resistance. In addition, recombination could preserve diversity in regions outside those subject to strong selective pressure. In this study, we sought direct evidence for the occurrence of these processes in vivo by evaluating clonal virus populations obtained from the same patient before and after a treatment change that, while unsuccessful in controlling viral replication, led to the emergence of viruses expressing a different profile of resistance mutations. Phylogenetic studies supported the conclusion that the genotype arising after the treatment change resulted from the emergence of recombinant viruses carrying previously existing resistance mutations in novel combinations, whereas alternative explanations, including convergent evolution, were not consistent with observed genotypic changes. Despite evidence for a strong loss of genetic diversity in genomic regions coding for the protease and reverse transcriptase, diversity in regions coding for Gag and envelope was considerably higher, and recombination between the emerging viruses expressing the new pattern of resistance mutations and viral quasispecies in the previously dominant population contributed to this preservation of diversity in the envelope gene. These findings emphasize that recombination can participate in the adaptation of HIV to changing selective pressure, both by generating novel combinations of resistance mutations and by maintaining diversity in genomic regions outside those implicated in a selective sweep."
9040,0.001,1.0000,"Invasive pneumococcal infection (IPI) is the most common serious bacterial infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children. Data from a population-based pediatric HIV surveillance project were used to determine the incidence of IPI in HIV-infected children and to conduct a case-control study assessing potential risk factors for IPI in HIV-infected children. There were 50 episodes of IPI and a cumulative incidence of 6.1 cases/100 patient-years through age 7 years. Children with IPI were more likely to have a prior AIDS diagnosis (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-15.1) and higher levels of IgG and IgM (P=.01) than were controls. In a separate case-control study, the manifestations of IPI in HIV-infected children were compared with those in HIV-negative controls. Focal complication rates in the 2 groups did not differ; however, HIV-infected children were less likely than controls to have leukocytosis (P<.001) and more likely to have isolates with penicillin resistance (P=.03)."
4949,0.001,1.0000,"Since the introduction of antiviral compounds such as lamivudine and famciclovir in the treatment schedules of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the HBV polymerase gene has been observed. The selection of these mutations is generally considered the cause of viral nonresponsiveness and treatment failure. Therefore, the detection of these mutations is of clinical importance. Previously genotyped HBV strains isolated from treated and untreated patients were amplified with primers specific for the HBV polymerase region from amino acids 465 to 562. Amplified products were cloned into plasmid vectors. The clones were used as reference strains. A set of 38 highly specific oligonucleotide probes covering three different codon positions, L528M, M552V/I, and V/L/M555I, were selected. These probes were applied as 19 different lines on a membrane strip. The strips were then hybridized with PCR fragments from the reference panel, revealing the amino acids at the three codon positions simultaneously for each clone. PCR products generated from two patients infected with HBV genotypes A and C, respectively, and treated with nucleoside analogs were analyzed on these strips. A gradual increase in genetic HBV polymerase complexity was observed in follow-up samples compared to that in pretreatment samples. Additional analysis of HBV polymerase DNA fragments in recombinant plasmid clones demonstrated the existence of (i) clones with double mutations, (ii) clones with single mutations at either codon 528, 552, or 555, and (iii) the simultaneous occurrence of two or more viral populations within one sample. This line probe assay detected the complex quasispecies nature of HBV and provided some insight into the dynamics of resistance mutations."
3168,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) represent a serious public health problem affecting 350 to 400 million HBV carriers worldwide. The virus does not exclusively infect humans, but can also be found in non-human primates as in the families Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan) and Hylobatidae (gibbon), which are distributed over Africa (chimpanzee and gorilla) and Southeast Asia (orangutan and gibbon), the endemic areas of human HBV. The prevalence of asymptomatic HBV carriers reaches in gibbons 23-33% and in orangutans 15%. The genome organization of non-human primate HBVs is nearly identical to that of human HBVs. Because of this close similarity, the question of cross-transmission of HBV between species has arisen. There are many data on cross-transmission of human HBVs to the non-human primates. However, a cross-transmission of HBVs from non-human primates to humans has not been reported yet. Using more advanced diagnostic methods, the non-human primates have increasingly been identified as a reservoir of several viruses such as lymphocryptoviruses, Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CeHV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Simian foamy virus (SFV), and HBVs. Thus veterinarians, zookeepers, or people in close contact with non-human primates may potentially become infected with those viruses causing severe diseases. Enhanced awareness of prevalence, genetic relatedness and evolution of non-human primate HBVs will help prevent further spread and cross-transmission of these viruses between humans and non-human primates."
5189,0.001,1.0000,"Despite the fact that the survival of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has improved worldwide because of the increasingly powerful and highly active antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (OIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) remain a serious burden. HIV-1 is capable of entering the CNS through infected peripheral monocytes, but its effect on OIs of CNS remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with CNS OIs. A total of 24 patients with CNS OIs and 16 non-CNS OIs (control) cases were selected. These AIDS patients were infected with HIV-1 by paid blood donors in China. HIV-1 loads in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected using RT-PCR, and the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from viral quasispecies isolated from CSF using nested PCR. The CSF HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was higher than that of non-CNS OIs, but plasma HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was not higher than that of non-CNS OIs. The nucleotide sequence of C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs had a high diversity, and the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs revealed R5 tropism as 11/25 charge rule. These results suggest that high levels of divergent HIV-1 quasispecies in the CNS probably contribute to opportunistic infections. "
833,0.001,1.0000,"Ex vivo effector cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity was assessed in 27 members of the Australian Long-Term Nonprogressor cohort and correlated with genetic, virological, and immunological markers. The 27 individuals were antiretroviral naive with CD4(+) T-cell counts of >500 cells/ microl for more than 8 years after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Effector CTL activity was determined using a standard ex vivo chromium release assay. Individuals with CTL activity (HIV-1 env(IIIB) or pol or gag) were then compared to those without CTL activity in relation to plasma HIV-1 RNA, ICD p24 antigen, beta(2)-microglobulin, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts, CCR5 and CCR2b genotypes, and progression to CD4 <500 cells/microl or commencement of antiretroviral treatment. Of the 27 individuals examined, 19 had no detectable effector CTL activity. The eight individuals with detectable CTL activity had significantly higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA (P = 0.014), immune complex dissociated p24 antigen (P = 0.006), and beta(2)-microglobulin (P = 0.009). There was increased risk of progression within 4 years of study entry in individuals with detectable effector CTL activity, higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA, higher beta(2)-microglobulin levels, and higher immune complex dissociated p24 antigen levels at enrollment (P = 0.017, P = 0.004, P = 0.027, P = 0.008 respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated viral load remained the strongest predictor of disease progression within this group (P = 0.017). There were no significant associations between CTL response and chemokine receptor genotype. These findings demonstrate the importance of HIV replication in generating an effector CTL response and show that effector CTL activity may be an early predictor of progression in people with long-term asymptomatic HIV infection."
4649,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. The mechanism of susceptibility to chronic persistent HBV infection is not well clarified, while the outcome of HBV infection mainly depends on the host immune response. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule is an integral component of the immune response on which majority of host genetic studies have concentrated. Many different HLA class II alleles have been demonstrated to play roles in HBV infection. In this study, the association between HBV infection and HLA-DRB1 alleles in Han individuals in northwestern China was studied for the first time. Two hundred and fifty Shaanxi Han individuals were categorized into three different groups: the HBV-infected patient group (n = 108), the spontaneously cleared control group (n = 108) and the unexposed group (n = 34). DRB1*04, DRB1*09, DRB1*12 and DRB1*15 were the most common genotypes in all the groups. The allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*03 [10.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 3.7% of spontaneously cleared controls, odds ratios (OR) = 3.10, Pc = 0.008, P < 0.05] and HLA-DRB1*07 (17.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 9.3% of spontaneously cleared controls, Pc = 0.016, OR = 2.09, P < 0.05) were markedly higher in the HBV-infected group. But the allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*15 (6.9% of HBV-infected patients vs 13.4% of spontaneously cleared controls Pc = 0.039, OR = 0.48, P < 0.05) were obviously lower than that of the spontaneously cleared controls. The above data indicate that HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*07 are related to susceptibility to chronic HBV infection, and DRB1*15 is negatively related to persistence to chronic HBV infection among people in northwestern China. Similar results were got for DRB1*03 and 15 alleles between the HBV-infected patients (n = 108) and 46 HBV seronegative spouses of the HBV patients, who were high-risk group for HBV infection. The above results suggest that host HLA class II gene is an important factor in determination of the outcome of HBV infection."
5763,0.001,1.0000,"The combination of antiretroviral (ARV) therapies introduced at the end of the 1990s profoundly changed the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Liver diseases are one of the three primary causes of 'non-AIDS-related' death in people living with HIV for three reasons: the high prevalence of hepatotropic viral co-infections, the hepatotoxicity of ARV drugs and new emerging liver diseases, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia and hepatitis E virus infection. The impact of HIV infection on the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV co-infection has markedly changed in the past few decades with the progress made in ARV treatment and the improved definition of therapeutic strategies for HCV or HBV. Initially, HIV had a negative impact on hepatotropic infections. Today, HIV does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of HCV and HBV infection. This is associated with fair immune restoration, viral suppression associated with analogues having dual activity against HBV and HIV and with the increasing efficacy of antiviral treatments against HCV. A significant decline is expected in the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic liver infection in co-infected patients. Nevertheless, today, there are three major issues: (i) improving preventive measures including vaccination and risk reduction; (ii) screening patients infected with HBV or HCV and evaluating the impact of chronic infection on the liver and finally; (iii) early screening of hepatocellular carcinoma whose occurrence is higher and that evolves more rapidly in co-infected than in mono-infected patients."
7284,0.001,1.0000,"Whereas new, or changes in existing, routes of transmission of HIV have not been identified in the 11 years since AIDS was identified as a clinical syndrome, changes in the epidemiology of HIV infection in the US have been identified during that period. The role of injection drug use as a risk for both parenteral and sexual transmission of HIV has increased substantially during this period. Heterosexual transmission is becoming more prominent as the epidemic continues to ""mature"" in the US. The likelihood that heterosexual transmission will become progressively more important in the spread of HIV in the US in the next several years seems high. The ability of individuals in some populations at risk for infection to modify risk behaviors has led to a reduction in transmission of HIV in those populations. The addition of nucleoside analog antiretrovirals and effective chemoprophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has led to increases in both the quality and duration of life for some populations of HIV-infected patients. Neither a chemotherapeutic cure nor a vaccine is on the immediate horizon; education and behavior modification remain the cornerstones of current prevention efforts. For a variety of complex reasons, inappropriate scrutiny has been focused on the remote risks of health-care provider-to-patient transmission of HIV. In the past 11 years medical science has made remarkable progress in understanding the etiology, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of HIV infection. Despite this progress, a great deal of work remains to be done not only in the medical and basic science arenas but also in the behavioural and sociological sciences."

Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
1636,0.001,1.0000,"CD4+ T cells are thought to contribute to antiviral immune responses by secretion of cytokines thereby providing help to CD8+ T and B cells. However, perforin-positive cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have been described in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients suggesting a role not only of CD8+ but also of CD4+ T cells for killing virus-infected cells. We investigated 76 patients with viral hepatitis [15 hepatitis B virus (HBV), 22 HBV/hepatitis D virus and 17 hepatitis C virus (HCV)] for cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. The frequency of perforin-positive CD4+ T cells in viral hepatitis was highly variable ranging from < 1% to more than 25%. Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells displayed the phenotype of terminally differentiated effector cells (CD28-, CD27-). The highest frequencies of CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were found in patients with delta hepatitis (P = 0.04 vs HBV and HCV patients), and the presence of CD4+ CTLs was associated with elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.01) and decreased platelet counts (P = 0.03). Perforin-positive CD4+ T cells decreased in two individuals during spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C. Significant associations were found between the frequency of perforin-expressing CD4+ cells and age (P = 0.04), perforin-positive CD8+ cells (P < 0.001) and perforin-positive CD4-/CD8- lymphoid cells (P = 0.002). Differentiated CD27- effector CD4+ CTLs can be detected in patients with viral hepatitis. In particular in patients with more advanced liver disease, the accumulation of perforin-positive T cells with age could be one correlate for the more severe course of viral hepatitis in elderly individuals."
6737,0.001,1.0000,"The Tat protein of HIV is produced early after infection and it is essential for viral replication and transmission. Tat is released by infected lymphocytes and is detected in the serum of HIV-infected patients. Extracellular Tat enters cells, where promotes HIV replication. Several studies suggest that humoral and cellular anti-Tat immunity have a protective role and may control disease progression. Of importance, Tat is conserved in its immunogenic regions among all viral subtypes except O subtype. Thus, the immunization with Tat cannot block virus entry but might block HIV replication and progression to disease. To test this hypothesis, monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were immunized with a biologically active Tat protein. Tat was non toxic and induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses. High titers of anti-Tat antibodies capable of neutralizing Tat activity and the in vitro infection with the SHIV89.6P, Tat-specific proliferation, CTLs, TNFalpha production and skin tests were detected in the vaccinated monkeys. Most importantly, upon challenge with the highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P (10 MID50, i.v.), 5/7 of the vaccinated monkeys showed no signs of infection nor CD4+-T cell decline over a 19 months of follow-up, whereas 3/3 controls were highly infected. Thus, a Tat-vaccine is capable of controlling the acute phase of infection in nonhuman primates. These data open new avenues for the development of an AIDS vaccine."

The frequency of HBsAg has been studied in sera of 732 consecutive patients who have glomerular diseases by using radioimmunoassay. The frequency of HBs antigenemia was 11.9%, which was not different from that in the general population of South Korea. Of the 87 HBsAg seropositive patients with GN, 29 cases with membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) and eighteen with membranous nephropathy (MN) were diagnosed as having HBV-associated nephropathy. Eighty-seven and one-half percent of the adults with MPGN and 80% of the children with MN were HBsAg carries. The morphologic findings and laboratory data in cases with HBV-associated MPGN and MN did not differ significantly from those observed in patients with MPGN and MN without circulating HBsAg. Yet mesangial deposits were more frequently noted in patients with HBV-associated MN when compared to others with idiopathic MN. Glomerular deposits of HBsAg were not detected using indirect immunofluorescence technique. Even though HBsAg was not demonstrable within the glomeruli, HBV infection seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of MPGN in Korean adults and MN in children."
1434,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "

Strict adherence to the universal infection control precautions has been deemed adequate to prevent nosocomial transmission of HCV. Subsequently, however, select isolation measures, such as the clustering of HCV positive patients in a defined sector of the unit, have been adopted, specially for those units with a high HCV prevalence and when the personnel-patient ratio was such that it could involuntary favor the break of the universal precautions. In this Multicenter Spanish Study on HCV in Dialysis, the importance of both time and isolation measures led to a decrease of HCV prevalence. Time was the most important factor (although interacting with the isolation measures) and was independent of the initial HCV prevalence."

We describe the history of a 38-year-old HIV-positive female patient who developed fulminant hepatic failure of an autoimmune etiology with rapid deterioration of her clinical status and secondary multiorgan failure and, therefore, needed emergency liver transplantation (LT) as a lifesaving procedure. Because of the scarcity of organs and the high mortality rate for emergency status patients on the LT waiting list, we decided to accept a Chagas disease-seropositive deceased donor liver graft for this immunocompromised Chagas disease-seronegative patient. The recipient had a rapid postoperative recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 9 without prophylactic treatment for Chagas disease. Fifteen months after LT, she was still alive and had never experienced seroconversion on periodic screening tests for Chagas detection. Although there is an inherent risk of acute Chagas disease developing in seronegative recipients, our report suggests that these infected organs can be safely used as a lifesaving strategy for HIV patients with a high need for LT."

Twenty-eight hemophiliacs were followed for up to 9 years after seroconversion. In addition, 13 seropositive patients who elected to receive (high purity) factor VIII concentrate for up to 1.5 years were compared to a contemporaneous concurrent control group of 8 seropositive patients treated with intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate, and then both groups were followed for an additional 1.5 years while receiving zidovudine. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) developed in 9 of 28 patients (33%) from 1 to 9 years following seroconversion. CD4 cell count declined at a rate of 13.5% per year for the cohort but for persons 25 years and above the rate was significantly higher (17.5 +/- 9.2% per year vs. 9.5 +/- 4.7%, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.05) than in those under 25. All three patients who had undergone splenectomy developed AIDS. Subjects treated with high purity concentrates, with the exception of one patient who developed the nephrotic syndrome secondary to amyloidosis, had stable CD4 cell counts. On the other hand, all patients receiving intermediate purity concentrates had a decline in CD4 cells, and the difference from initial levels was highly significant (p = 0.01).

Several case reports have also noted some AIDS-associated lesions among persons with hemophilia, but the prevalence of these lesions in hemophilia populations is not known. This study investigated the prevalence of oral and perioral lesions in a cohort of patients receiving care at a hemophilia treatment center. In a sample of 32 patients with a factor VIII deficiency and 5 patients with a factor IX deficiency who underwent oral examinations, more than 80% were HIV seropositive. Cervical lymphadenopathy was present in more than half of the patients who were HIV seropositive but was absent in those who were HIV seronegative. Intraoral AIDS-associated lesions were present only in patients for whom a diagnosis of AIDS had been made, indicating that oral lesions among persons with hemophilia who are HIV seropositive may be less prevalent than among homosexual males or intravenous drug abusers who are HIV seropositive."

The prevalence of seropositivity to HIV was 29.4%, while that of AIDS was 6.7%. Eight of the seropositive subjects were women. The average age on entrance into the Program was 28.7 +/- 7.9, and it was significantly higher among the seropositive subjects. The study sample was divided into four subgroups: women, bisexual men, homosexual men, and heterosexual men. In all the subgroups the prevalence of high-risk sexual practices was high and the percentage of condom utilization was low. Frequency of exposure to different risk factors, such as injections, transfusions of blood or other fluids, surgical interventions, tattoos, consumption of alcohol and other psychoactive substances, acupuncture, and sexual preference and practices, was determined. HIV seropositivity for the group as a whole was associated with sexual relations with infected persons (OR = 3.96), active anal coitus (OR = 3.81), sexual relations with men (OR = 3.69), passive anal coitus (OR = 3.35), and sexual relations abroad (OR = 2.24). In men, HIV seropositivity was associated with anal coitus (OR = 4.0), homosexual relations (OR = 3.96), sexual relations with infected persons (OR = 3.75), and sexual relations abroad (OR = 1.88); in women there was an association with intravenous drug use (chi 2 = 10.72) and with sexual relations abroad (OR = 12.67)."
8187,0.001,1.0000,"We examined the prevalence and correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) risk behaviors in a large sample of severely mentally ill (SMI) patients. Risk levels were correlated with demographic factors, diagnosis, symptom severity, trauma history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder (SUD), and sexual orientation. SMI clients from urban and rural settings (N = 275) were assessed regarding HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and hypothesized risk factors. Patients exhibited substantial levels of risky behavior, particularly sexual risk. Correlates of increased risk included SUD, trauma, male homosexual orientation, younger age, and symptom severity. Structural equation modeling identified SUD and sexual orientation as the primary determinants of both drug and sexual risk behavior. We conclude that specific illness related variables appear to have less impact on risk behavior among people with SMI than previously hypothesized. Substance abuse prevention and treatment may be the most effective means of reducing HIV risk in this population."

Sixty-five HIV-negative and 164 HIV-positive men participated. A suicidal ideation score was derived from using five items selected from the Beck Depression Inventory and the General Health Questionnaire (28-item version). Lifetime and current prevalence rates of psychiatric disorder were evaluated with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule Version-III-R. The HIV-positive (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Stage IV) men (n = 85) had significantly higher total suicidal ideation scores than the asymptomatic HIV-positive men (CDC Stage II/III) (n = 79) and the HIV-negative men. High rates of past suicide attempt were detected in the HIV-negative (29%) and HIV-positive men (21%). Factors associated with suicidal ideation included being HIV-positive, the presence of current psychiatric disorder, higher neuroticism scores, external locus of control, and current unemployment. In the HIV-positive group analyzed separately, higher suicidal ideation was discriminated by the adjustment to HIV diagnosis (greater hopelessness and lower fighting spirit), disease factors (greater number of current acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]-related conditions), and background variables (neuroticism). Significant predictors of a past attempted suicide were a positive lifetime history of psychiatric disorder (particularly depression diagnoses), a lifetime history of infection drug use, and a family history of suicide attempts. The findings indicate increased levels of suicidal ideation in symptomatic HIV-positive men and highlight the role that multiple psychosocial factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempted suicide play in this population."

On the other hand, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is also of known burden. Determining prevalence measures of these viruses is crucial for establishing appropriate country specific strategies regarding prevention, diagnosis, and containment. This systematic review was aimed to provide pooled seroprevalence estimates of the three viruses in Sudan. Structured review of the literature was conducted to obtain relevant studies published in both national and international databases. After assessment of quality and bias in all proposed studies, 57 prevalence studies were included. Meta-analysis was conducted for all studies and subgroup analysis was also approached. The total sample size of participants in included studies providing HIV antibodies prevalence was 15,479. Based on information retrieved from these studies, HIV prevalence ranged from 0 to 18.3% among different study populations. However, pooled prevalence estimate for HIV antibodies was 1%. Kassala, Eastern Sudan was the most endemic State (4.18%). The HBV reported seroprevalence rates ranged from 5.1 up to 26.81% among different populations and the overall pooled prevalence was 12.07%. For HCV antibodies; 2.74% was determined to be the pooled prevalence. Khartoum State was the most endemic State of both HBV and HCV with seroprevalence of 12.69% and 6.78%, respectively.Based on data reviewed and synthesized; there is no evidence for an HIV endemic in the general population of Sudan. However, both HBV and HCV seroprevalence rates are indicating otherwise. Reducing the overall burden of HIV, HBV and HCV infections will require new measures and national strategies and the recognition of the infections as one of the country's priority issues."

They were also interviewed with regard to their past history of blood transfusion, vaccination against HBV, liver diseases and repeated skin piercing treatments such as tattooing, acupuncture and intravenous drug use. Sera from 300 female blood donors (aged 20 s-40 s), of the same district, collected during the same year, were assessed for comparison. Incidence of seropositives for anti-HCV and anti-TP were found to be significantly high in the prostitute group (11.0% and 16.2%, respectively) compared to the control (0% for both). Anti-HBV seropositives were 14.1% in the prostitute group and 12.7% in the control group without significant difference and none of our subjects were found to be anti-HIV positive. Among HCV infected only 5 experienced repeated skin-piercing treatment and none underwent blood transfusion.

Medicaid pharmacy claims data were used for analyses. To examine the association between treatment group and medication adherence, three types of multivariate regressions were employed. In addition, all regressions were conducted for the whole population using data from 1995 to 2001 as well as a subpopulation, which excluded data prior to September 1997. Model covariates included patient characteristics, healthcare utilization, and non-study antiretroviral therapy use. The likelihood of > or =95% adherence among patients on combination therapy was three times greater than patients taking 3TC and ZDV in separate pills. Also, combination therapy patients had on average 1.4 fewer adherence failures per year of follow-up and nearly double the time to adherence failure compared to the separate pills group. Consistency among study results suggests that fixed dose combination therapies such as lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg/ zidovudine (ZDV) 300 mg should be considered when prescribing HIV treatment that includes an appropriate dual nucleoside."

Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."

This quality improvement project aimed to develop and test a nurse-driven evidence-based pathway that supports the care of patients receiving hepatitis C medication therapy in a tertiary, academic hepatology practice. All adult patients, 18 years and older, who were started on HCV treatment from January 20 to February 15, 2011, were included in the testing of a nurse-driven HCV pathway for the first 12 weeks of treatment. The majority of the patients treated were male (71.8% prepathway and 83.3% postpathway), of White ethnic background (61.5% prepathway and 58.3% postpathway), genotype 1 (69% prepathway and 91.7% postpathway), and had comorbid conditions classified as ""other"" (38.5% prepathway and 33.3% postpathway). As for treatment status, the majority of the patients were ""treatment naive"" in prepathway or had never received prior HCV treatment (59.0%) or ""had recurrent HCV after liver transplantation"" (41.7%). The 4-week treatment completion rate was 94.9% for the prepathway group and 100.0% for the postpathway group; 12-week completion rate was 87.2% (prepathway) and 58.3% for the postpathway group. The mean 4-week adherence score for the prepathway group was 2.46 and the postpathway group was 2.92.

In this study, to estimate the annual rate of direct liver fibrosis progression, we used analyses of paired biopsy samples from HIV/HCV-coinfected patients without prior treatment of hepatitis and assessed the possible association of fibrosis progression with certain clinical variables. We evaluated 30 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with no history of prior treatment of hepatitis C, who underwent paired liver biopsies. All patients were under antiretroviral therapy at first and second biopsies. The average annual progression rate was 0.13 fibrosis unit/year, with 36.7% of patients defined as progressors. Liver fibrosis progression was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P < .0340) levels over 3 times the upper limit of normal present at first biopsy. Elevated ALT and AST levels appear to be associated with more accelerated liver fibrosis progression among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. "

We intensively studied viral replication in macaques receiving identical inocula of SIV. Marked differences in viral replication patterns were apparent within the first week following inoculation, a time prior to the development of measurable specific immune effector responses to viral antigens. Plasma viral RNA levels measured on day 7 postinoculation correlated with levels measured in the postacute phase of infection. Differences in the susceptibility of host cells from different animals to in vitro SIV infection correlated with the permissiveness of the animals for early in vivo viral replication and hence with the postacute set point level of plasma viremia. These results suggest that host factors that exert their effects prior to full development of specific immune responses are critical in establishing the in vivo viral replication pattern and associated clinical course in subjects infected with SIV and, by extension, with HIV-1."
8753,0.001,1.0000,"An association of increased weight with a slower progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been reported in studies that have not included large numbers of women. We evaluated the association of HIV disease progression with body mass index (BMI) in 871 women and present cross-sectional, survival, and longitudinal analyses. A higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower rate of occurrence of the first CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3). In analyses that incorporated time-varying BMI, underweight and normal women had an increased risk of clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and underweight women had increased risk of HIV-related death, compared with obese women. The association between change in BMI and CD4 cell count was estimated; increases in BMI were associated with slight increases in CD4 cell counts, even after controlling for prior values of CD4 cell count, viral load, and treatment. Higher BMI and increases in BMI are associated with a decreased risk of HIV progression."
8878,0.001,1.0000,"Defective regulatory components of the immune system seem to contribute to HIV disease progression. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was reported to restore malfunctioning immunologic regulatory components. To corroborate this hypothesis, we studied different dendritic-cell (DC) and T-cell subsets with regulatory phenotype in 41 clinically stable patients with hemophilia more than 25 years after infection with HIV and 10 years after initiation of HAART. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed normal DC1 and DC2 levels, increased CD8 peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) counts and T helper (Th) 2 proportions, and decreased Th1, CD3CD4CD127, and CD3CD8CD127 PBL proportions. High viral load was associated with high DC1, whereas high CD8 PBL counts were associated with low DC2. CD3CD4CD25Foxp3 (regulatory T [Treg] cell) and CD3CD8CD28Foxp3 PBL counts (suppressor T [Ts] cell) exhibited normal levels in patients with undetectable retroviral load, were increased in parallel to retroviral load, and were associated with low CD8 T lymphocytes and low CD19 B lymphocytes. Normal or even increased levels of DCs and normal or even increased levels of PBL with a Treg or Ts phenotype that coincide with viral load increases and CD8 T- and CD19 B-lymphocyte decreases suggest a functioning immunoregulatory system that reacts to HIV replication. Increased CD8 PBL counts imply immunocompetence. Increased CD8 PBL counts and normal or even upregulated immunoregulatory cells might stabilize our long-term HIV-infected patients with hemophilia clinically."
7786,0.001,1.0000,"To provide additional information on the acquisition of host cell membrane proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced by natural cellular reservoirs, two different field isolates were used to infect ex vivo expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human lymphoid tissue histocultures. The insertion of host-derived HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40, CD40L, and CD86 within HIV-1 particles was evaluated by using specific antibodies linked to a solid matrix to capture ultrafiltrated viral progeny. Overall, our data indicate that neither the HIV-1 co-receptor usage (i.e., T-tropic or macrophage-tropic) nor the cellular source of HIV-1 has an impact on the incorporation process but it was found to be under the influence of the donor source. Given that most viral replication is thought to occur in lymphoid tissues and previous works have shown that HIV-1 life cycle is affected by several virus-anchored host proteins, our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection."
2228,0.001,1.0000,"Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles produced by healthy and virus-infected cells. Exosomes derived from infected cells have been shown to contain viral microRNAs (miRNAs). HIV-1 encodes its own miRNAs that regulate viral and host gene expression. The most abundant HIV-1-derived miRNA, first reported by us and later by others using deep sequencing, is the trans-activation response element (TAR) miRNA. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of TAR RNA in exosomes from cell culture supernatants of HIV-1-infected cells and patient sera. TAR miRNA was not in Ago2 complexes outside the exosomes but enclosed within the exosomes. We detected the host miRNA machinery proteins Dicer and Drosha in exosomes from infected cells. We report that transport of TAR RNA from the nucleus into exosomes is a CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance 1)-dependent active process. Prior exposure of naive cells to exosomes from infected cells increased susceptibility of the recipient cells to HIV-1 infection. Exosomal TAR RNA down-regulated apoptosis by lowering Bim and Cdk9 proteins in recipient cells. We found 10(4)-10(6) copies/ml TAR RNA in exosomes derived from infected culture supernatants and 10(3) copies/ml TAR RNA in the serum exosomes of highly active antiretroviral therapy-treated patients or long term nonprogressors. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated that HIV-1-infected cells produced exosomes that are uniquely characterized by their proteomic and RNA profiles that may contribute to disease pathology in AIDS.

3124,0.001,1.0000,"The Hepatitis C virus has emerged over the last two decades as the cause of the second greatest viral infection epidemic after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A significant characteristic of the infection with the Hepatitis C virus is the variable course of its natural history. About 80% of the people who acquire this agent develop a chronic infection, with varying degree of liver damage, including cirrhosis and even hepatocelular carcinoma. However, only a minority progresses towards more severe forms. Several factors associated with the host seem to influence the progression of Hepatitis C into cirrhosis. The most important are alcohol abuse, the age in which the infection is acquired, duration of the infection, overweight, male sex and coinfection with Hepatitis A or B or HIV. Evidence of the role of iron levels in the liver, tobacco or the source of infection are less clear. The factors associated with the agent do not seem to play any role in the progression of the disease. Additional studies with adequate control groups are required to confirm the participation of the above mentioned host factors and to identify others which could influence the natural history of the Hepatitis C infection. A reduction in the ingestion of alcohol, overweight and tobacco consumption could contribute to the treatment of HVC chronic infection, as well as vaccination against Hepatitis A and B."
889,0.001,1.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09-0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02-7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations. "
4910,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-infection have a high prevalence of abnormal bone metabolism and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D treatment has some benefit in patients with HIV infection. In this paper, we review the evidence for an association between vitamin D and HIV infection. Literature search was done from Medline. Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to HIV pathology [i.e., the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, cytochrome P(450), renin-angiotensin system, apoli-poprotein E, liver X receptor, toll-like receptor, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1, and the Sp1 promoter gene]. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on HIV through nongenomic factors, i.e., ultraviolet radiation exposure, matrix metalloproteinase, heme oxygenase-1, the prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase-2, and oxidative stress. In conclusion, vitamin D may have a beneficial role in HIV. Calcitriol, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 should be tested in HIV-infected population because of its active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Further investigation with calcitriol in HIV is needed."
3136,0.001,1.0000,"Knowledge is limited regarding decision-making about antiretroviral treatment (ART) from the patient's perspective. This substudy of a longitudinal study of psychobiologic aspects of long-term survival, conducted in 2003, compares the rationales of HIV-positive individuals (n = 79) deciding to take or not to take ART. Inclusion criteria were HIV/AIDS symptoms, or CD4 nadir less than 350, or viral load greater than 55,000. Those not meeting any criteria for receiving ART (2/2003 U.S. DHHS treatment guidelines) were excluded. Diagnosis was on average 11 years ago; 36% were female, 42% African American, 28% Latino, 24% white, and 6% other. Qualitative content analysis of semistructured interviews identified 10 criteria for the decision to take or not to take ART: CD4/viral load counts (87%), quality of life (85%), knowledge/ beliefs about resistance (66%), mind-body beliefs (65%), adverse effects of ART (59%), easy-to-take regimen (58%), spirituality/worldview (58%), drug resistance (41%), experience of HIV/AIDS symptoms (39%), and preference for complementary/alternative medicine (17%). Participants choosing not to take ART (27%) preferred complementary/alternative medicine (r = 0.43, p = 0.001)1, perceived a better quality of life without ART (r = 0.32, p < 0.004), and weighted avoidance of adverse effects of ART more heavily (r = 0.24, p < 0.030) than participants taking ART (73%). Demographic characteristics related to taking ART were having a partner (r = 0.31, p < 0.008) and having health insurance (r = 0.26, p< 0.040). Decisions to take or not to take ART depend not only on patient medical characteristics, but also on individual beliefs about ART, complementary/alternative medicine, spirituality, and mind-body connection. HIV-positive individuals declining treatment place more weight on alternative medicine, avoiding adverse effects and perceiving a better quality of life through not taking ART."
9145,0.001,1.0000,"A subset of women in the Pumwani Sex Worker Cohort, established in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya, remains uninfected despite repeated high-risk exposure (HIV-exposed, seronegative [HESN]) through active sex work. This HESN phenotype is associated with several alleles of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses to HIV-1. The associations of HLA alleles with differential HIV-1 infection are most likely due to their different abilities to present antigen and the different immune responses they induce. The characteristics of epitopes of HLA alleles associated with different outcomes of HIV-1 infection might therefore point to a vital clue for developing an effective vaccine. In this study, we systematically analyzed HIV-1 clade A and D Gag CD8(+) T cell epitopes of two HLA class I alleles associated with different outcomes of HIV-1 infection. Binding affinity and off-rates of the identified epitopes were determined. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays with patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) validated the epitopes. Epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were further phenotyped for memory markers with tetramer staining. Our study showed that the protective allele A*01:01 recognizes only three Gag epitopes. By contrast, B*07:02, the allele associated with susceptibility, binds 30 epitope variants. These two alleles differ most importantly in the spectrum of Gag epitopes they can present and not in affinity, off-rates, the location of the epitopes, or epitope-specific Tem/Tcm frequencies. The binding of more epitopes and strong IFN-gamma ELISpot responses are associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, while more focused antigen recognition of multiple subtypes is protective. Rational vaccine design should take these observations into account."
5564,0.001,1.0000,"Adolescent Impact, a developmentally targeted behavioral intervention aimed at decreasing risk behaviors and promoting health care adherence, was delivered to 83 HIV-infected youth, aged 13-21 years, receiving care in five urban HIV centers. Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."
3733,0.001,1.0000,"Despite China's free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, there are high rates of treatment failure, large sociodemographic disparities in care outcomes and emerging medication resistance. Understanding patient medication adherence behaviors and challenges could inform adherence interventions to maximize the individual and prevention benefits of ART. This study assessed recent nonadherence and treatment interruption among 813 HIV-infected adult outpatients in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed a behavioral survey, underwent chart review, and were tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Factors associated with suboptimal adherence were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 721 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 18.9% reported recent nonadherence (any missed ART in the past four weeks) and 6.8% reported treatment interruption (four or more weeks of missed ART in the past year). Lower education, living alone, alcohol use, and being on ART one to three years were associated with recent nonadherence. Male gender, lower education, and being on ART one to three years were associated with treatment interruption. ART medication adherence interventions are needed in China that include individualized, long-term adherence plans sensitive to patients' educational and economic situations. These interventions should also consider possible gender disparities in treatment outcomes and address the use of alcohol during ART. Successful ART medication adherence interventions in China can inform other international settings that face similar adherence challenges and disparities."
2941,0.001,1.0000,"The definition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) immunogenic epitopes is central to the rational design of AIDS vaccine strategies. In this study, we have generated seven HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones from the peripheral blood of two seropositive subjects. Epitopes recognized by these CTL clones were identified by using target cells infected with recombinant HIV-1-vaccinia virus vectors expressing truncated reverse transcriptase proteins and further defined by using target cells incubated with overlapping 25-amino acid synthetic reverse transcriptase peptides. Five different CTL epitopes were identified, and in each case recognition was restricted by class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Clones maintained specific cytolytic function in continuous culture for up to 11 months, requiring only periodic restimulation with a CD3-specific monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that HIV-1-specific, major histocompatibility class I-restricted CTL recognize multiple epitopes of a single viral gene product in conjunction with different host HLA antigens. In addition, they demonstrate that human virus-specific CTL can be grown in long-term culture without the need for reexposure to viral antigen."
8196,0.001,1.0000,"Association between isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been noted in HIV-infected individuals. This study describes the frequency of isolated anti-HBc and its possible value for the detection of HBV-DNA in HIV-infected patients with or without HCV co-infection. Ninety-two HIV-infected patients were enrolled in the study. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV, HIV viral load and CD4 count were tested in all subjects. Then we compared 63 subjects with HIV-HCV co-infection with 29 subjects with HIV infection alone regarding isolated anti-HBc (HBs Ag negative, anti-HBs negative and anti-HBc positive). The presence of HBV-DNA was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction in serum samples of patients with isolated anti-HBc. Of 63 anti-HCV-positive patients, 18 subjects (28.6%, 95% [confidence interval] CI: 22.6-34.6%), and of 29 anti-HCV-negative patients, five subjects (17.2%, 95% CI: 11.5-22.9%) had isolated anti-HBc. HBV-DNA was detectable in three of 18 anti-HCV-positive patients (16.7%, 95% CI: 9.7-23.7%) and none of the anti-HCV-negative patients with isolated anti-HBc. Our study showed that individuals co-infected with HIV and HCV were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than subjects with HIV alone. This investigation also demonstrates that the presence of isolated anti-HBc in HIV-HCV-infected individuals may reflect occult HBV infection in these patients."
2704,0.001,1.0000,"For some patient subgroups, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with worse outcomes after kidney transplantation (KT); potentially modifiable factors may be responsible. The study goal was to identify factors that predict a higher risk of graft loss among HIV-positive KT recipients compared with a similar transplant among HIV-negative recipients. In this study, 82 762 deceased donor KT recipients (HIV positive: 526; HIV negative: 82 236) reported to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) (2001-2013) were studied by interaction term analysis. Compared to HIV-negative recipients, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) amplified risk 2.72-fold among HIV-positive KT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.75-4.22, p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the excess risk was attributable to the interaction between HIV and HCV (attributable proportion of risk due to the interaction [AP]: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23-0.63, p = 0.02). Among HIV-positive recipients with more than three HLA mismatches (MMs), risk was amplified 1.80-fold compared to HIV-negative (aHR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.31-2.47, p < 0.001); 42% of the excess risk was attributable to the interaction between HIV and more than three HLA MMs (AP: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.60, p = 0.01). High-HIV-risk (HIV-positive/HCV-positive HLAwith more than three MMs) recipients had a 3.86-fold increased risk compared to low-HIV-risk (HIV-positive/HCV-negative HLA with three or fewer MMs)) recipients (aHR: 3.86, 95% CI: 2.37-6.30, p < 0.001). Avoidance of more than three HLA MMs in HIV-positive KT recipients, particularly among coinfected patients, may mitigate the increased risk of graft loss associated with HIV infection."

Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5966,0.001,1.0000,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."

We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."
6503,0.001,1.0000,"Since the middle of 1987, fewer consistently defined AIDS cases have been reported than expected among homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. This ""AIDS deficit"" was greater among homosexual and bisexual men in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but was also striking among all homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. Deficits were virtually absent among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States. Three independent sources of data--placebo-controlled trials, pharmaceutical company reports, and the San Francisco Men's Health Study--were used to demonstrate that the amounts of zidovudine (AZT) given prophylactically to those at highest risk of AIDS since March 1987 have been sufficient to account for most of the observed AIDS deficits. Other advances in the medical care of pre-AIDS patients may have combined with AZT to produce the deficits. Other hypothesized explanations were examined and found insufficient to account for the observed AIDS deficits, including: (a) a sudden halt in new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections during the early or mid-1980s; (b) misspecification of the distribution of AIDS incubation times following HIV infection; (c) increasing delays in the reporting of AIDS cases; (d) changes in the surveillance definition of AIDS in 1987; and (e) evolution of attenuated HIV strains. The hypothesis that therapy is affecting national AIDS rates has important implications. Failure to take the effects of therapy into account can lead to serious underestimates by back-calculation of the cumulative numbers infected with HIV and of AIDS incidence over the longer term. Moreover, it appears that AIDS incidence could be retarded in underserved groups, such as IVDUs, by making AZT and other state-of-the-art treatments readily available to AIDS-free patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
3616,0.001,1.0000,"Bacterial respiratory tract infections occur frequently in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and may be caused by a wide variety of pathogens. Pneumonia is the most commonly diagnosed respiratory infection in HIV-infected persons and is more common in those persons than in non-HIV-infected ones. HIV-infected persons have a much higher risk of pneumococcal disease than do noninfected controls, and disease may occur relatively early in the course of HIV infection. While mortality associated with the disease does not seem to be high among HIV-infected persons, there is a higher rate of recurrence of the disease in that population. Risk factors for pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected persons are not well characterized. Though efficacy data are limited, the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for use early in the course of HIV infection. There are no data suggesting that HIV-infected persons should be revaccinated routinely. Antiretroviral agents may enhance the immunologic response to the polysaccharide vaccine. Prophylactic antibiotics may have a role in preventing recurrences of severe bacterial respiratory infections, and intravenous immunoglobulin may be useful in preventing serious bacterial infections in HIV-infected children. HIV-infected persons are also at greater risk for serious infections with Haemophilus influenzae than are non-HIV-infected persons. Vaccination against H. influenzae type b (Hib) is recommended for HIV-infected children but not for adults. Antimicrobial drug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae have become more prevalent recently and consequently have impacted on strategies for prevention and treatment of those infections."
6273,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate the relationships among cytomegalovirus infection, sexual behavior, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, and indexes of cellular immunity, 180 homosexual men and 26 heterosexual men were studied. Among the homosexual men, cytomegalovirus seropositivity was associated with increased T8 lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) and reduced T4/T8 ratios (p = 0.006); these results were independent of HIV infection. Cytomegalovirus seropositivity was also associated with increasing age, numbers of sexual partners, and the practice of anal-receptive intercourse. At the first visit, cytomegalovirus was isolated from none of 13 cytomegalovirus-seropositive heterosexual subjects, compared with 62 (36 percent) of 171 seropositive homosexual men (p less than 0.005). Viral isolation was most common from semen. Among 32 cytomegalovirus-seropositive homosexual subjects from whom culture specimens were obtained more than four times over 10 to 30 months, 72 percent of the specimens were culture-positive. The mean duration of cytomegalovirus excretion in semen was 22 months, and in urine, the duration was nine months. Cytomegalovirus excretion was associated with younger age and reduced lymphocyte proliferation in response to cytomegalovirus, but not with antibody to HIV. Cytomegalovirus infection is sexually transmitted among homosexual men, perhaps by rectal intercourse, and is associated with alterations in T lymphocyte subsets. Most seropositive homosexual men excrete cytomegalovirus intermittently, primarily in the semen."

Prevalence and mean viral load were not affected by postnatal ages or maternal vitamin A supplementation. Among study subjects with multiple samples, breast milk viral load did not change at different postnatal ages. Breast milk viral load correlated positively with plasma viral load (r = 0.47; p =.005) and negatively with maternal CD4 count at entry to the study (r = -0.26; p =.02). Mothers of HIV-infected children had a higher proportion of detectable HIV RNA in their breast milk than mothers of uninfected children (p =.03) and higher mean log10 HIV RNA quantities (p =.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, log10 HIV RNA quantity in breast milk was significantly associated with the risk of mother-child transmission (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-6.51). Thus, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and of mastitis and early weaning may be important elements of a public health policy that is relevant to women in developing countries with HIV infection. Where available, antiretrovirals may also have an impact on opportunistic infections and mastitis."
4574,0.001,1.0000,"Optimal testing strategies for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection and the administration of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) remain uncertain among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A 4-year prospective study was conducted among Thai HIV-infected patients who underwent simultaneous tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube Test (QFT-IT) at care entry. Based on baseline test results, patients were categorized into the following 4 groups: i) QFT-IT-positive, TST-reactive; ii) QFT-IT-positive, TST-non-reactive; iii) QFT-IT-negative, TST-reactive; and iv) QFT-IT-negative, TST-non-reactive. The QFT-IT-positive patients were offered 9-month IPT and were QFT-IT tested annually. Of the 150 enrolled patients, 8, 12, 16, and 114 patients were assigned to groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Sixteen of 19 QFT-IT-positive patients (84%) completed IPT. The incidence of tuberculosis was significantly higher in patients who declined IPT than in those underwent treatment (11.11 vs. 0 case/100 patient-year; P ＜ 0.001). Among the 16 patients completing IPT, 11 (69%) and 2 (12%) had QFT-IT reversion at 1 and 2 years after IPT, respectively. The remaining 3 (19%) did not demonstrate any reversion, and their baseline interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels were above 1.2 IU/mL. Initial QFT-IT-guided IPT was effective in preventing tuberculosis. Serial QFT-IT for evaluating IPT effectiveness had limitations because of delayed or lack of reversion, especially for patients with high baseline IFN-γ levels."
3952,0.001,1.0000,"A number of clinical trials have explored the optimal dosage for antiretroviral therapy and, in various ways, the optimal time, in terms of stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, at which treatment should begin. Some studies have shown that treatment with zidovudine results in a delay in progression to more advanced stages of HIV disease, and that the benefits are more durable among persons who started zidovudine with higher CD4+ cell counts. Efficacy is preserved and toxicity is reduced when zidovudine is used at dosages lower than those originally recommended. The Concorde study found that administration of zidovudine to asymptomatic persons was associated with increases in CD4+ cell counts and improvement in delaying disease progression at 55 weeks, but found no correlation between time of initiation of therapy and either longer-term delay in onset of symptomatic disease or ultimate survival. The analysis of these results, however, is complicated because of premature crossover of study participants from deferred treatment to immediate treatment. The consensus of the discussants of these studies is that antiretroviral treatment should be initiated by the time the CD4+ cell count has fallen to 200-500 cells/mm3. Although recognizing that, in general, viral infections call for treatment, the panelists were divided in their opinions about treatment of asymptomatic patients with CD4+ cell counts > 500/mm3."

A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to February 2015 in 67 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) patients. Blood collected from these patients was used to perform cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) lymphocyte blood counts and a white blood cell count, as well as to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) blood by flow cytometry and perform optical and immuno-turbidimetric detection. Enteric bacteria were isolated from the stool of patients, and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the main pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tracts of HIV+ (85.3%) and HIV- (81.1%) patients, and infections with Klebsiella sp. were also predominant among HIV- patients (29.4%). Resistance of Klebsiella sp. to ceftriaxone (CRO; P=0.001), gentamicin (GEN; P=0.005), chloramphenicol (CHL; P=0.0004), ciprofloxacin (CIP; P=0.005) and doxycycline (DOX; P<0.0001) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Enterobacter sp. showed high resistance to GEN (P=0.009) and CIP (P=0.001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Citrobacter sp. was resistant to GEN (P=0.009) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Salmonella sp. showed high resistance to CHL (P<0.0001) and DOX (P<0.0001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Resistance of Serratia sp. to AMO (P=0.005), AMC (P=0.005) and CHL (P=0.005) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Lymphopenia was higher in HIV+ patients (36.8%) than in HIV- patients (2.7%). In 45.9% of the HIV- patients, the CRP rate was higher than 6mg/L compared to 16.2% in HIV+ patients. In general, bacterial multi-drug resistance in HIV+ patients (79.4%) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than in HIV- patients (29.7%). The present study revealed that the resistance profiles of bacteria should be considered in HIV-infected patients to improve their health care."
1668,0.001,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) PreS mutations C1653T, T1753V, and A1762T/G1764A were reported as a strong risk factor of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a meta-analysis. HBV core promoter overlaps partially with HBx coding sequence, so the nucleotide 1762 and 1764 mutations induce HBV X protein (HBx) 130 and 131 substitutions. We sought to elucidate the impact of HBx mutations on HCC development. Chronically HBV-infected patients were enrolled in this study: 42 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 23 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 31 HCC patients. Direct sequencing showed HBx131, HBx130, HBx5, HBx94, and HBx38 amino acid mutations were common in HCC patients. Of various mutations, HBx130+HBx131 (double) mutations and HBx5+HBx130+HBx131 (triple) mutations were significantly high in HCC patients. Double and triple mutations increased the risk for HCC by 3.75-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.101 to 12.768, P = 0.033) and 5.34-fold (95% CI = 1.65 to 17.309, P = 0.005), respectively, when HCC patients were compared to CHB patients. Functionally, there were significantly higher levels of NF-κB activity in cells with the HBx5 mutant and with the double mutants than that of wild-type cells and the triple-mutant cells. The triple mutation did not increase NF-κB activity. Other regulatory pathways seem to exist for NF-κB activation. In conclusion, a specific HBx mutation may contribute to HCC development by activating NF-κB activity. The HBx5 mutation in genotype C2 HBV appears to be a risk factor for the development of HCC and may be used to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection."
147,0.001,1.0000,"Factors associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA breakthrough and the significance of YMDD variants without the presence of wild-type YMDD during prolonged lamivudine treatment are unknown. We studied the amino acid sequence of codon 552 (YMDD motif) and codon 528 by means of a line probe assay in 159 chronic HBV patients (median follow-up 29.6 months). Pretreatment HBV DNA levels and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels correlated inversely with the time to HBV DNA breakthrough with YMDD variants (r = -0.46, P =.001; r = -0.45, P =.001 respectively). Patients harboring YMDD variants 3 months before HBV DNA breakthroughs had higher HBV DNA breakthrough levels compared with those without YMDD variants 3 months before HBV DNA breakthroughs (18.9 x 10(6) vs. 5.4 x 10(6) copies/mL, P =.007). Patients with HBV DNA breakthroughs had higher percentages of YMDD variants without the presence of wild-type YMDD compared with patients without HBV DNA breakthrough (25.6% vs. 9%, P =.007 for single M552I variant; 20.9% vs. 8.1%, P =.026 for single M552V variant; 30.2% vs. 9.9%, P =.004 for M552I/M552V variants). Patients with HBV DNA levels of more than 10(3) copies/mL after 6 months of lamivudine therapy had a 63.2% chance of subsequently developing YMDD variants. HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 2 patients after the emergence of YMDD variants. Only one patient developed YMDD variant after HBeAg seroconversion. There was no increase in the rate of development of YMDD variants or L528M mutation in patients receiving lamivudine 25 mg daily or famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day before being given lamivudine 100 mg daily."
1127,0.001,1.0000,"The HIV epidemic in Vietnam is concentrated, with high prevalence estimates among injection drug users and commercial sex workers. Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
9592,0.001,1.0000,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been identified as cofactors of HIV transmission. Greater understanding of local STI burdens can assist in the development of more effective STI and HIV prevention strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of STIs among South Indian men and women identified to be at increased risk for HIV infection. Individuals at increased risk for HIV infection were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study in Chennai, India (n = 480) between August 2002 and December 2003. Participants were enrolled from patients seeking services at an sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and a confidential HIV testing and counseling program. The most common prevalent STIs were herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 (50% of women, 29% of men), syphilis (11% of women, 8% of men), and Trichomonas vaginalis (6% of women). At enrollment, women, participants with no schooling, participants with greater than four sex partners, and single participants were found to be at increased risk for HSV-2 infection (p < 0.05). The two most common incident STIs at 12 months were HSV-2 with 12% of men and 8% of women testing positive and hepatitis B with 2% of men and 5% of women testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. In this cohort of South Indian men and women with a high background prevalence of HSV-2, suppressive therapy against herpes replication may have a substantial impact in reducing both HSV-2 transmission and HIV acquisition. With the high incidence of STIs, targeted prevention and clinical management strategies among individuals practicing high risk behaviors may help to slow the continued spread of HIV in India."
4864,0.001,1.0000,"HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR) can compromise antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited countries like China where ART has been scaled up and thus leads to an important public health concern. The aim of the study was to elucidate the HIV-1 genetic characteristics and TDR in Hangzhou, China. Two-hundred eleven ART-naive, newly diagnosed individuals were enrolled during January and August 2013. Specimens were classified as recent or chronic infections using the BED capture enzyme immunoassay (BED-CEIA). The pol fragment covering the entire protease and the first 300 codons of the reverse transcriptase gene was amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR. Genotypic drug resistance (DR) and phylogenetic analysis were performed on the 200 obtained sequences. Multiple genotypes were identified, including CRF01_AE (62.0%), CRF07_BC (31.0%), subtype B (2.0%), CRF08_BC (1.5%), CRF55_01B (1.0%), CRF18_cpx (0.5%), and unique recombinant forms (URFs, 2.0%). All the four URFs were found in men who have sex with men, consisting of a recombination of CRF01_AE with subtype B or CRF07_BC. The prevalence of primary DR in newly diagnosed individuals in Hangzhou was low (4.0%). The proportion of DR mutation to protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. BED-CEIA revealed that 21.8% (45/211) of the specimens were associated with recent infections. The prevalence of TDR in recent infections was moderate (6.5%). High HIV diversity and relatively high prevalence of TDR in new infections has been found in Hangzhou, indicating an increasing challenge for future HIV prevention and treatment."
5967,0.001,1.0000,"The transmission and prevalence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) among those employed as sex trade workers (STW) is a major public health concern. The present study describes the self-reported responses of 340 STW, at-risk for contracting HIV. The participants were recruited by selective targeting between 2009 and 2010 from within the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR), Saskatchewan, Canada. As of 2012, the SHR has the highest incidence rate of positive test reports for HIV in Canada, at more than three times the national average (17.0 vs. 5.9 per 100,000 people). Additionally, the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in the SHR is different from that seen elsewhere in Canada (still mostly men having sex with men and Caucasians), with its new HIV cases predominantly associated with injection drug use and Aboriginal cultural status. The purpose of this study was to (a) describe the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the STW in the SHR, (b) identify their significant life events, self-reported problems, knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, self-efficacy, and barriers regarding HIV, and (c) determine the significant independent risk indicators for STW self-reporting a chance of greater than 50% of becoming infected with HIV/AIDS. The majority of the study participants were females, who were never married, of Aboriginal descent, without a high school diploma, and had an annual income of less than $10,000. Using multivariate regression analysis, four significant independent risk indicators were associated with STW reporting a greater that 50% chance of acquiring HIV/AIDS, including experiencing sexual assault as a child, injecting drugs in the past four weeks, being homeless, and a previous Chlamydia diagnosis. These findings provide important evidence of the essential sexual and drug-related vulnerabilities associated with the risk of HIV infection among STW and offer insight into the design and implementation of effective and culturally sensitive public health intervention and prevention efforts. To be most effective, it is recommended that such intervention and prevention initiatives: (1) use specifically tailored community-based outreach to high risk STW who are drug users and link them with appropriate drug treatment and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services, (2) provide free and confidential, routine HIV counseling and testing in substance abuse programs, and (3) build capacity among the local, Aboriginal NGOs so as to address with cultural sensitivity both the drug and HIV-related risk factors prevalent among this vulnerable population."
387,0.001,1.0000,"A study was conducted in new patients registered with tuberculosis (TB) in a rural district of Malawi to determine (i) the prevalence of malnutrition on admission and (ii) the association between malnutrition and early mortality (defined as death within the first 4 weeks of treatment). There were 1181 patients with TB (576 men and 605 women), whose overall rate of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 80%. 673 TB patients (57%) were malnourished on admission (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m2). There were 259 patients (22%) with mild malnutrition (BMI 17.0-18.4 kg/m2), 168 (14%) with moderate malnutrition (BMI 16.0-16.9 kg/m2) and 246 (21%) with severe malnutrition (BMI < 15.9 kg/m2). 95 patients (8%) died during the first 4 weeks. Significant risk factors for early mortality included increasing degrees of malnutrition, age > 35 years, and HIV seropositivity. Among all the 1181 patients, 10.9% of the 414 patients with moderate to severe malnutrition died in the first 4 weeks compared with 6.5% of the 767 patients with normal to mild malnutrition (odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.7). In patients with TB, BMI < 17.0 kg/m2 is associated with an increased risk of early death."
9050,0.001,1.0000,"The aims of this study were to investigate the efficacy of prolonged entecavir (ETV) therapy in treatment-naive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and to determine whether continuous ETV therapy is feasible to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, particularly in patients with partial virological response (PVR). A total of 142 treatment-naive patients with CHB were enrolled. The mean duration of treatment was 65 (range, 26 to 90) months, and 86 patients (60.6%) were HBeAg positive. PVR was defined as detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (>116 copies/ml) at year 1. The cumulative incidence of virological response (VR) increased from 54.9% at year 1 to 98.2% at year 7. HBeAg positivity (odds ratio [OR], 4.146; P = 0.001) and initial alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR, 0.997; P = 0.004) were independent risk factors for PVR. Among the 64 patients with PVR, 47 patients (73.4%) achieved VR within 4 years after prolonged ETV therapy without treatment adaptation. Three patients (2.1%) experienced virological breakthrough and HBV variants with genotypic resistance. The cumulative rate of HBeAg seroconversion was significantly higher in the patients with VR than in the patients with PVR (P = 0.018). None of the PVR patients with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1 ever experienced HBeAg seroconversion. Multivariate analysis identified VR at year 1 as the only determinant of HBeAg seroconversion (hazard ratio [HR], 3.009; P = 0.010). In conclusion, although there were patients with PVR, prolonged ETV therapy showed excellent VR, with only 2.1% emergence of viral resistance during a 7-year follow-up. However, to achieve HBeAg seroconversion, drug modification is needed for HBeAg-positive patients with PVR (especially those with HBV DNA at ≥5,000 copies/ml at year 1). "
9181,0.001,1.0000,"A total of 390 parenteral drug abusers (PDAs) at the Kaohsiung Municipal Narcotics Abstention Institute were examined for markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), surface antibody (anti-HBs), and core antibody (anti-HBc) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) were also tested for HBsAg-positive serum samples. Although the HBsAg-positive rate (22.1%) among PDAs was similar to that of the general population in southern Taiwan, the HBV infection rate (99.2%) and the anti-HDV-positive rate (78.5%) among HBsAg-positive subjects were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). None of the PDAs studied were positive for anti-HIV. The levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) among PDAs were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). The more frequent the institutionalisation, the higher the infection rates with HBV and HDV and elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT. Horizontal transmission through parenteral drug abuse may be considered a possible reason for the significantly higher rates of HBV and HDV among parenteral drug abusers."

The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of HTLV1/2 in a population of HIV1-infected patients in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Of the 505 studied patients, four (0.79%) were positive for anti-HTLV1/2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with HTLV1 infection confirmed by line immunoassay (LIA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of the ELISA-positive samples. No cases of HTLV2 infection were observed. The prevalence of HTLV1/HIV1 coinfection was 0.79% (4/505; 95% CI: 0.25-2.16). All the coinfected patients reported sexual risk behaviors and only one reported intravenous drug use. Sequencing of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) region and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four HTLV1 isolates belonged to the Transcontinental a subgroup of the Cosmopolitan (1a) subtype, the most frequent subgroup detected in Brazil.

TTV infection was diagnosed by detection of TTV-DNA in serum, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV-DNA was estimated in a total number of one hundred patients with CRF and in 100 voluntary blood donors as controls. The markers of HBV and HCV were also tested in sera samples of these patients. TTV-DNA was detected in 39 of 100 patients (39%) with CRF and in 27 of 100 (27%) healthy controls. The analysis of the results demonstrated HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and HCV core antigen in 5.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 4.0% of patients, respectively. This study could not show any association of TTV with HBV and HCV infections for the transmission pattern or any impact on severity of diseases caused by these viruses in CRF patients. TTV also could not show any association with demographic characteristics of patients, duration of dialysis, number of blood transfusions and renal/liver function of the patients. As such, this study concludes that TTV appears as a benign pathogen, showing no sign of renal/liver damage or any change in the severity of diseases caused by blood-borne hepatitis viruses."

All study participants underwent a structured interview, determination of HIV serostatus and detection of HPV cervical infection by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Overall, the cervical presence of HPV DNA was ascertained in 86 of these 236 women (36.4%), while squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) were diagnosed in 57 (24.1%). HPV-infected and non-infected women did not differ in age, education and cigarette smoking. A statistically significant trend in the risk of HPV infection with increasing number of lifetime sexual partners was noted (P = 0.01), but such trend was attenuated in multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression (MLR) odds ratio (OR) for > or = 20 partners vs 1 = 1.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.4-5.9). A nearly threefold higher risk of HPV cervical infection emerged among IVDU women (MLR-OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.0), and this difference was not influenced by HIV serostatus. The prevalence of HIV infection was higher among HPV-positive than HPV-negative women (62.8% and 54.0%, respectively) (MLR-OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9-3.8), and the proportion of women with less than 200 CD4+ cells/mm3 was slightly and not significantly higher among HPV-positive (47.1%) than negative women (37.2%)."

We describe a retrospective study of 78 HIV-infected patients with NHL treated between 1999 and 2006 at the Infectology Institute, a reference center for HIV treatment in São Paulo, Brazil. All patients were treated with standard CHOP therapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). An evaluation of treatment response was available for 48 (61.5%) of the patients who completed initial treatment. Twenty-three patients (47.9%) achieved a complete response (CR), 3 (6.3%) achieved a partial response, and 22 (45.8%) failed to respond to treatment. Of the 30 patients (38.5%) who were not available for response evaluation, 23 died of sepsis during treatment, 5 abandoned treatment, and 2 are still under treatment. After a median follow-up of 3 years, the overall survival rate for all patients is 20.5%. A univariate analysis showed a significant CR rate in patients with respect to the following factors: no acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis prior to the lymphoma, disease stage of I to II, and an International Prognostic Index (IPI) of low or low-intermediate risk. A multivariate analysis indicated that only a previous AIDS diagnosis and the IPI were significantly related to the CR rate. A median disease-free survival (DFS) time for the patients who achieved a CR was not reached, with a mean survival time of 73 months and a 3-year DFS rate of 77.5%.

It makes sense to notice that comorbidity case alowgwith tuberculosis, intestinal candidiasis, bacterial pneumonia and Kaposi's diseases were found out. The screening of the cerebrospinal fluid showed a sound cell count and even low count in 12.2% of cases. Direct examination of cerebrospinal fluid with India ink helps in diagnosis of 97.5% of cases, and the culture carried out from 74 patients was in any case positive. This culture allowed the diagnosis of three patients whose examination along side with India ink has been negative. The CD4 cell count was less than 100/mm(3) in 97.7% of cases. The rate of the fatality cases has been 66.4%, it has been badly impacted by a CD4 count <50/mm(3) and the lack of antiretroviral therapy.

Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) have been smuggled into the country and available without prescription since the early 1990s, but are now provided free of cost by the government. We assessed the prevalence of HIV-1, drug resistance, and subtype distributions. Blood specimens were collected from HIV-1-infected participants registered in Sindh Province on dry blood spot (DBS) cards in 2008. Pol, protease, and partial reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. Primary drug resistance was analyzed by the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool using the Stanford Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation (SDRM) major mutation list. Out of 100 blood samples collected, 42 were suitable for testing. Out of 42, 11 were ARV-receiving and 31 ARV-naive patients. Among them, 24 were injection drug users (IDUs), four immigrants, two hijras (male transvestites), two men who have sex with men (MSM), four prisoners, one female sex workers, two spouses of HIV-infected persons, and four from the general population. ARV resistance among naive patients was 2/31 (6.5%) and 36.4% (4/11) among ARV-experienced patients making an overall resistance of 14.2%. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant subtype found in 35/42 (83.3%) followed by CRF35_AD and C, 6.5% each. Subtype D and G were found in one (2.4%) each.

Physicians treating patients should consider the magnitude of drug resistance while selecting regimens, and address drug adherence aggressively."
8781,0.001,1.0000,"Dolutegravir is a preferred antiretroviral drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients following solid organ transplantation. It has potent antiretroviral activity and does not interact with calcineurin inhibitors. We describe a case of an HIV-infected kidney transplant patient, who was noted to have a rising serum creatinine following initiation of dolutegravir. At first, an acute rejection episode was suspected, but this finding was later attributed to inhibition of creatinine secretion by dolutegravir. We suggest that an awareness of this potential effect of dolutegravir is important for providers who take care of HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients, in order to prevent potentially unnecessary testing.

1667,0.001,1.0000,"The effect of interleukin (IL)-12 on T lymphocyte function was assessed in 47 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons of different disease stages and 16 seronegative controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPR) were measured to various HIV and non-HIV antigens and mitogens using peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured with or without IL-12. Without exogenous IL-12, 96% of HIV-seropositive persons responded to mitogens, 77% to >=1 non-HIV antigen, and 11% to >=1 HIV antigen. Supplementation with IL-12 augmented LPR of HIV-seropositive persons to non-HIV antigens; however, the effect was greatest for those with higher CD4 cells (40% vs. 9% for those with >200 vs. <=200 CD4 cells/mm3). Addition of IL-12 also enhanced LPR to HIV antigens in 30% of subjects. This effect was most pronounced for those with>500 CD4 cells/mm3 (56% [P<. 05]). These findings suggest that impaired T lymphocyte recognition of foreign antigen, including HIV, can be reconstituted in part for selected HIV-seropositive persons."
7019,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the clinical and economic consequences of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in a health care system with access unrestricted by financial barriers. The analysis was performed from a health care perspective and compared azithromycin (1200 mg/week) with no prophylaxis over a period of 10 years based on data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and randomized controlled trials. The main outcome measures were: expected survival; average health care costs; and cost-effectiveness in 1997 Swiss francs ( pound1 corresponds to about 2.3 CHF) per life-year saved. In patients with an initial CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3) and no AIDS, azithromycin increased expected survival by 4 months. In patients with AIDS, HAART durability had a major impact on expected survival and costs. Incremental survival increased from 2 to 4 months if we assumed a 10 year, instead of a 3 year, HAART effect. The cost-effectiveness of azithromycin relative to no prophylaxis in patients without AIDS was between 47,000 CHF (3-year HAART effect) and 60,000 CHF (10-year HAART effect) per life-year saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased to 118,000 CHF per life-year saved in patients with symptomatic AIDS. In conclusion, in the era of HAART, MAC prophylaxis with azithromycin increases expected survival and reduces health care costs substantially. Starting MAC prophylaxis in patients without AIDS is more effective and cost-effective than in patients with AIDS."

In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
6427,0.001,1.0000,Mycobacterium leprae and HIV cause infectious diseases of great concern for the public health care sector worldwide. Both are especially worrisome diseases when patients become co-infected and exhibit the expected clinical exuberance.

2591,0.001,1.0000,"There are contrasting data in the literature about antituberculosis plasma drug concentrations in HIV-1-coinfected patients. We report the pharmacokinetics of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide in a cohort of patients being treated for active tuberculosis, the majority of whom were coinfected with HIV-1 and had commenced antiretroviral therapy within 2 months of starting antituberculosis treatment. We also examined the association between antituberculosis drug concentrations and reported drug side effects at the 2-month clinical review. One hundred patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (65% coinfected with HIV-1) were intensively sampled to determine rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide plasma concentrations after 7 to 8 weeks of a daily quadruple-therapy regimen dosed according to World Health Organization (WHO) weight bands. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for each patient by using nonlinear mixed-effects models. HIV-1-coinfected patients had lower clearance rates for rifampin (21% decrease) and isoniazid (23% decrease) than HIV-1-uninfected patients, with resulting higher areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) and maximum concentrations of drug in serum (Cmax). Antiretroviral therapy (ART) that included double-standard-dose lopinavir/ritonavir further lowered rifampin clearance, by 46%, and increased the AUC0-24 The current uniform dosing (per kilogram of body weight) across WHO weight bands was associated with a trend of decreased pharmacokinetic exposures for the lowest weight band. Use of fat-free mass as opposed to total body weight for allometric scaling of clearance significantly improved the model. Ambulant HIV-1-coinfected patients, the majority of whom were coprescribed ART, did not have reduced antituberculosis drug concentrations compared to HIV-1-uninfected patients."

Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection. The outbreak stresses the need for appropriate and generally applied standard procedures in nursing homes to prevent bloodborne pathogens."

HBV genotypes, surface antigen (HBsAg) subtypes, and HBsAg ""a"" determinant mutations among patients infected chronically with HBV, were investigated. Serum samples from 135 HBsAg positive patients were tested. Serologic (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe), virologic (HBV-DNA quantitation) and biochemical markers (serum alanine aminotransferase/ALT and aspartate aminotransferase/AST) were analyzed. HBV genotypes and HBsAg subtypes were determined by partial sequencing of the S gene. Genotyping was performed by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information online Genotyping tool and phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were aligned pair wise with ClustalW and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Sequences were also used to predict HBV HBsAg subtypes. In six patients (4%), simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was determined, whereas 47 patients (35%) were HBeAg positive, 84 (62.5%) were anti-HBe positive, and four patients (3%) were characterized by the simultaneous presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe. Mean ALT was 238 IU/L (standard deviation = 576.84), and HBV-DNA levels ranged from 1.02 × 10(5) to 2.2 × 10(7) IU/ml. Genotype D was predominant (98%), with viral groups D/ayw2 (73%) and D/ayw3 (27%). Group A/adw accounted for 1% of cases. Genotypes B and C were found exclusively in the Chinese immigrants (1%). Single or multiple point mutations were found in 35 cases (26%). Some of the most common mutations occurred at amino acid positions 129, 133, 134, 144, 145, including the ""vaccine escape"" mutation G145R. Mutations analysis revealed that amino acid substitutions did not affect detection by commercial immunoassays."
3825,0.001,1.0000,"Health care workers (HCW) are a population at high risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, especially in endemic countries such as Lao PDR. Effective vaccines are available since over 10 years, but many HCWs are not aware of the risk of infection and are still not immunized against hepatitis B. This study aimed to assess immunization coverage against hepatitis B among the students of the University of Health Sciences (UHS) of Lao PDR in 2013 and to look for the causes of non-vaccination. A cross-sectional survey was conducted by self-administered questionnaire on a representative stratified sample of each academic year in each faculty. In total, 961 questionnaires were collected, Basic Sciences: 143, Medicine: 167, Pharmacy: 148, Dentistry: 139, Nursing Sciences: 159, Medical Technology: 99, and Postgraduate Studies: 106. Respondents were predominantly female (59.1%), mean age 25.1±7.0 years, single (76.3%), from the provinces (68.0%), of the Lao Loum ethnic group (84.4%). Among them, 21% were fully vaccinated against hepatitis B and 9.5% partially. Immunization coverage rates were significantly higher among women (p=0.01), students aged over 25 years, married or belonging to the post-graduate faculty (p<0.001). The most common reason (38.6%) given for non-vaccination was not knowing where to get vaccinated. Knowledge about hepatitis B, scored from 0 to 5, was poor (0-1) for 86.5% of the students, but 77.5% were aware of the hepatitis B vaccine. The knowledge scores were significantly higher for students aged over 25 years, married or post-graduated (p<0.001). Vaccination coverage against hepatitis B is dramatically low among students of health professions in Laos, largely because of their lack of knowledge and awareness. Upon admission to the University, all future HCWs should receive information about the occupational risks of blood-borne viruses transmission and be encouraged to get vaccinated against hepatitis B.

5890,0.001,1.0000,"We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy."
6067,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."

This study aims to evaluate the impact of demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics on the treatment outcome and mortality of TB/HIV co-infected patients in a tertiary TB centre in Iran. In total, 111 patients were recruited from 2004 to 2007. Mycobacteriological studies and demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from all patients were analysed and predictors of unsuccessful outcomes as well as mortality were determined. The mean age for all 111 TB-HIV patients was 38 ± 9 years (range 22-70) and 107 (96.3%) were men; 104 (93.7%) had a history of drug abuse and 96 (86.4%) had a history of imprisonment. The method of HIV transmission was intravenous drug use in 88 (79.3%). Twenty-three (20.7%) had a history of Category 1 (CAT I) TB treatment and six (5.4%) Category 2 (CAT II) treatment. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was given to 48 (43.2%). No significant associations were found between treatment outcomes or mortality and gender, smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, imprisonment, method of transmission, history of CAT I and CAT II treatments, CD4 counts or adverse effects (P > 0.05). Administration of cART led to significantly better outcomes (P < 0.001). Lower serum albumin levels and low body weight were significantly associated with mortality."
1475,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients. We discuss several factors presumably associated with acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected patients, including exogenous reinfection, drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs, and the presence of a large organism burden."
3773,0.001,1.0000,"A 49 year-old man was referred to our hospital for fear of developing fulminant hepatic failure. There had been an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B in a dialysis clinic in the western part of Honshu, Japan, that resulted in four deaths among six patients. After the sixth patient contracted severe hepatitis, all patients in the unit were screened biweekly for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to detect newly infected patients as soon as possible. Our patient was the seventh victim, and on the day he gave a positive result for HBsAg, his hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level had reached 1.1 x 10(11) copies/ml as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the causal HBV revealed the presence of a mutation in the precore region (nt 1896), two mutations in the core promoter (nt 1762 and nt 1764), and some minor mutations in the P gene that were restricted to the upstream region. These mutations are indicative of a virus with a high replicative rate that cannot secrete HBeAg. Taken together, these findings indicate that it is very likely that the replicative ability of the causal virus was as vigorous as that of HBV in hepatitis B e antigen-positive asymptomatic carriers with markedly high viral titers. The present case report provides clinical evidence of a possible association between the rapid spread of highly replicative HBV before host immunological recognition and the development of fulminant hepatitis."

As widely used anti-HIV agents, zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV), and as drugs of recent approval raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV), were utilized as reference drugs. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus was prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with purified plasmid DNA and quantified by p24 antigen-capture assay. For infection, CEM-GFP cells were exposed to vehicle or to several concentrations of the drugs for 2 hr at 37 °C before HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to each sample. The adsorption was prolonged for 3 hr at 37 °C. After 72 hr of incubation, HIV-induced GFP expression in infected CEM-GFP cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and expressed as % positive cells. For comparison, p24 production in supernatants was assessed by a commercial ELISA kit. On the basis of IC50 values, the anti-HIV activity, as assayed by this method, was EFV > 3TC > AZT > NVP > DDI > ABC and ETR > RPV > RAL. The comparison between the IC50 values calculated through flow cytometry and p24 production revealed overlapping results, showing that the optimized protocol of CEM-GFP infection with HIV NL4-3 is a suitable method to perform quantitative, rapid and low-expensive screening tests to evaluate the in vitro effect of new candidate anti-HIV drugs."

Diarrhoeal specimens were inoculated onto standard culture media as well as onto Columbia and Campylobacter blood agar media for C. jejuni isolation. All the C. jejuni isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using Kirby-Bauer's method. A significant difference in recovery rates was observed between the 2 groups in relation to C. jejuni (p < or = 0.02; 95% CI 5.5 (1-10) and Shigella spp. (p < or = 0.02; 95% CI 6.5 (1-12). 21 isolates of Shigella spp., 16 C. jejuni, 5 Salmonella typhi, 3 Arcobacter spp., 3 Yersinia enterocolitica, and 2 Aeromonas hydrophila were recovered from the HIV infected cases. All the C. jejuni isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin whereas 1 strain was resistant to nalidixic acid. Interestingly, all the 29 Shigella spp. (21 from HIV and 8 from non-HIV cases) were resistant to erythromycin and most were resistant to many other antibiotics used. Our observations underline the need for epidemiological investigations to screen C. jejuni and Shigella spp. in HIV infected subjects with diarrhoea and analyse their antibiograms periodically to minimize disease burden in HIV/AIDS."
3510,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B (HBV) virus infection is characterized by the overproduction of subviral particles (SVP) over infectious Dane particles (VP). Precise regulation of the ratio between these forms is unknown, but its fluctuation may have a clinical impact. An enrichment method was applied to assess the SVP/VP ratio in chronically infected patients (CHB) and to compare the sensitivity of HBs antigen (HBsAg) and DNA detection methods. Plasmas from 9 genotype A-D CHB patients were fractionated on Nycodenz(®) gradients, and both HBV DNA and HBsAg were quantified in each collected fraction using standardized techniques expressed in IU/mL. Infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) was performed with crude or fractionated plasma. Independently of the genotype, all plasmas showed a similar rate-zonal separation profile characterized by a bottom DNA-enriched peak surmounted by HBsAg-enriched fractions. Inoculation of PHH with plasma-derived VP-enriched fractions led to long-lasting production of virus in cell supernatants with a SVP/VP ratio similar to that observed in patient plasmas. In the VP fraction, one IU of HBsAg corresponded to approximately 5 million IU of HBV DNA. Rate-zonal gradient separation directly applied on patient plasma allows a better insight into the distribution of VP in HBeAg-positive CHB carriers. This study highlights the sensitivity difference of the techniques classically used to monitor HBV infection and indicates that VP-associated HBsAg contributes modestly to the overall amount of total circulating HBsAg in CHB. Such a fractionation approach should help to understand the fine regulation of HBsAg production over replication at different stages of CHB. "
5506,0.001,1.0000,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."
6055,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes complex metabolic changes in infected CD4(+) T cells that lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death by necrosis. To study the viral functions responsible for deleterious effects on the host cell, we quantitated the course of HIV type 1 infection in tissue cultures by using flow cytometry for a virally encoded marker protein, heat-stable antigen (HSA). We found that HSA appeared on the surface of the target cells in two phases: passive acquisition due to association and fusion of virions with target cells, followed by active protein expression from transcription of the integrated provirus. The latter event was necessary for decreased target cell viability. We developed a general mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro in terms of three effective time-dependent rates: those of cell proliferation, infection, and death. Using this model we show that the predominant contribution to the depletion of viable target cells results from direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade. This allows us to derive accurate bounds on the time-dependent death rates of infected cells. We infer that the death rate of HIV-infected cells is 80 times greater than that of uninfected cells and that the elimination of the vpr protein reduces the death rate by half. Our approach provides a general method for estimating time-dependent death rates that can be applied to study the dynamics of other viruses."
7068,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to represent a global health concern with an estimated 350 - 400 million people infected worldwide. Current treatment options are either of two IFN-based therapies or either of five oral nucleos(t)ide analogs which are used as monotherapy or in combination. Control of viral replication can be achieved basically in all patients today. However, despite the clinical efficacy of antivirals, long-term management remains a clinical challenge mainly due to the slow kinetics of HBsAg clearance. Emergence of viral resistance has been a challenge in the past with some but not all oral therapies. The development of novel therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action might provide new opportunities to clear HBsAg and achieve HBsAg seroconversion which could be maintained off therapy. The long-term efficacy of combinations of IFN and/or nucleos(t)ide analogs might achieve antiviral synergy, preventing drug resistance and clearing viral covalently close circular DNA and infected cells."
6955,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has fundamentally changed the clinical outcome of HIV infection and AIDS. However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."

This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high.

The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge level of health visitors about HIV infection and AIDS, and to identify some of the attitudes held by them concerning AIDS and the variety of symptoms that can occur in HIV positive individuals (AIDS related complex) before they have actually developed AIDS. The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."
301,0.001,1.0000,"Recent studies have found geographic variations in immune and viral human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes associated with census measures of neighborhood poverty and segregation. Although readily available, such aggregate census measures are not based on health behavior models and provide limited information regarding neighborhood effect pathways. In contrast, survey-based measures can capture specific aspects of neighborhood disadvantage that may better inform community-based interventions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the measurement validity of multi-dimensional survey measures of neighborhood disorder compared with census measures as predictors of HIV outcomes in a cohort of 197 low-income women in a major metropolitan area. The multi-dimensional survey measures were related to each other and to census measures of concentrated poverty and racial segregation, but not so highly correlated as to be uniform. We found notable variation between community areas in women's CD4 levels but there was no corresponding geographic variance in viral load, and relationships between community area measures and viral load disappeared after adjustment for individual characteristics, including HIV treatment adherence. In multilevel models adjusting for individual characteristics including substance use, depression, and HIV treatment adherence, one survey measure of neighborhood disadvantage (poor-quality built environment) and one census measure (racial segregation) were significantly associated with greater likelihood of CD4 < 500 (p < .05)."
3610,0.001,1.0000,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."

9237,0.001,1.0000,"Immunoglobulin assays that are sensitive and specific for detecting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are especially important in developing countries where PCR and viral culture may not be readily available. Immunoglobulin E (IgE), which is elevated in HIV-1 infection, is the only antibody that does not cross the placenta, making it potentially valuable for viral detection in both children and adults. This study developed an assay for detection of HIV specific IgE antibodies in adults. A total of 170 serum samples from 170 adults (116 HIV positive and 54 HIV negative) were analyzed. Serum or plasma samples were treated by using the protein G affinity method. The HIV status was determined by using two IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and one Western blot evaluation. The IgE enzyme immunoassay test for HIV-1 correctly identified the HIV status in 98.8% of the samples (168 of 170). One false-positive and one false-negative test occurred with the IgE ELISA, as well as with the IgG ELISA test but were correctly identified by the IgE test. Analysis of the data demonstrated a high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (99%) of the IgE test, with 95% confidence intervals. The IgE assay appears to be sensitive and specific, suggesting that IgE-specific antibodies offer an effective method to detect HIV-1 infection in adults."
8327,0.001,1.0000,"Cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations undermine the durability of effective human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. The rate of CTL escape from a given response is largely governed by the net of all escape-associated viral fitness costs and benefits. The observation that CTL escape mutations can carry an associated fitness cost in terms of reduced virus replication capacity (RC) suggests a fitness cost-benefit trade-off that could delay CTL escape and thereby prolong CD8 response effectiveness. However, our understanding of this potential fitness trade-off is limited by the small number of CTL escape mutations for which a fitness cost has been quantified. Here, we quantified the fitness cost of the 29 most common HIV-1B Gag CTL escape mutations using an in vitro RC assay. The majority (20/29) of mutations reduced RC by more than the benchmark M184V antiretroviral drug resistance mutation, with impacts ranging from 8% to 69%. Notably, the reduction in RC was significantly greater for CTL escape mutations associated with protective HLA class I alleles than for those associated with nonprotective alleles. To speed the future evaluation of CTL escape costs, we also developed an in silico approach for inferring the relative impact of a mutation on RC based on its computed impact on protein thermodynamic stability. These data illustrate that the magnitude of CTL escape-associated fitness costs, and thus the barrier to CTL escape, varies widely even in the conserved Gag proteins and suggest that differential escape costs may contribute to the relative efficacy of CD8 responses."
2341,0.001,1.0000,"It is becoming increasingly important to identify and to study human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) with evidence of epidemic spread, since mosaic strains arise frequently, especially in populations where multiple subtypes cocirculate. We describe the almost complete nucleotide sequence of 3 subtype C and D recombinant viruses, selected from a pool of 13 D(gag)-D/C/D(env) perinatally infected infants from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All three genomes had cross-over points with approximately the same genomic localization. The subtype C-like sequences were located within pol, vif, vpr, vpu, the first exons of rev and tat, V3, and the U3-R regions of the LTR. Phylogenetic analyses of the full-length genomic sequences from these viruses showed the formation of a distinct subcluster on the HIV-1 subtype D branch. The pattern of recombination of genomes belonging to this new CRF, named CRF10_CD, might have resulted from independent recombination events occurring at high frequency or from a single source that originated earlier in this population. Future surveys will be needed to determine the potential of this CRF for epidemic spread."
5187,0.001,1.0000,"During the past decade, AIDS has become a global health problem with 182,000 cases reported from 152 countries. It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9245,0.001,1.0000,"Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus has been recognized as a cause of systemic illness in immunocompromised hosts, including relapsing bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Acquired resistance to quinolone therapy, while reported for a variety of bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, has not been previously documented for C. fetus. Two cases of quinolone-resistant C. fetus bacteremia were detected in HIV-infected patients. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the C. fetus gyrA gene in the 2 resistant isolates demonstrated a G-to-T change that led to an Asp-to-Tyr amino acid substitution at a critical residue frequently associated with quinolone resistance. In addition, comparison of the pre- and posttreatment isolates from 1 patient documented outer membrane protein changes temporally linked with the development of resistance. Relapsing C. fetus infections in quinolone-treated HIV-infected patients may be associated with the acquisition of resistance to these agents, and this resistance may be multifactorial."
335,0.001,1.0000,"Since the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for HIV infection, there have been increasing reports of systemic manifestations of immune restoration. This new clinical syndrome among HIV-infected patients is associated with underlying co-infections with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C infections, etc.... We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment. She developed fever, large abscesses and pleural and peritoneal effusions. Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
9542,0.001,1.0000,"This study aimed to determine the effect of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection on peripheral levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-18 and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNFRII). Serum levels were monitored for a 1-year period in 25 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) who were naive for HAART at the initiation of the study, and in four HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressors. Serum levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII at baseline were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls. Baseline levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII were not significantly different in long-term non-progressors compared with the other patients. HCV co-infected patients had significantly higher levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII at each time-point compared with patients who were not co-infected with HCV. Irrespective of HCV status, response to HAART resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII, particularly among patients who achieved HIV viral suppression, but the net decrease observed at the end of follow-up was lower in patients co-infected with HCV. No information was obtained from IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (p70) measurements. The data suggest that analysis of serum levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII may be a valuable tool for evaluating the response to HAART, and perhaps for assessing the degree of immune restoration achieved by HAART responders. The results also highlight the relevance of considering the HCV infection status of HIV-1-infected patients in order to avoid misinterpretation of IL-18 and sTNFRII measurements."
219,0.001,1.0000,"To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05). Among the patients with 1 year of follow-up, NVP therapy was significantly associated with developing rash and d4T therapy with developing peripheral neuropathy (p < 0.05). Anemia and hepatitis often occur within 12 weeks of initiating generic HAART. Frequent and early monitoring for these toxicities is warranted in developing countries where generic HAART is increasingly available."
9468,0.001,1.0000,"Infusional CDE (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide; iCDE) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic regimen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), with a complete remission rate of 46% and a median overall survival of 8.2 months (Sparano JA, Blood 1993; 81:2810). Since the majority of HIV-associated NHL are CD20-positive we reasoned that the addition of rituximab to iCDE (R-iCDE) could also improve the poor outcome of these patients. As a first step we investigated the safety of R-iCDE in a phase I/II study. Thirty patients with aggressive HIV-associated NHL were enrolled between June 1998 and October 2000. Characteristics of 29 evaluable patients were: median age: 38 years (range 29-65 years); male sex 24/29; histology: DLCL 16 (55%), Burkitt 10 (35%), ALCL 2 (7%), unclassified 1 (3%); stage: I (35%), II (10%), III (10%), IV (45%); International Prognostic Index: 0, 1 (59%), 2 (24%), 3 (17%), 4, 5 (0); CD4 count: median 132/ mm3 (range 3-470/mm3). Patients received rituximab (375 mg/m2) in conjunction with iCDE (five or six cycles). All patients were treated with G-CSF and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-six of 29 patients received treatment as planned, while chemotherapy had to be discontinued in three patients (2 persistent thrombocytopenias, 1 cerebral hemorrhage). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was observed as follows: neutropenia 79%, anemia 45%, thrombocytopenia 34%, bacterial infection 34%, opportunistic infection 7%, mucositis 17%. A dose reduction was necessary in 22%. Complete remission was achieved in 86% of the patients, partial remission in 4%. Ten percent had progressive disease. After a median follow-up of 9 months the median overall survival is not reached. The actuarial survival at 2 years is 80% and the actuarial progression-free survival is 79%. Four of 29 patients (14%) have died, three from NHL and one from cryptosporidiosis. These findings suggest that the combination of rituximab with iCDE in patients with HIV-associated NHL is safe and feasible and that the addition of the anti-CD20 antibody does not increase the risk for infections. The high complete remission rate also indicates a potential therapeutic benefit and warrants further randomized trials."
4480,0.001,1.0000,"Through this study we evaluated whether the HIV-1 tropism determined by genotypic analysis correlates with HIV-1 markers, such as CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-RNA. The analysis was performed on 1221 HIV-1 B-subtype infected patients with an available V3 sequence (all maraviroc naive). Of them, 532 were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive and 689 ART experienced. Tropism determination was performed by using the geno2pheno (co-receptor) algorithm set at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10% and 2%. Potential associations of FPR with CD4 cell count and viraemia were evaluated. Association of V3 mutations with genotypic-determined tropism was also evaluated according to different FPR ranges. About 26% of patients (either ART naive or ART experienced) were infected by X4-tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cut-off). However, a significantly lower proportion of ART-naive patients had FPR ≤ 2% in comparison with ART-experienced patients (4.9% vs. 12.6%, respectively, p <0.001). The risk of advanced HIV-1 infection (with CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3)) was significantly greater in X4-infected patients, either ART-naive (OR (95% CI)), 4.2 (1.8-9.2); p 0.0006) or ART-experienced (2.3 (1.4-3.6); p 0.0003), with FPR set at 2% (but not at 10%). This finding was confirmed by multivariable logistic analysis. No relationship was found between viraemia and FPR ≤2%. Some X4-related mutations were significantly associated with FPR ≤2% (ART-naive patients, S11R, Y21V, G24K and G24R, p ≤0.001; ART-experienced patients, Y7K, S11R, H13Y, p ≤0.002). In conclusion, these findings show that within the context of genotypically-assessed CXCR4 tropism, FPR ≤2% defines (far better than 10%-FPR) a viral population associated with low CD4 rank, with potentially greater cytopathic effect, and with more advanced disease."
6999,0.001,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) primarily involves a subgroup of T-lymphocytic cells, but other cell types are also invaded by the virus, including cell lines within the haematopoietic system. Together with infectious, inflammatory and neoplasic processes, invasion of haematopoietic tissue explains the haematological alterations which are seen during the course of infection with HIV-1. Anaemia develops in the large proportion of patients. Thrombocytopenia frequently occurs during the course of the disease, but may be seen in some patients already at the time of diagnosis, where the condition may be misdiagnosed as ""idiopathic"" thrombocytopenic purpura. Neutropenia is seen in all disease stages, but is most severe in patients with advanced disease. Bone marrow changes include varying degrees of dysplasia in one or more cell lines, which in some patients may mimic a myelodysplastic syndrome. The number of plasma cells is always increased. In many patients the bone marrow stroma exhibits an increased amount of reticular fibres. HIV-1 infection is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin malignant lymphoma. Acute myelogenous leukaemia and myelomatosis have been described in patients with advanced disease. Treatment of the above mentioned haematological abnormalities aims primarily at reducing replication of HIV-1, thereby diminishing suppression of haematopoiesis by the virus infection, and at controlling the opportunistic infections during the course of the disease. Specific antiviral therapy (AZT) is most successful in correcting thrombocytopenia. The possibility of bone marrow suppression mediated by a toxic drug effect should always be considered in this patient group."

At least one gene was found in 52 (16.5%) samples, 50 (19.6%) from hospitals and 2 (3%) from schools. The AA probe was found in 36 (69%), the aggR gene was found in 41 (79%), and the aap gene was found in 49 (94%) of all positive samples. EAEC was significantly associated with diarrhea and intestinal inflammation and was significantly higher (chi(2) = 5.360, P = 0.021) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons (29.5%) than in HIV-negative persons (13.7%). The presence of EAEC genes was significantly associated with occult blood (chi(2) = 30.543, P < 0.0001) in the stool samples. This study suggests that the clinical presentation of EAEC infection may be directly related to the bacterial load as well as to the genetic characteristics of the strains involved."

We conducted a prospective study at the cholera treatment center (CTC) of GHESKIO in Haiti to characterize the coinfection. Adults admitted at the CTC for acute diarrhea were invited to participate in the study. Vital signs, frequency, and volume of stools and/or vomiting were monitored, and single-dose doxycycline was administered. After counseling, participants were screened for HIV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for cholera by culture. Of 729 adults admitted to the CTC, 99 (13.6%) had HIV infection, and 457 (63%) had culture-confirmed cholera. HIV prevalence was three times higher in patients without cholera (23%, 63/272) than in those with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%, 36/457). HIV prevalence in patients with culture-confirmed cholera (7.9%) was four times higher than the adult prevalence in Port-au-Prince (1.9%). Of the 36 HIV-infected patients with cholera, 25 (69%) had moderate/severe dehydration versus 302/421 (72%) in the HIV negative. Of 30 HIV-infected patients with weekly stool cultures performed after discharge, 29 (97%) were negative at week 1. Of 50 HIV-negative patients with weekly stool cultures, 49 (98%) were negative at week 1.

6857,0.001,1.0000,"The magnitude of intestinal parasitic infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients requires careful consideration in the developing world where poor nutrition is associated with poor hygiene and several tropical diseases. However, there have been very few studies addressing this issue in Cameroon. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Dschang -Cameroon. Stool and blood specimens from HIV/AIDS patients and control group were screened respectively for intestinal parasites and for HIV antibodies. Intestinal parasites were identified using direct microscopy, formalin-ether concentration and Ziehl Neelsen methods. Out of 396 participants recruited among patients consulting at hospital, 42 (10.6%) were HIV positive, thirty of them treatment naïve. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 14.64%. Out of 42 HIV/AIDS patients, 59.5% (25/42) were infected with intestinal parasites, while only 9.32% (33/354) of the HIV negative patients were infected with intestinal parasites. The parasites detected in our study population included Crystosporidium parvum (2.53%), Entamoeba histolytica (7.52%), Entamoeba coli (4.04%), Giardia lamblia (0.25%), Trichuris trichura (0.25%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%). In the HIV infected group, Crystosporidium parvum (19.04%), Entamoeba histolytica (19.04%), Entamoeba coli (21.42%), Giardia lamblia (2.38%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%) were found. Crystosporidium parvum was found to be significantly higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in controls (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the HIV status and the quality of water were the major risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. Routine examinations of stool samples for parasites would significantly benefit the HIV patients by contributing in reducing morbidity and improving the efficiency of antiretroviral treatment. Even after the introduction of free anti-retroviral drugs, opportunistic intestinal infections are still a threat. HIV patients should be screened routinely for intestinal parasites and treated for their overall well being."
8430,0.001,1.0000,"Natural killer cell responses play a crucial role in virus clearance by the innate immune system. Although the killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) in combination with its cognate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligand, especially KIR2DL3-HLA-C1, is associated with both treatment-induced and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Caucasians, these innate immunity genes have not been fully clarified in Japanese patients. We therefore investigated 16 KIR genotypes along with HLA-B and -C ligands and a genetic variant of interleukin (IL) 28B (rs8099917) in 115 chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 patients who underwent pegylated-interferon-α2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin therapy. HLA-Bw4 was significantly associated with a sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment (P = 0.017; odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, ), as was the centromeric A/A haplotype of KIR (P = 0.015; OR 3.37). In contrast, SVR rates were significantly decreased in patients with KIR2DL2 or KIR2DS2 (P = 0.015; OR = 0.30, and P = 0.025; OR = 0.32, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis subsequently identified the IL28B TT genotype (P = 0.00009; OR = 6.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.62 - 18.01), KIR2DL2/HLA-C1 (P = 0.014; OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.08 - 0.75), KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4 (P = 0.008, OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.37 - 8.05), and white blood cell count at baseline (P = 0.009; OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.35 - 8.16) as independent predictive factors of an SVR. We observed a significant association between the combination of IL28B TT genotype and KIR3DL1-HLA-Bw4 in responders (P = 0.0019), whereas IL28B TT along with KIR2DL2-HLA-C1 was related to a non-response (P = 0.0067). In conclusion, combinations of KIR3DL1/HLA-Bw4, KIR2DL2/HLA-C1, and a genetic variant of the IL28B gene are predictive of the response to PEG-IFN and ribavirin therapy in Japanese patients infected with genotype 1b HCV.

Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "
3731,0.001,1.0000,"Many AIDS patients retain a high CD4+ T cell count despite a significant increase in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-determined viral load after various periods of treatment by combination therapy. Our study involved 10 such AIDS patients who showed this discordance. In this study, we characterized changes in the gag gene of HIV-1 isolated from the plasma of such patients. Viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples and the gag gene was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. The PCR product was cloned and three clones from each patient were sequenced. All the sequences were aligned and compared with similar HIV-1 isolated from nontreated AIDS patients. Several kinds of changes were observed in the sequences including substitutions, frameshifts, and deletions. One patient showed a frameshift due to a missing G residue in the capsid-encoding region of the gene whereas another patient had virus with two different deletions. Such changes are probably due to combination therapy."

M genitalium was detected in 2 out of 19 non-AIDS (stage A and B) patients and in a similar proportion (1 out of 14; 7.1%) of samples from healthy individuals. A dramatic increase in the frequency of M. genitalium detection was observed in samples of AIDS (stage C) patients. In fact, 9 out of 16 (56.2%) specimens tested positive by PCR. We found no association in AIDS patients between M. genitalium infection and CD4 count, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) p24 antigenemia or opportunistic infection."
2897,0.001,1.0000,"The outcome of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) referred for liver transplantation (LT) is unknown. A high frequency of lamivudine-resistant (LAM-R) HBV infection may increase the risk of liver-related death pre-transplantation and prophylaxis failure post-transplantation. We evaluated the association of LAM-R HBV on pre-transplant survival and post-transplant outcomes in 35 consecutive HIV-HBV coinfected patients referred for LT between July 2000 and September 2002. At the time of referral, the median CD4 count was 273/mm, MELD was 14, and LAM-R HBV infection was present in 67%. Among these referred patients, 26% were listed, 29% not listed due to relative/absolute contraindications; 26% not listed as too early for LT; 9% not listed as too sick for LT; and 11% died during transplant evaluation. Of the 9 listed patients, 4 remained listed, 1 died 18 months post-referral, and 4 were transplanted (11% of total) 3 to 40 months after listing. Of 17 evaluated but not listed patients, 5 died (p=0.38 compared to listed group) and all deaths were liver-related. All the HBV-HIV coinfected patients, who were transplanted, are HBsAg negative and have undetectable HBV DNA levels on prophylactic therapy using hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) plus lamivudine, with and without tenofovir or adefovir, with median 33.1 months follow-up. Late referral and the presence of LAM-R HBV pre-transplantation are common in referred HIV-HBV patients. In HIV-HBV coinfected patients undergoing LT, HBV recurrence is successfully prevented with combination prophylaxis using HBIG and antivirals."

HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serological markers, sFas and TGF-β1 levels, and HBV load were evaluated in 116 patients. While there was no correlation between TGF-β1 levels and HBV load, a positive correlation between sFas levels and HBV load was observed in patients with occult HBV infection. "
958,0.001,1.0000,"A 1-year prospective analysis of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (zidovudine plus zalcitabine [55 patients] or zidovudine plus zalcitabine plus saquinavir [32 patients]) was performed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients attended at a tertiary care hospital. Adherence to therapy was measured jointly by pharmacy records, patients' self-recording, and an increase in mean corpuscular volume. Likewise, the effects of therapy on clinical parameters, HIV load, CD4+ cell count, and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and its soluble receptors were analyzed. Twenty-seven patients of those on a double-agent regimen and 12 of those on a triple-agent regimen adhered to the treatment. Ten opportunistic events occurred in noncompliant patients versus none in compliant individuals. A significant increase in CD4+ cell count and a decrease in HIV viral load were observed only in patients who adhered to therapy. TNF and its soluble receptors remained elevated at the end of follow-up, even in patients in whom the HIV viral load decreased to < 400 copies/ml. In conclusion, adherence to therapy must be considered a major factor influencing the results of antiretroviral therapy. Although these treatments have been demonstrated to be efficacious, they are not able to normalize the immune activation markers. These data suggest a suboptimal effect of antiretroviral therapy on the eradication of HIV-1."
8531,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence and the factors involved in discordant responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy were analysed in a closely followed cohort of 51 naïve HIV-infected patients at 48 weeks. A complete treatment response was considered as an increase in CD4 cell count of >or=50 cells/mm3 with a >or=1 log10 decrease in viral load or viral suppression. Virologic response (<50 CD4+ cells/mm3 increase) and immune response (<1 log10 decrease in viral load) were observed in 15.7% and 5.8% of the patients, respectively. We demonstrated that the prevalence of virologic response decreased at week 72 and disappeared after 96 weeks of treatment. This slower response did not correlate with protease inhibitor-based (PI-based) regimens or HCV coinfection. On the other hand, immune response in our cohort could be easily attributable to a simple mechanism, i.e. irregular treatment compliance."
6693,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection causes a severe T-cell impairment with alteration of immune response. However, in children the natural decline of lymphocytes and CD4 cells in early life makes it more difficult to monitor immunocompetence and progression of HIV-infection. Aim of this study was to characterize the CD8 response in non-vertically HIV-infected children exposed persistently to viremia and in HIV-infected children controlling efficiently viremia by ART, by analysing the effect of persistent viremia on CD4 and CD8 T-cells count, HIV-specific immune-response and naive/memory pattern of CD8 T-cell. Whereas, no differences of CD4 count between viremic patients and viral controllers were observed (1046.9 +/- 472.1 cells/microl vs 1101.3 +/- 415.4 cells/microl; p > 0.05), CD8 count was higher in the viremic patients (1080.6 +/- 652.1 cells/microl vs 747.5 +/- 389.9 cells/microl, p < 0.05). In viremic patients, HIV-specific CD8 T-cells correlated with viral load. However, in this group a loss of HIV-specific CD8 response was associated with a 7 fold decrease of naïve and increase of pre-effector CD8 T-cells (62.8% +/- 10.21% vs 10.37% +/- 7.91%, p < 0.03). Persistent exposure to viremia alters HIV-specific CD8 response possibly through a persistent immune activation process leading to exhaustion of naive CD8 T-cells and skewed maturation of memory subset. Therefore, memory CD8 T-cells might lose the ability to respond correctly and efficiently to HIV-antigen exposure."
8314,0.001,1.0000,"The importance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level as a surrogate marker for viral load and a predictor of treatment response remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum HBsAg correlates with serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA during peginterferon (PEG-IFN) α-2a treatment (with or without thymosin α-1) in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B patients and whether it can predict treatment response. Sera from 37 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients receiving 48-weeks PEG-IFN α-2a with (n = 20) or without (n = 17) an initial 12-weeks thymosin α-1 were obtained at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 (end of treatment), 56, 72, 84, and 96 (end of follow-up). Taqman HBV DNA tests (Roche) and Architect HBsAg QT (Abbott) were performed. There was a moderate correlation between the HBsAg and HBV DNA levels (r = 0.452, P < 0.001). Median HBsAg levels at baseline and at week 96 were 6,218 IU/ml and 4,038 IU/ml, respectively. The mean HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 7.48 log(10) IU/ml and 173 IU/L at baseline and 5.37 log(10) IU/ml and 102 IU/L at week 96, respectively. A decrease to <60% of baseline levels of HBsAg at week 12 was identified as an independent predictive factor for HBeAg seroconversion (OR = 45.7, P < 0.05) at week 96. Serum HBsAg levels may be helpful for predicting the response to PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients."
1061,0.001,1.0000,"The association of antiretroviral agents plus interleukin 2 (IL-2) represents an efficient approach to the treatment of HIV+ subjects. While the effects of IL-2 on the immune system have been investigated, little is known concerning its impact on HIV dynamics. Two antiretroviral drugs control HIV viremia, but have minimal effects on the proviral load, a predictor of disease progression and response to therapy. The aim of this study was to define the effect of rIL-2 on HIV proviral copy numbers and its relationship to changes in CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. Twelve HIV+ patients with CD4 cell counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3 were treated with six cycles of subcutaneous rIL-2, in combination with zidovudine and didanosine. This regimen resulted in a rapid and durable decrease in proviral load in the peripheral blood, in an increase in CD8+ lymphocytes, and in the emergence of a CD4+CD45RA+ T subset. These results demonstrate that the rationale for IL-2 administration to HIV+ patients may depend not only on its effects on the immune system, but also on the reduction of the number of infected cells, reinforcing the notion that IL-2 can have a favorable impact on the natural history of HIV infection."
8175,0.001,1.0000,"The efficacy of lamivudine for HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) Chinese patients has not been fully investigated. The role of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype on the treatment effect of lamivudine is controversial. Thirty-two consecutive patients with HBeAg-negative CHB were enrolled. All patients were treated with lamivudine 100 mg once daily of 7-12 months duration. The mean total period of follow-up since entry for all patients was 24 +/- 3.5 months. HBV genotypes were classified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and verified by sequencing. Precore (G1896A) and basic core promoter (BCP, A1762T & G1764A) mutations were determined by PCR and direct sequencing. Twenty-one (65.6%) patients were infected by genotype B and, 11 (34.4%) by genotype C. G1896A was predominant in genotype B infected patients (95.2%vs 63.6%, P = 0.037). At the end of treatment, 31 (96.8%) and 14 (43.8%) patients achieved biochemical and virological responses, respectively. The biochemical and virological response rates were 40.6 and 0% at 12 months after treatment. Eighteen (56.3%) patients had biochemical relapse within 12 months after withdrawal of lamivudine. By multivariate analysis, the pretreatment serum level of HBV DNA >/=12 Meq/mL was the only factor associated with early biochemical relapse (Odds ratio = 9.333, 95% CI = 1.497 approximately 58.197, P = 0.017). In conclusion, the virological effect of lamivudine for HBeAg-negative CHB is transient. Most patients had biochemical relapse within 12 months after lamivudine treatment regardless of HBV genotype. A high pretreatment viral load is the determinant for early biochemical relapse."
7911,0.001,1.0000,"Telbivudine (LdT) has demonstrated potent antiviral activity in nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-naïve chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB), but data on its efficacy in NA-experienced patients are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of LdT in hepatitis B e antigen-positive CHB patients with poor response to initial adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). Forty-two CHB patients with HBV DNA > 4 log10  copies/mL after 12 months of ADV monotherapy were enroled in the study and thereafter treated with LdT 600 mg daily for 18 months. Telbivudine led to a rapid decrease in viral load, and viral replication was persistently suppressed with a reduction of 2.26 log10  copies/mL 18 months after LdT treatment. The rates corresponding to virological and biochemical response at the end of observation were 97.6% (41/42) and 65.8% (25/38), respectively. HBeAg loss was found in 30.8% (12/39) of patients, while HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion was found in 17.9% (7/39). Only one patient was detected to have LdT-associated mutation, and no severe adverse events were reported. Optimization therapy with LdT monotherapy may be a good choice for CHB patients with poor response to ADV, and switching to LdT may be the most cost-effective rescue therapeutic strategy for patients with poor response to initial ADV monotherapy."
3837,0.001,1.0000,"Prophylactic zidovudine (ZDV) therapy was evaluated in the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-inoculated cat model for HIV-1 infection in humans. ZDV treatment (30 mg/kg/day via continuous subcutaneous infusion) was initiated 48 h prior to virus inoculation and continued for 28 days. Transient plasma antigenemia evident in six of six untreated cats at week 2 post-inoculation (pi) was absent in the ZDV-treated cats although at 10 and 14 weeks pi (6 and 10 weeks after drug treatment), one of the ZDV-treated cats had low-level antigenemia. Both CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte numbers were consistently higher in the ZDV-treated cats when compared to both the FIV-inoculated untreated cats and the virus-naive, age-matched controls. CD4:CD8 ratios were lower for the ZDV-treated cats than either the FIV-inoculated untreated or virus-naive, control cats. The decreased CD4:CD8 ratios were the result of an increase in CD8 lymphocytes in the ZDV-treated cats while decreased ratios in the FIV-inoculated untreated cats were due to cell loss. Both ZDV-treated and untreated cats showed nearly identical FIV-specific antibody responses beginning 2 weeks pi. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from blood lymphocytes showed that six of six ZDV-treated and six of six untreated cats were positive for FIV-specific gag sequences. Although primary infection was not prevented, these results suggest that prophylactic ZDV therapy deterred early systemic spread of infection mediated by viremia and delayed absolute CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte decline."
469,0.001,1.0000,"The implementation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening tests has significantly enhanced blood transfusion safety. However, the transmission of HBsAg-negative blood components can still occur in the acute phase of infection during the seronegative window period or during chronic stages of infection such as occult hepatitis virus B infection (OBI). OBI, characterized by the presence of HBV infection without detectable HBsAg, is capable to elude the routine detection with HBV serologic markers and harbor a potential risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion or organ transplantation. Here, we test the hypothesis that OBI patients have a differentially expressed profile of microRNA (miRNA) in serum, and this unique serum miRNA signature can serve as a biomarker to detect OBI. Employing TaqMan probe-based quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we assessed the expression level of miRNAs in serum samples. To control for miRNA quantitation, we added an exogenous plant miRNA, MIR156a, into the samples before RNA extraction and used it as an internal control. After screening 13 previously identified HBV-specific serum miRNAs, we obtained four miRNAs, let-7c, miR-23b, miR-122, and miR-150, which are differentially expressed in OBI sera compared to healthy control sera. This 4-serum miRNA signature shows a high level of accuracy in discriminating both OBI (AUC = 0.999) and HBV (AUC = 0.989) cases from the non-infected controls. Cluster analysis also demonstrates that this 4-miRNA signature can clearly separate OBI patients from the control group. Our results demonstrate for the first time that a profile of serum miRNAs can serve as a sensitive and accurate biomarker for OBI detection."

Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."

PBMC derived from 11 HIV-1-infected asymptomatic adults were cultured with a stimulus of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 36 h prior to lysing the cells for PCR. In all 11 patients studied, the intensity of PCR-assisted HIV RNA amplification (RNA-PCR) performed on stimulated cells was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that obtained on unstimulated cells. A comparison of conventional PCR-assisted DNA amplification (DNA-PCR) with that of RNA-PCR was made on seven patients. The sensitivity of DNA-PCR was also increased by prior stimulation of cells, although not to the same extent as was observed for RNA-PCR. The results of our study indicate that the sensitivity of PCR can be significantly enhanced by prior activation of cells with PHA and PMA."
3787,0.001,1.0000,"In chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients, T helper 17 (Th17) cells are significantly elevated. Th17 cells initiate immune‑mediated pathogenesis and have a critical role in the process of HBV‑related liver cirrhosis (HBV‑LC). The mechanisms underlying this process are attributed to Th17‑secreted cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22; however, a systemic analysis regarding these mechanisms has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC. All randomized clinical trials, case series, case reports and meta‑analyses that contained the aforementioned keywords were included in the review process. In addition, unpublished information from the Food and Drug Administration was included. The findings indicated that Th17‑secreted cytokines, including IL‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22, function by activating or silencing hepatic stellate cells, modulating proinflammatory and pro‑ or antifibrogenic effectors, regulating extracellular matrix formation, upregulating chemokine expression, and inducing hepatocellular damage or hepatoprotection during the HBV‑LC process. In addition, Th17 cells and Th17‑secreted cytokines may be considered a potential tool in the diagnosis or treatment of HBV‑LC. The present review summarized the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC in order to deepen the clinical understanding of the role of Th17 cells and also to support the development of effective therapies for patients with HBV‑LC."

Chronic HIV‑1 infection is associated with dysregulated inflammation. Recepteur d'origine nantais (RON) is expressed in tissue resident macrophages and functions to maintain inflammatory homeostasis. The present study aimed to compare the expression of RON on HIV-positive and -negative participants, and to investigate the mechanism by which HIV‑1 influences the expression and function of RON in the JLTRG T cell line. The levels of RON and the RON ligand, macrophage‑stimulating protein (MSP), in the peripheral blood of HIV‑1-positive patients that were receiving (n=22) or not receiving highly active anti‑retroviral therapy (HAART) (n=82) and 37 healthy control participants were determined by enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of RON and MSP in the JLTRG T cell line was assessed by western blotting and the subcellular location was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. JLTRG cells were co‑cultured with a cell line that stably expresses HIV, H9/HTLV‑IIIB, and alterations in the levels of RON and nuclear factor‑κB (NF‑κB) in JLTRG cells were assessed by western blotting. The expression of RON and MSP were significantly different in the serum of HIV‑1-positive patients that were receiving HAART compared with those not receiving HAART (P<0.05) and healthy control patients (P<0.01). RON was detected in JLTRG cells, and was shown to be downregulated by HIV‑1 infection. HIV‑1 infection of JLTRG cells also reduced NF‑κB phosphorylation. Thus, HIV‑1 was shown to downregulate the expression and phosphorylation of RON by targeting the NF‑κB pathway. "
3468,0.001,1.0000,"Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is the natural ligand that recognizes CXCR4, which also serves as a coreceptor for some strains of HIV-1. In this study, we explored SDF-1 blood levels among HIV-1-infected individuals exhibiting a wide range of CD4+ cell counts. Plasma or serum concentrations of SDF-1 protein were measured by ELISA in samples from 31 HIV-1-seronegative individuals and 79 HIV-1-infected subjects. Although SDF-1 protein levels were stable for months among seronegative individuals (mean intrasubject variation, 17%), the absolute values varied widely (0.28 to 106.5 ng/ml; mean, 25.6 ng/ml). In HIV-1-infected subjects, there was a direct correlation between SDF-1 level and CD4+ cell count. Subjects with fewer than 50 CD4+ cells per cubic microliter of blood had significantly lower mean SDF-1 levels (+/-SD) than did either HIV-1-infected subjects with higher CD4+ cell counts or uninfected controls: CD4+ cell count <50, mean SDF-1 level of 10.7+/-33.7, 50 < CD4+ cell count <200, mean SDF-1 level of 12.9+/-19.0, 200 < CD4+ cell count <500, mean SDF-1 level of 19.3+/-36.8; CD4+ cell count >500, mean SDF-1 level of 18.5+/-25.2; uninfected control mean SDF-1 level, 25.6+/-34.7. No significant change in SDF-1 level was detected after administration of antiretroviral therapy in nine subjects with advanced disease (mean intrasubject variation, 43%). Analysis of SDF-1 mRNA expression in lymph nodes from HIV-1-infected subjects at different disease stages revealed that the medullary cords contained stromal cells that express SDF-1 mRNA. This preliminary analysis suggests a possible link between lower SDF-1 levels and disease progression."
2991,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
6641,0.001,1.0000,"Considering the changes antiretroviral therapy (ART) has brought to the treatment of HIV infection, the current clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV/AIDS individuals referred to oral health centers are crucially important in instructing dentists about the oral health management of these patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases.

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
7423,0.001,1.0000,"The primary goal when devising strategies to define the start of therapy in HIV infected individuals is to avoid HIV disease progression and toxicity from antiretroviral therapy (ART). Intermediate goals includes, avoiding resistance by suppressing HIV replication, reducing transmission, limiting spread and diversity of HIV within the body and protecting the immune system from harm. The question of how early or late to start ART and achieve both primary and intermediate goals has dominated HIV research. The distinction between early and late treatment of HIV infection is currently a matter of CD4+ T cells count, a marker of immune status, rather than on viral load, a marker of virus replication. Discussions about respective benefits of early or delayed therapy, as well as the best CD4+ T cell threshold during the course of HIV infection at which ART is initiated remains inconclusive. Guidelines issued by various agencies, provide different initiation recommendations. This can be confusing for clinicians and policy-makers when determining the best time to initiate therapy. Optimizing ART initiation strategies are clearly complex and must be balanced between individual and broader public health needs. This review assesses available data that contributes to the debate on optimal time to initiate therapy in HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals. We also review reports on CD4+ T cell threshold to guide initiation of ART and finally discuss arguments for and against early or late initiation of ART. "
3338,0.001,1.0000,"We assessed the factors that influenced improvement or progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."
7701,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the responsible agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a multi system disorder including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is an immunological privileged site providing a sanctuary and reservoir for HIV-1. Monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a strong reduction of HAD incidence, the prevalence of minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears rising among AIDS patients. Various factors including toxicity, insurgence of drug resistance and sometimes limited access to HAART, contribute to this phenomenon. Independent evolution of drug resistance mutations in several areas of the CNS may emerge as consequence of incomplete suppression of HIV-1, probably related to poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into CNS. The emergence of resistant virus in the CNS may considerable influence the outcome of neurological disease and also the reseeding of HIV-1 in the systemic circulation upon failure of therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CNS injury in HIV-1 infection and will focus on the effects of HAART on CNS."
9390,0.001,1.0000,"Correlates of resistance to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are important for defining potential therapeutic interventions and for prophylactic vaccination. In this study, 11 couples discordant in their HIV-1 infection status were prospectively evaluated for the presence of protective factors. Behavioral characteristics of all subjects entailed a high risk of transmission. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viruses isolated from the infected partner, and against laboratory virus isolates, were detected in 5 (45%) of 11 HIV-negative partners, including a CCR5Delta32-homozygous and a heterozygous subject. No CTL responses were observed in 6 control unexposed subjects. Marked variation in lymphocyte susceptibility to viral infection was noted. Resistance attributable to major histocompatibility complex discordance or anti-major histocompatibility complex antibodies was not identified. These results suggest that a combination of factors, including cellular immunity, viral characteristics, and coreceptor integrity, may be involved in the persistent nontransmission of HIV."
1334,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known about factors involved in virological response to treatment changes guided by genotyping in patients whose highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) fails. A 12-month observational study was conducted of 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, who underwent a new genotype-guided HAART regimen following virological treatment failure. Logistic regression models were used to define factors predictive of virological response to genotype-assisted treatment switches. Virological response was defined as achievement of a level of plasma HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL at the end of the follow-up. Drug-resistance mutations were detected at baseline in 30 patients (66.7%). A sustained virological response to new treatment occurred in 13 (43.3%) of these, as opposed to 11 (73.3%) of the 15 patients harboring drug-susceptible virus at baseline (P=.07). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of drug classes where there was resistance at baseline was the only independent predictor of virological failure (P=.0313). Lack of virological response to genotype-guided treatment changes is primarily due to complex baseline resistance patterns. Benefits of antiretroviral resistance testing may be seriously limited by the lack of subsequent treatment options for heavily pretreated patients."
6450,0.001,1.0000,"HIV/AIDS remains one of the most serious public health problems in Thailand. This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."
638,0.001,1.0000,"The present study was undertaken to screen the molecular epidemiology of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) in Northeast India (NEI) who are ethnically distinct, tribal dominated and of lower socio-economic status with almost no information available from NEI on these aspects. Briefly, 3 ml blood was collected from 324 random liver disease cases with jaundice, receiving care at Central Hospital, N.F. Railway, Guwahati, Assam with informed consent. The patients detected with HAV-IgM positive status were included and were stratified as acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and fulminant hepatitis (FHF) based on clinical profile. Viral RNA was isolated and HAV-RNA was detected by Real-time PCR using primers for the VP3-VP1 region. HAV genotyping was studied by PCR-direct sequencing-phylogenetic analysis approach using the VP1/2A region of HAV isolates. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS13.0 software. A total of 69 cases were HAV infected with two HBV co-infected cases (n = 69 + 2 = 71), 62 cases and two co-infected cases were AVH and others were FHF cases. HAV infection was predominant in especially in the young and adult age group. HAV-RNA was detected in 28 cases, out of which 19 cases could be genotyped (12 AVH, 7 FHF); which showed the prevalence of genotype IIIA or IA only. Although HAV genotype IIIA was the major genotype in both the AVH (10/12, 83.33%) and FHF (5/7, 71.43%) group, but the difference in distribution of genotypes in AVH and FHF cases was statistically non-significant (P = 0.550). HAV genotype IIIA is associated with the majority of HAV infected cases and severity in NEI."
7547,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to assess the reliability, validity and responsiveness of a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument, the Medical Outcomes Short-Form 20-Item General Health Survey (MOS SF-20), in a sample of women with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."
8295,0.001,1.0000,"This study evaluated risk factors associated with prevalent HIV-1 infection among pregnant women in a semi-rural but densely populated area surrounding the town of Butare in Rwanda. Overall seroprevalence was 9.3% in 5690 pregnant women who sought antenatal care at one of five health centres. Factors associated with higher seroprevalence of HIV-1 included history of multiple sexual partners, history of at least one sexually transmitted disease (STD), relatively high socioeconomic status (SES), being unmarried, young age at first pregnancy, and low gravidity. Women who had used oral contraceptives, smoked more than one cigarette per day, whose partners were circumcised, and had had sex to support themselves were also at higher risk of being infected. A history of blood transfusion in the past 5 years was not associated with HIV-1 infection. History of multiple sexual partners, history of STD, high household income, partner circumcision, and past oral contraceptive use remained strongly associated with HIV-1 infection even when simultaneously controlling for other covariates. Among legally married women who lacked sexual behaviour risk factors, history of STD, high SES, young age at first pregnancy, and low gravidity were significantly associated with HIV-1 seroprevalence."
6576,0.001,1.0000,"Previous studies have identified gaps in hepatitis B care. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delivery of care among a national cohort of US veterans with chronic hepatitis B infection and examine risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from 1999 to 2013 to evaluate (1) care delivery and (2) clinical outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and mortality among US veterans with hepatitis B. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and Cox regression models were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. We identified 21,419 veterans with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, and 97% of patients had alanine aminotransferase and 44% had hepatitis B virus DNA testing; hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B e antibody were tested <50% of the time. Patients receiving specialty care had a higher prevalence of recommended laboratory testing. Patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase in specialty care were more likely to receive antiviral therapy (50% versus 24% for specialty care versus no specialty care, P < 0.001). Among patients with cirrhosis, 69% received one-time liver imaging. The proportion of follow-up time adherent to annual imaging was 0.39 (standard deviation = 0.42), and the proportion was 0.28 (standard deviation = 0.33) for biannual imaging; both proportions were higher in the specialty care group (all P < 0.05). Antiviral therapy (hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.95, P = 0.005) and liver imaging (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.91, P < 0.001) were independently associated with decreased mortality in adjusted analyses."
3630,0.001,1.0000,"The AIDS epidemic has become one of the most important public health problems of this century. As the prevalence of HIV infection continues to rise, health care practitioners in all geographic regions can expect greater clinical exposure to patients infected with HIV. We conducted an anonymous survey of all practicing otolaryngologists in Ohio and California to investigate regional differences in attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding the care of patients infected with HIV. We also examined the data with respect to year of completion of residency training to identify differences in attitudes or practices among otolaryngologists who trained in the era of AIDS (post-1982 graduates) in comparison with their predecessors (pre-1982 graduates). In comparison with Ohio otolaryngologists, California otolaryngologists reported more frequent clinical encounters with HIV-infected patients and displayed significantly better knowledge regarding the otolaryngologic aspects of HIV infection. Californians were more likely to support the right of an HIV-infected physician to maintain an unrestricted practice and would be less likely to disclose their HIV status to their patients and hospital if they were to become infected with HIV. Post-1982 graduates had more frequent encounters with HIV-infected patients than did pre-1982 graduates and demonstrated a better fund of knowledge. Although Californians were more likely than Ohioans to routinely double glove in surgery, the overall double gloving rate was low at 21%. Californians were no more likely than Ohioans to routinely use protective eyewear, water-impervious gowns, or indirect instrument-passing techniques in surgery. No differences were observed in prevalence of protective surgical precautions between pre-1982 and post-1982 graduates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
2357,0.001,1.0000,"VprR77Q has been associated with long-term nonprogressive (LTNP) HIV infection. We wished to investigate the prevalence, clinical correlates, and effect on treatment response of VprR77Q in a cohort of antiretroviral- naïve individuals initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Baseline plasma samples from 728 subjects were genotyped using RT-PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the effects of VprR77Q on virologic and immunologic responses, and survival following initiation of HAART, over a median 4.5 years follow-up. We found that 308 subjects (42.3%) harbored VprR77Q alone or in combination with another amino acid, while 420 (57.7%) harbored an amino acid other than Q. A cross-sectional analysis found no correlation between R77Q and baseline plasma viral load (pVL), CD4 count, diagnosis of AIDS, or sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, and history of injection drug use (p > 0.1). In multivariate analyses, no significant associations between VprR77Q and initial pVL and CD4 responses to HAART or survival following initiation of treatment were observed (p > 0.1). The high prevalence and the lack of association with pretherapy clinical parameters in this cohort argue against an association of R77Q with LTNP status. These results do not support an association between R77Q and HAART response."
2902,0.001,1.0000,"Although co-infection of tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites, including protozoa and helminths, in humans has been widely studied globally, very little of this phenomenon is known in China. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural county of China to investigate such co-infections. Patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) undergoing anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis (anti-MTB) treatment were surveyed by questionnaires, and their feces and blood specimens were collected for detection of intestinal protozoa and helminths, routine blood examination and HIV detection. The χ(2) test and multivariate logistic regression model were used to identify risk factors. A total of 369 patients with PTB were included and all of them were HIV negative. Overall, only 7.3% of participants were infected with intestinal protozoa, among which prevalence of Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba spp. and Trichomonas hominis were 6.0%, 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively; 7.0% were infected with intestinal helminths, among which prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and Clonorchis sinensis were 4.3%, 1.9%, 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively; and 0.5% were simultaneously infected with intestinal protozoa and helminths. Among patients with PTB, body mass index (BMI)≤18 (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.44-7.54) and raised poultry or livestock (e.g., chicken, duck, pig) (OR=3.96, 95% CI=1.32-11.89) were significantly associated with harboring intestinal protozoan infection, while BMI≤18 (OR=3.32, 95% CI=1.39-7.91), anemia (OR=3.40, 95% CI=1.44-8.02) and laboring barefoot in farmlands (OR=4.54, 95% CI=1.88-10.92) were significantly associated with having intestinal helminth infection. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between duration of anti-MTB treatment and infection rates of intestinal parasites including protozoa and helminths. Therefore, preventing malnutrition, avoiding unprotected contact with reservoirs of protozoa, and improving health education for good hygiene habits, particularly wearing shoes while outdoors, are beneficial in the prevention of intestinal protozoan and helminth infection among patients with PTB.

7313,0.001,1.0000,"Shandong province has been providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eligible HIV/AIDS patients since 2003 using first-line regimens. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess virological response and resistance development from ART patients. Between 2006 and 2008, blood was collected from 143 ART patients. Viral load (VL) was determined with a detection limit of 50 copies/ml; those with detectable VL were genotyped with dried plasma spots using a broadly sensitive genotyping assay. Resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Of the 143 patients, 72% [95% confidence interval (CI): 65.9-78.2] suppressed their VL to <50 copies/ml. Genotyping analysis of the remaining 40 patients revealed that 21 (53%, CI: 37.0-68.0) harbored one or more mutations. The most common mutations were thymidine-analog mutations (22.5%) and M184V (10%) to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and V106I/A /M (17.5%), Y181C (15%), and H221Y (12.5%) to non-NRTIs (NNRTIs); 13 patients had mutations to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. Patients with VL >1000 copies/ml appear to harbor more mutations than those with VL between 50 and 1000 (62.1% vs. 27.3%, p>0.05). Resistance mutations were intensified among 10 patients for whom two sequential specimens were obtained and accumulation of resistance mutations predicted compromised treatment outcomes and future drug selections. This study provides a snapshot of the virological responses and resistance profiles for patients on first-line regimens, indicating that patient monitoring is a critical component in preventing the accumulation of resistance mutations among patients failing their regimens and thus maintaining the effectiveness of the first-line regimens."
8165,0.001,1.0000,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."
7948,0.001,1.0000,"We examined the emergence of CXCR4 (i.e., X4) tropism in 67 male human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who were selected to reflect the full spectrum of rates of HIV-1 disease progression. A mean of 10 serial samples per donor were evaluated by a laboratory-validated, commercially available assay to determine phenotypic coreceptor use. A total of 52% of men had dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1 detected at 1 or more of the time points tested. Use of X4 by HIV-1 was detected more frequently among men who developed AIDS (defined as a CD4(+) T cell count of <200 cells/muL and/or an AIDS-defining illness) < or =11 years after seroconversion than among those who did not (P = .005), as well as among men who exhibited a total T cell count decline (i.e., a CD3(+) inflection point), compared with those who did not (P = .03). For men in whom both X4 virus and an inflection point were detected, emergence of X4 virus preceded the inflection point by a median of 0.83 years. The median CD4(+) T cell count at first detection of X4 viruses before the onset of AIDS was 475 cells/microL. We conclude that HIV-1 variants that used X4 frequently emerged at high CD4(+) T cell counts and may contribute to the decrease in T cell numbers during late HIV-1 infection."
7417,0.001,1.0000,"In Hungary over the past 5 years more than thousand patients with chronic viral hepatitis have been examined and included in a treatment program with interferon (IFN) at 16 major hepatology centers, using unified diagnostic and therapeutical criteria. Authors give an account of their experiences on the clinical features of patients with chronic viral hepatitis and report the results of the treatment with IFN. According to the rules and availability of IFN for patients with chronic viral hepatitis in the country, virtually the entire Hungarian population with this diseases who required IFN therapy have been included. A total of 94 patients suffered from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in addition 11 HBV + hepatitis Delta virus (HDV), 24 HBV + Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver disease, and 993 had chronic hepatitis C. IFN therapy for chronic HBV hepatitis consisted of IFN 5 MU thrice weekly for 6 months, and resulted in 33% seroconversion and sustained remission with 14% HBsAg clearance. For chronic hepatitis C treatment protocols (dose of IFN and duration of therapy) have changed with the time (from a weekly dose of 3 x 3 MU IFN for 6 months, to 3 x 3 MU for 12 months), and even a combination with ribavirin has been introduced. Although the therapeutic results showed a gradual improvement form a 13% sustained response over 22% in the first and second periods, respectively, differences were most significant with the advent of the combination therapy, that resulted in 36% remission rate. Only fibrosis in histology and baseline pretreatment HCV-RNA level appeared as predictors of response in chronic hepatitis C. Neither age nor gender did influence the outcome, but longer duration of treatment and higher total dose of IFN resulted moderately higher sustained remission rates. The experiences are in accordance with findings of suboptimal efficacy of IFN monotherapy reported worldwide and emphasize the need of seeking for newer and combination therapeutic modalities for these chronic viral diseases."
17,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of newborn rhesus macaques is a useful animal model of human immunodeficiency virus infection for the study of the emergence and clinical implications of drug-resistant viral mutants. We previously demonstrated that SIV-infected infant macaques receiving prolonged treatment with 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) developed viral mutants with fivefold reduced susceptibility to PMPA in vitro and that the development of these mutants was associated with the development of a K65R mutation and additional compensatory mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT). To study directly the virulence and clinical implications of these SIV mutants, two uncloned SIVmac isolates with similar fivefold reduced in vitro susceptibilities to PMPA but distinct RT genotypes, SIVmac055 (K65R, N69T, R82K A158S,S211N) and SIVmac385 (K65R, N69S, I118V), were each inoculated intravenously into six newborn rhesus macaques; 3 weeks later, three animals of each group were started on PMPA treatment. All six untreated animals developed persistently high levels of viremia and fatal immunodeficiency within 4 months. In contrast, the six PMPA-treated animals, despite having persistently high virus levels, survived significantly longer: 5 to 9 months for the three SIVmac055-infected infants and > or = 21 months for the three SIVmac385-infected infants. Virus from only one untreated animal demonstrated reversion to wild-type susceptibility and loss of the K65R mutation. In several other animals, additional RT mutations, including K64R and Y115F, were detected, but the biological role of these mutations is unclear since they did not affect the in vitro susceptibility of the virus to PMPA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that although SIVmac mutants with the PMPA-selected K65R mutation in RT were highly virulent, PMPA treatment still offered strong therapeutic benefits. These results suggest that the potential emergence of HIV mutants with reduced susceptibility to PMPA in patients during prolonged PMPA therapy may not eliminate its therapeutic benefits."
7226,0.001,1.0000,"In humans, the interaction of the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D)-activating receptor on natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells with its major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MIC) and UL16 binding protein (ULBP) ligands (NKG2DLs) promotes recognition and elimination of stressed cells, such as tumor or infected cells. Here, we investigated the capacity of HIV-1 to modulate NKG2DL expression and escape NGK2D-mediated immunosurveillance. In CD4(+) T lymphocytes, both cell surface expression and release of MICA, MICB, and ULBP2 were up-regulated >2-fold by HIV-1 infection. In HIV-infected CD4(+) T lymphocytes or Jurkat T-cell lines, increased shedding of soluble NKG2DLs (sNKG2DLs) was impaired by a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI). Moreover, naive HIV(+) patients displayed increased plasma sMICA and sULBP2 levels and reduced NKG2D expression on NK and CD8(+) T cells compared to patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or healthy donors. In individual patients, HAART uptake resulted in the drop of sNKG2DL and recovery of NKG2D expression. Finally, sNKG2DLs in patients' plasma down-regulated NKG2D on NK and CD8(+) T cells and impaired NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells. Thus, NKG2D detuning by sNKG2DLs may promote HIV-1 immune evasion and compromise host resistance to opportunistic infections, but HAART and MMPI have the potential to avoid such immune dysfunction."
8345,0.001,1.0000,"Because T cell responses are critical for defense against viral infections, a series of synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequence for HIV-1 proteins gp41, pg120, gag, and viral polymerase were used to test the T cell proliferative response of HIV-1 seropositive individuals. Of HIV-1-infected donors from various clinical categories 90% (27/30) had sensitized cells that proliferated in response to at least one of 21 HIV peptides tested. Cells from HIV seronegative controls did not proliferate (0/9) in response to these HIV peptides. Individuals with fewer clinical manifestations of HIV-1 disease responded to a greater number of peptides (average for asymptomatic seropositives = 8.1 peptides; AIDS patients averaged 2.0). The number of peptides recognized also correlated with absolute number of CD4+ cells, but not with delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to a (non-HIV) battery of Ag. However, clinical stage at no time correlated with the response to any particular peptide. Response patterns differed considerably among individuals, and some peptides stimulated proliferation in many (48%) HIV-infected donors (peptides gp41-2 and pol-3), whereas another peptide elicited no T cell response in any donor tested (peptide gp120-8). We have also begun to investigate the basis for individual heterogeneity of T lymphocyte proliferative responses of HIV-infected donors to the 21 HIV synthetic peptides. Peptide structure and HLA class II determinants both influenced patterns of lymphocyte responses. Reactivity correlated with peptide size, the presence of alpha and beta secondary structure and lack of reverse turn potential. Hydropathy and charge had no predictive value. Peptides derived from HIV sequences that vary highly among strains tended to be recognized less frequently. HIV-infected lymphocyte donors were HLA typed to examine the influence of the MHC on T lymphocyte proliferation. Analysis of the frequencies of individuals reacting to specific peptides, when compared to the allele frequencies in the population at large, indicated association of some responses to DR alleles. More DR association was observed with peptides that showed ""moderate"" reactivity than with those that were ""highly"" reactive. We suggest that highly reactive peptides are capable of forming a structure closer to an ""ideal"" T cell epitope that can associate with many DR alleles. In contrast, ""moderately"" reactive determinants have less favorable structures for interaction, are more limited in their ability to interact and therefore show more restriction to specific class II alleles."

The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
2,0.001,1.0000,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a proteinase which activates plasminogen by cleaving at -CPGR(arrow downward)V-, was shown to cleave the V3 loop in recombinant gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IIIB and MN strains, as well as a synthetic, cyclized peptide representing the clade B consensus sequence of V3. Proteolysis occurred at the homologous -GPGR(arrow downward)A-, an important neutralizing determinant of HIV-1. It required soluble CD4 and was prevented by inhibitors of uPA but not by inhibitors of likely contaminating plasma proteinases. It was accelerated by heparin, a known cofactor for plasminogen activation. In immune capture experiments, tight binding of uPA to viral particles, which did not depend on CD4, was also demonstrated. Active site-directed inhibitors or uPA diminished this binding, as did a neutralizing antibody to V3. Addition of exogenous uPA to the laboratory-adapted IIIB strain of HIV-1, the macrophage-tropic field strains JR-CSF and SF-162, or a fresh patient isolate of indeterminate tropism, followed by infection of macrophages with the various treated viruses, resulted in severalfold increases in subsequent viral replication, as judged by yields of reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen, as well as incorporation, as judged by PCR in situ. These responses were reversible by inhibitors or antibodies targeting the proteinase active site or the V3 loop. We propose that uPA, a transcriptionally regulated proteinase which is upregulated when macrophages are HIV infected, can be bound and utilized by the virus to aid in fusion and may be an endogenous component that is critical to the infection of macrophages by HIV-1."

The clonality of the T-cell compartment and the abundance of RTEs (Recent Thymic Emigrants) were determined 2 weeks before and 20 weeks after initiation of HAART in a subgroup of children taking part in the PENTA (Paediatric European Network for the Treatment of AIDS) 5 trial. Analysis of the clonality of the circulating T-cell compartment was assessed using CDR3 spectratyping and analysed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test. This revealed that a high degree of T-cell clonal restriction still exists 5 months into therapy, despite the appearance of previously undetectable T-cell clones within the periphery. We detected no increase in RTE abundance in this 5 month period, as determined by PCR detection of TRECs (T-Cell Receptor Excision Circles). We conclude that the observed re-population of T cells within the periphery of treated children is heavily reliant upon the maintenance/expansion of pre-existing cells during the 5 month period immediately following the initiation of therapy."
1724,0.001,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the potential risk of nelfinavir (NFV) accumulation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients with liver disease, we investigated the concentrations of NFV and M8, the active metabolite of NFV, in plasma HIV-positive (HIV+) patients coinfected with HCV. A total of 119 HIV+ subjects were included in our study: 67 HIV+ patients, 32 HIV+ and HCV-positive (HCV+) patients without cirrhosis, and 20 HIV+ and HCV+ patients with cirrhosis. Most of the enrolled patients (chronically treated) were taking NFV at the standard dosage of 1,250 mg twice a day. To assay plasma NFV and M8 concentrations, patients underwent serial plasma samplings during the dosing interval at steady state. Plasma NFV and M8 concentrations were measured simultaneously by a high-performance liquid chromatography method with UV detection. The HIV+ and HCV+ patients with and without cirrhosis had significantly lower NFV oral clearances than the HIV+ and HCV-negative individuals (28 and 58% lower, respectively; P < 0.05), which translated into higher areas under the concentration-time curves for cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients. The NFV absorption rate was significantly lower in cirrhotic patients, resulting in a longer time to the maximum concentration in serum. The mean ratios of the M8 concentration/NFV concentration were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in HIV+ and HCV+ subjects with cirrhosis (0.06 +/- 0.074) than in the subjects in the other two groups. The mean ratios for M8 and NFV were not statistically different between HIV+ and HCV-negative patients (0.16 +/- 0.13) and HIV+ and HCV+ patients without cirrhosis (0.24 +/- 0.17), but the interpatient variability was high. Our results indicate that the pharmacokinetics of NFV and M8 are altered in HIV+ and HCV+ patients, especially those with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, there may be a role for therapeutic drug monitoring in individualizing the NFV dosage in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients."
10000,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection is common. HIV co-infection results in a higher rate of histologic progression and shorter interval to HCV-related cirrhosis. Successful treatment of HCV with interferon-based therapy reduces the morbidity and mortality of patients. Significant factors may limit the availability of treatment in co-infected patients. The rate of treatment of HCV and limiting factors to treatment in a co-infected population in an urban setting were determined. A retrospective review of co-infected patients was conducted at our liver and gastrointestinal (GI) clinics for treatment of HCV from July 2001 to June 2002. Treatment of HCV and reasons for nontreatment were recorded. A total of 104 HCV/HIV co-infected patients were identified. Seventy-two per cent were males. Mean age was 47.2 years (32-72). Seventy-four of the 82 (90%) with identifiable risk factors for HCV infection had a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU). Twenty per cent (21/104) of the total underwent a liver biopsy. Sixty-seven per cent who had a liver biopsy were treated. Overall, sixteen patients were treated. Eighty-eight (85%) patients were not treated for the following reasons: 13 refused treatment, and 75 were ineligible. Of the ineligible patients, 40% were noncompliant with visits, 15% were active substance abusers, 13% had decompensated cirrhosis, 8% had significant active psychiatric conditions and 24% had significant co-morbid disease. A majority of patients co-infected with HCV/HIV had a IVDU history. Most co-infected patients were not eligible for HCV treatment. A majority of noncandidates had potentially modifiable psychosocial factors leading to nontreatment."
7382,0.001,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection can now be treated effectively in many patients in the developed world, using combinations of antiretroviral therapeutics, called Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). However, despite prolonged treatment with HAART, the persistence of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs harboring transcriptionally silent but replication-competent proviruses represents the major hurdle to virus eradication. These latently infected cells are a permanent source for virus reactivation and lead to a rebound of the viral load after interruption of HAART. Therefore, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating proviral latency and reactivation should lead to rational strategies aimed at purging these cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. This review summarizes our current knowledge and understanding of the elements involved in HIV-1 transcriptional reactivation: (1) the site of integration; (2) the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNFalpha) and binds to two kappaB sites in the HIV-1 promoter region; (3) the specific remodeling of a single nucleosome (called nuc-1 and located immediately downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site under latency conditions) upon activation of the HIV-1 promoter; (4) post-translational acetylation of histones and of non-histone proteins (following treatment with deacetylases inhibitors, which induce viral transcription and nuc-1 remodeling); and (5) the viral trans-activator Tat, which promotes transcription by mediating the recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter of histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes required for nucleosome disruption and transcriptional processivity. Finally, this review highlights experimental therapies aimed at administrating HIV-1 gene expression activators (such as HDAC inhibitors) combined with an effective HAART in order to reactivate and decrease/eliminate the pool of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs"
5036,0.001,1.0000,"We have described a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture system in which control of endogenous virus and resistance to exogenous HIV-1 correlates with low viremia among HIV-1-positive people. Nineteen patients remained consistently resistant or susceptible for more than 5 years of follow-up. On the fifth year, 5 consistently susceptible volunteers with high viral loads began receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). After >6 months on HAART, 5 of 5 became completely or predominantly resistant on four visits over the next 6 months. Among HIV-1-positive donors, we had never observed reversal of PBMC phenotype from consistently susceptible to consistently resistant. Resistance correlated with suppression of plasma viremia and rebound in CD4+ T-cell counts and percentages. When resistant PBMCs were challenged after CD8+ T-cell depletion, 38 of 41 and 40 of 59 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1MN and HIV-1BaL, respectively. After combined CD8+ T-cell depletion and antibody neutralization of beta-chemokines, 16 of 18 cultures became susceptible to HIV-1BaL. Overall, the finding that >90% of these cultures depleted of relevant antiviral effector arms could become infected indicates resistance was not due to residual antiretroviral drug metabolites in vitro. For 2 volunteers who discontinued therapy because of side effects, pretreatment viral load correlated with loss of in vitro resistance and viral rebound. In addition to resistance to laboratory strains of HIV-1, all patients developed resistance to at least one of two CCR5-tropic, clade B primary isolates: HIV-1P15 and HIV-1P27."
3985,0.001,1.0000,"Our objective was to characterize the clinical presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among incarcerated women in a program that provides HIV testing and primary care to all state prisoners in Rhode Island. A retrospective medical chart review on all HIV-seropositive women who were incarcerated between 1989 and 1994 and had at least two medical visits with an HIV medical care provider was used. At the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institution (ACI), under mandatory testing laws between 1989 and 1994, 28% (172 of 623) of all women were identified with HIV infection. Of the 172 women who tested seropositive in prison, 110 were included in the study. Of the 110 women followed, 84% reported injection drug use (IDU) as their primary risk factor, and 30% reported both IDU and sex work. The median CD4 count was 596/mm3, with 60% having a CD4 count >500 cells/mm3. The most common medical conditions were vaginal candidiasis, oral candidiasis, and bronchitis. Antiretroviral therapy was well accepted and followed community standards. Continuity of medical care after release was facilitated by the same physician caring for the patient in the community setting, with 83% of women following up for HIV care after release. The medical conditions noted reflect that these women are early in the course of their HIV disease when they are initially diagnosed. This comprehensive program in Rhode Island's state prison plays a central role in the diagnosis of HIV-seropositive women and provides counseling, primary medical and gynecological care, and linkage to community resources after release."

The Internet both facilitates high-risk sexual encounters and provides opportunities for promoting healthy behaviours. This study compared self-reported HAV and HBV vaccination levels, based on demographics, health characteristics, hepatitis knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviours among MSM using an online survey posted from February through June 2005. Each participant (n = 968) reported whether they were vaccinated, infected or susceptible for hepatitis A and/or for hepatitis B. Men whose health-care provider recommended vaccination were 12.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.11, 20.55) times more likely to be vaccinated against HAV and 17.93 (95% CI 10.82, 29.70) times more likely to be vaccinated against HBV than those at risk of infection, respectively. These data provide essential information for public health professionals to successfully promote vaccination among members of this population."

However, differential susceptibility in institutionalized populations suggest that HCV infection is even more prevalent in prison populations than previously reported yet, routine screening for HCV infection among prisoners is not generally available. We estimated the HCV prevalence and identified associated exposures at two maximum-security prisons using data obtained from 2788 inmates from the Risk Factors for Spread of Staphylococcus aureus in Prisons Study in New York, which recruited participants from January 2009 and January 2013. HCV prevalence was 10.1% (n=295); injection drug use, injection drug use sex partners, and HIV diagnosis exhibited the strongest associations with HCV infection in multivariable models, adjusting for covariates. Taken together, the findings of the present study provide an updated estimate of HCV prevalence and suggest that incarcerated populations represent a declining yet significant portion of the hepatitis epidemic.

8062,0.001,1.0000,"In order to evaluate the frequency of a late clinical stage in HIV infected patients at onset of antiretroviral therapy (LART) and to identify possible associated factors, we performed a retrospective analysis of data reported in two prospective cohorts of HIV infected patients who started antiretroviral therapy for the first time between 2005 and 2009. Medical records of 265 patients -123 women (46.6%) and 141 men, median age 37.7 years old- were analyzed. LART was observed in 132 cases (50%), out of them 102 (77.2%) were associated to late diagnosis of HIV infection and 30 (22.8%) to patients that had not been retained in HIV care. The median of CD4 was 120 cells/ml and that of viral load 58 038 copies/ml. CD4 cells count was below 200 cells/ml in 174 patients (71.3%). There was a higher incidence of LART in men than in women (59.8% and 42.2% respectively). Diagnosis in women took place during pregnancy control in 25:2% of the cases. High alcohol consumption (p 0.006), single hood (p 0.04) and level of education lower than secondary (p 0.008) were associated to LART at bivariate analysis. Male sex (p 0.003) was the only associated factor both in bivariate and multivariate analysis. Our data reinforce the need of expanding HIV testing and should assist programs to define actions promoting early entry in HIV care."

2337,0.001,1.0000,Little is known about recurrent tuberculosis (TB) among HIV-infected patients and the influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
406,0.001,1.0000,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

5546,0.001,1.0000,"People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) are increasingly involved in 'positive prevention' initiatives. These are generally oriented to promoting abstinence, 'being faithful' (partner reduction) and condom use (ABC). We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study with people living with HIV using ART, who were provided with adherence education and counselling support by a Ugandan non-governmental organisation, The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO). Forty people were selected sequentially as they started ART, stratified by sex, ART delivery mode (clinic- or home-based) and HIV progression stage (early or advanced) and interviewed at enrollment and at 3, 6, 18 and 30 months. At initiation of ART, participants agreed to follow TASO's positive-living recommendations. Initially poor health prevented sexual activity. As health improved, participants prioritised resuming economic production and support for their children. With further improvements, sexual desire resurfaced and people in relationships cemented these via sex. The findings highlight the limitations of HIV prevention based on medical care/personal counselling. As ART leads to health improvements, social norms, economic needs and sexual desires increasingly influence sexual behaviour. Positive prevention interventions need to seek to modify normative and economic influences on sexual behaviour, as well as to provide alternatives to condoms."
3666,0.001,1.0000,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and prevalence of TB-HIV co-infection among patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital between August 2008 and July 2009 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Of 387 TB patients included, 117 (30.2%) were in the age group 30-39 years. The overall mean age of patients was 38.1 years (range 8 to 86 years) and 216 (55.8%) were male. Two hundred and five (53%) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 58 (15%) had extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and 124 (32%) had both PTB and EPTB. Common sites of EPTB were pleural cavity 80 (44%), lymph node 31 (17%) and 30 (16.5%) abdomen. Of the 300 TB patients tested for HIV, 175 (58.3%) were HIV-infected and 97 (55.4%) of these were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of admission. Overall, 104 (26.9%) of the TB patients admitted died. About two thirds of patients who died had PTB. About three quarters (73.1%; N=283) of the patients were discharged home to continue with anti-TB treatment. There was significantly higher proportion of deaths among HIV-infected TB patients (29.1% versus 15.2%) than in the HIV uninfected TB patients (P=0.005). Age was a significant predictor for PTB (OR 0.946, 95% CI 0.917-0.976) while age (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.002-1.036) and HIV serostatus (OR 2.143, 95% CI 1.313-3.497) were significant risk factors for EPTB. It is concluded that more than half of the patients had PTB and pleural cavity was the most common site of EPTB. TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly higher mortality than the TB-HIV- uninfected patients. It is recommended to emphasize on the provision of HIV counselling and testing to all TB patients to ensure proper management and timely initiation of ART in TB-HIV co-infected patients in order to improve the outcome and reduce mortality."

Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, drug-induced hepatotoxicity related to combined anti-retro-viral therapy, alcohol related liver disease and non-alcohol related fatty liver disease appear to be the leading causes. It is therefore, anticipated that more HIV-positive patients with ESLD will present as potential transplant candidates. HIV infection is no longer a contraindication to liver transplantation. Key transplantation outcomes such as rejection and infection rates as well as medium term graft and patient survival match those seen in the non-HIV infected patients in the absence of co-existing HCV infection. HIV disease does not seem to be negatively impacted by transplantation. However, HIV-HCV co-infection transplant outcomes remain suboptimal due to recurrence. In this article, we review the key challenges faced by this patient cohort in the pre- and post-transplant period. "

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."

However, defining the potential correlates of effective CD8(+) T-cell immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the CD8(+) T-cell response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral load. Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of CD8(+) T-cell responses to autologous virus in a cohort of six HIV-infected individuals with a history of structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (SIT). The magnitude and breadth of the HIV-specific response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the cessation of ART. Furthermore, mutational escape from targeted epitopes could not account for the differential virological outcomes in this cohort. However, the functionality of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations upon antigen encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five CD8(+) T-cell functions (degranulation and gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 levels) reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being elicited in those individuals with lower levels of viremia after SIT. These data show that the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, rather than the quantity, is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of SIT can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells."

Survival in HIV infected individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has improved since the introduction of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Current experience in renal transplantation in HIV-infected patients in the United States indicates that the three-year survival rate is similar to that of HIV-negative transplant recipients, with virological and immunological control of the infection by HAART and no increase in the number of opportunistic infections or tumors. The criteria for selecting renal transplantation candidates in this population are the following: no aids-defining events, CD4 cells > 200 cells/.l and undetectable viral load under HAART. In Spain, where most of these patients are former drug abusers, a two-year period of abstinence from cocaine and heroine abuse is also required, although patients can be participating in the methadone program. The main problems in the post-transplantation period have been interactions between HAART and immunosuppressive drugs, management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and the high rate of acute rejection. To date, seven such renal transplantations have been performed in Spain, with favorable patient and graft survival and no progression to aids."

Demographic data, drug use characteristics, and biological markers were obtained at the time of admission to a substance abuse treatment program. The outcome of interest was the duration of survival after admission, and the primary exposure was HIV infection. Vital status was ascertained by means of the mortality register by the end of 2004. Three calendar periods, which were defined on the basis of use of specific therapies, were considered: 1987-1991 (the antiretroviral monotherapy era), 1992-1996 (the dual combination therapy era and the era when methadone was introduced in Spain), and 1997-2004 (the era of HAART and of established methadone programs).

Fourteen untreated and 2 treated patients experienced clinical progression (p = 0.09). The difference between baseline CD4 T-cell count and after 3 years, was -240/mm3 in the untreated group +19/mm3 in the HAART group (p < 10(-3)). A better immunological outcome was significantly associated with a HIV sexual contamination (p = 0.01), HAART (p = 0.01), high baseline CD4 T-cell count (p < 10(-3)) and low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.01). In the HAART group, the incidence rate of antiretroviral modification due to tolerance difficulties was 0.23+/-0.36/patient year. A sustained undetectable HIV viral load was correlated with a low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.003) and to be antiretroviral naive (p < 10(-3)). Thus, HAART provide a better immunological outcome in patients with high CD4 T-cell count.

Outcomes in patients who were enrolled in the French Dialysis in HIV/AIDS (DIVA) cohort were determined in a 2-yr prospective follow-up. All HIV-infected patients who were on hemodialysis in France on January 1, 2002, were included and followed prospectively until January 1, 2004. Patients' survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier method, and mortality risk factors were examined using uni- and multicovariate analyses. Survival was compared with that of 584 hemodialysis patients who did not have HIV or diabetes and were enrolled in the French Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) in the same period (after standardization for the average age, gender, and ethnicity of the DIVA cohort). A total of 27,577 patients were receiving hemodialysis in France at the beginning of the study; 164 (0.59%) were infected with HIV, 72% were male, mean age was 44.8 +/- 10.9 yr, and 65% were black. The 2-yr survival rate was 89 +/- 2% and statistically indistinguishable from the survival of the French cohort extracted from the DOPPS II study. Significant mortality risk factors were low CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4/100 CD4 cells per mm(3) lower), high viral load (HR 2.5/1 Log per ml), absence of HAART (HR 2.7), and a history of opportunistic infection (HR 3.7), the last two being independent (HR 2.6 and 3.6, respectively). Survival of HIV-infected patients who are hemodialysis has greatly improved. A prospective cohort of paired hemodialysis patients with and without HIV is required to compare better their mortality in the HAART era."
3174,0.001,1.0000,"The present study aimed to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of HBV in chronic HBV infected cases from northeast India (NEI), since scanty data are available from the region which has a predominant ethnically distinct tribal population. A total of 523 clinically diagnosed index chronic HBV infected cases and 172 asymptomatic patients (based on family screening) were enrolled with informed consent. Patients were stratified based on serology, imaging, pathology, and clinical data and grouped as chronic HBV and cirrhotic cohorts. Analysis for serum HBV DNA levels and HBV genotyping was performed, and was statistically co-related with disease severity. Males were more prone to chronic HBV infection. Majority of the patients who had Chronic HBV infection based on family screening were females (59.88%), majorly wives of index patients. Mean viral load in Chronic HBV patients was almost 4.5-folds higher than cirrhosis patients, and was significantly associated with e-antigen positive status(P < 0.001) in both groups. HBV genotype D was the most prevalent genotype (62.30%) in NEI. Mixed genotype infection of A + D was found from Assam, along with C + D cases (1.29%) cumulatively. There is a high prevalence of HBV genotype C (13.96%) in our studied cohort which was found to be associated with higher viral load(P = 0.018), e-antigen positivity(P = 0.043), and increased cirrhosis risk compared to Chronic HBV cases [OR = 1.670]. Family contacts in NEI are prone to infection with HBV and development of Chronic HBV. Higher presence of e-positive cases and genotype C along with the mixed genotypes in NEI is unique and of significance with reference to predisposition to disease severity and even response to antiviral therapy."
1213,0.001,1.0000,"Immune parameters were studied in 86 haemophilia patients (six with AIDS) and 87 healthy controls. We found lymphocytotoxic alloantibodies in HIV-positive (HIV+) sera which reacted preferentially with B lymphocytes but also with T lymphocytes, and which reacted more frequently at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The antibodies were not directed against HIV-induced structures on T lymphocytes and they were reactive with both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. In addition to cytotoxic alloantibodies, cytotoxic autoantibodies were detected which coated patient lymphocytes in vivo. Increased proportions of in vivo-antibody-coated-cells were found in 37 of 86 haemophilia patients. Antibody binding was labile so that the immunoglobulins were partially removed from the lymphocyte surface by washing. The autoreactive antibodies were of IgG and IgM type, fixed complement as demonstrated by increased anti-C3d+ cells in the patients' blood, and reacted with CD4+ as well as CD8+ lymphocytes. There was a statistically significant correlation of increased Ig+ cells with HIV infection, decreased CD4/CD8 ratios, increased serum neopterin levels, and abnormal in-vitro responses to pooled allogeneic stimulator cells or CD3 monoclonal antibody. Patients with increased Ig+ cells were lymphopenic, had decreased absolute counts of CD4+, CD25+, CD21+ and OKM5+ cells, and higher percentages of CD8+ and OKIa1+ cells in their blood than patients with normal levels of Ig+ cells. Our data suggest a role of autoreactive anti-lymphocyte antibodies in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency."

We studied these factors and the evolution of HIV-1 resistance in response to LPV/r in a prospective study of patients receiving LPV/r under a temporary authorization in Bordeaux, France. HIV-1 PR and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined at baseline LPV/r for all the patients and at month 3 (M3) and M6 in the absence of response to treatment. pK measurements were determined at M1 and M3. Virological failure (VF) was defined as a plasma viral load >or=400 copies/ml at M3. A multivariate analysis of the predictors of VF, including clinical and biological characteristics and the treatment history of the patients, was performed. The PR gene sequence at M0, including individual mutations or a previously defined LPV mutation score (D. J. Kempf, J. D. Isaacson, M. S. King, S. C. Brun, Y. Xu, K. Real, B. M. Bernstein, A. J. Japour, E. Sun, and R. A. Rode, J. Virol. 75:7262-7269, 2001), and the individual exposure to LPV were also included covariates. Sixty-eight patients were enrolled. Thirty-four percent had a virological response at M3. An LPV mutation score of >5 mutations, the presence of the PR I54V mutation at baseline, a high number of previous PIs, prior therapy with ritonavir or indinavir, absence of coprescription of efavirenz, and a lower exposure to LPV or lower LPV trough concentrations were independently associated with VF on LPV/r. Additional PI resistance mutations, including primary mutation I50V, could be selected in patients failing on LPV/r. Genotypic and pK parameters should be used to optimize the virological response to LPV/r in PI-experienced patients and to avoid further viral evolution."

In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."

Blood culture, induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage, nasopharyngeal aspirate and gastric lavage were performed. Of the total, 151 children (60.4%) were HIV-infected. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), occurring in 19 (7.6%) children (15 HIV-positive), was the AIDS-defining infection in 20.3%. The incidence and type of bacteraemia (14.3%) were similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients; S. pneumoniae (5%) and S. aureus (2%) were the predominant isolates. Sputum or BAL cultures yielded bacteria in 145 of 243 (60%) specimens; viruses were cultured in 37 (15.2%). Bacterial prevalence (including M. tuberculosis in 8%) and anti-microbial resistance did not differ by HIV status except for S. aureus which was more common in HIV-infected children. Thirty-one (20%) HIV-positive and 8 (8%) HIV-negative children died [RR 1.16 (95% CI 1.05-1.28), p=0.008]; using multiple logistic regression, PCP was the only risk factor for mortality (p = 0.03)."
5999,0.001,1.0000,"A recent addition to the lymphokine network is human IL-10 (hIL-10). This novel lymphokine has striking homology to BCRF1 protein, the product of a previously uncharacterized open-reading frame in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome. To date, IL-10 expression has been described in several T clones induced with anti-CD3 and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), in monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and in murine B-cell lymphomas. We sought to determine whether human B cells express hIL-10 and, if so, its relationship to EBV and to other B-cell lymphokines. We studied 21 EBV-positive B-cell lines derived from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Burkitt's lymphoma (n = 6), American Burkitt's (n = 3), African Burkitt's (n = 5), and normal lymphoblastoid cell lines (n = 7), in comparison with seven EBV-negative cell lines. All cell lines were activated with the tumor promoters PMA and teleocidin and were studied by Northern blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). We demonstrated that EBV-positive cell lines derived from patients with American Burkitt's lymphoma, and especially those from patients with AIDS, constitutively express large quantities of hIL-10 by Northern blot analysis and ELISA (range, 3,101 to 25,915 pg/mL), and that both teleocidin and PMA induce hIL-10 in these cell lines. In contrast, six of seven EBV-negative cell lines did not express hIL-10 even by RT-PCR, and hIL-10 was not triggered by PMA or teleocidin. To assure that the 350 bp amplified by PCR was hIL-10 and not BCRF1, we used PCR primers, which do not amplify a fragment from plasmid templates containing BCRF1. Cloning and sequencing of the 350 bp product also demonstrated that B-cell IL-10 is identical to hIL-10 from the T-cell clone B21. Correlation of hIL-10 with other B-cell lymphokines secreted by these B-cell lines demonstrated that hIL-10 secretor cell lines also constitutively secrete or can be induced to secrete IL-6, although to a much lesser amount. Since both lymphokines influence B-cell growth and differentiation, we suggest that hIL-10 may contribute to the polyclonal B-cell activation and hyperglobulinemia seen in AIDS patients. Finally, several reports support the hypothesis that EBV is an important cofactor in the development of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-related B-cell lymphomas. Detection of large quantities of hIL-10 in B-cell lines derived from AIDS patients, the close association between EBV and hIL-10 shown in this report, and the ability of BCRF1 to capture hIL-10 activities, make hIL-10/BCRF1 an attractive candidate as a factor causing B-cell growth and immortalization in patients with AIDS and B-cell lymphomas."
7914,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver diseases. However, whether HBx has the ability to disturb the susceptibility of hepatocytes to common chemotherapeutic agents remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that HBx enhances cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity by a mechanism involving degradation of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Ectopic expression of HBx sensitized hepatocytes to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by a marked downregulation of Mcl-1 but not of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented HBx-induced proapoptotic and proinflammatory effects during cisplatin treatment both in vitro and in vivo. HBx-induced dysregulation of Mcl-1 resulted mainly from posttranslational degradation rather than transcription repression. Moreover, a caspase-3 inhibitor effectively abrogated HBx-enhanced Mcl-1 degradation and cell death. Importantly, antioxidants blocked activation of caspase-3 and acceleration of Mcl-1 loss, as well as cell death, in HBx-expressing hepatocytes upon cisplatin exposure in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data implicate oxidative stress-dependent caspase-3-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 as a mechanism contributing to HBx-mediated sensitization of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. A combination of cisplatin and antioxidants might provide more advantage than cisplatin alone in the treatment of cancer patients with chronic HBV infection."
2618,0.001,1.0000,"Retroviral integrase (IN) is expressed and incorporated into virions as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. IN catalyzes integration of the proviral DNA into host cell chromosomes during the early stages of the virus life cycle, and as a component of Gag-Pol, it is involved in virion morphogenesis during late stages. It is unknown whether the scheme, conserved among retroviruses, for expressing and incorporating IN as a component of the Gag-Pol precursor protein is necessary for its function in the infected cell after viral entry. We have developed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion-associated accessory proteins (Vpr and Vpx) as vehicles to deliver both foreign and viral proteins into the virus particle by their expression in trans as heterologous fusion proteins (X. Wu, et al., J. Virol. 69:3389-3398, 1995; X. Wu, et al., J. Virol. 70:3378-3384, 1996; X. Wu, et al., EMBO J. 16:5113-5122, 1977). To analyze IN function independent of its expression as a part of Gag-Pol, we expressed and incorporated IN into HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virions in trans as a fusion partner of Vpr (Vpr-IN). Our results demonstrate that the Vpr-IN fusion protein is efficiently incorporated into virions and then processed by the viral protease to liberate the IN protein. Virus derived from IN-minus provirus is noninfectious. However, this defect is overcome by trans complementation with the Vpr-IN fusion protein. Moreover, complemented virions are able to replicate through a complete cycle of infection, including formation of the provirus (integration). These results show, for the first time, that full IN function can be provided in trans, independent of its expression and incorporation into virions as a component of Gag-Pol. This finding also indicates that the IN domain of Gag-Pol is not required for the formation of infectious virions when IN is provided in trans. The ability to incorporate functional IN into retroviral particles in trans will provide unique opportunities to explore the function of this critical enzyme in a biologically relevant context, i.e., in infected cells as part of the nucleoprotein/preintegration complex."
4257,0.001,1.0000,"The programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway limits the function of virus-specific T cells during chronic infection. We previously showed that blockade of the PD-1 pathway increases HIV-1-associated T cell function in vitro. However, the effect of PD-1 blockade on HIV-1 disease progression in vivo has not been examined. As in humans, HIV-1-infected humanized BALB/c-Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) (Rag-hu) mice express elevated levels of PD-1 on T cells during chronic infection. To examine the effect of PD-1 blockade on disease progression, Rag-hu mice with chronic HIV-1 infection were treated with a blocking mAb directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand-1, the ligand for PD-1. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1-treated Rag-hu mice exhibited a progressive decrease in the HIV-1 plasma viral load, with a 7-fold decrease by day 7, a 20-fold decrease by day 14, a 178-fold decrease by day 21, and a 269-fold decrease by day 28 postinitiation of treatment. By day 7, the percentage of CD4(+) T cells was statistically higher in the treated compared with the untreated group, and this trend was sustained throughout the 28-d treatment period. Moreover, there was a strong inverse correlation between plasma viral load and the percentage of both CD4(+) (r = -0.66; p < 0.0001) and CD8(+) (r = -0.64; p < 0.0001) T cells in the treated mice but not the untreated mice. This study provides ""proof of concept"" that humanized mice can be used to examine the effects of immunotherapeutic interventions on HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, to our knowledge, these data demonstrate for the first time that blockade of the PD-1 pathway reduces HIV-1 viral loads."
2810,0.001,1.0000,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."

HCV RNA was detected by nested-PCR, using primers derived from the 5' non-coding region of HCV, and positive results were quantified using the b-DNA method. HCV RNA was detected in the saliva of 22/59 (37.3%) patients, with a mean level of 1.15 x 10(6) genome equivalents/ml; there was no correlation of salivary positivity with immune status (CD4 cell count), age or HIV risk group, but there was with gender (19/38 [50%] positive results in male, compared to 3/21 [14.3%] in female, P = 0.007). HCV RNA was detected in the serum of 45/59 (76.3%) patients at a higher level (mean of 2.52 x 10(7) genome equivalents/ml) compared to saliva. Positivity was not correlated with age, gender or CD4 + cell count. There was a correlation between qualitative saliva and serum results (P = 0.003), but not between quantifications (P = 0.57). This first study reporting significant amounts of HCV RNA in saliva could have important implications for HCV epidemiology."
6275,0.001,1.0000,"The fear of malevolent use of variola virus by terrorists has led to the implementation of a health care worker vaccination program and to the consideration of vaccination for the general public. However, due to concerns about side effects of the classical smallpox vaccine, especially for immunocompromised individuals, a safer vaccine is urgently needed. We characterized the immunogenicity of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), one of the more promising alternative smallpox vaccines, in a cohort of 10 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nine subjects received smallpox vaccination as children while one subject was never vaccinated against smallpox. All the subjects had CD4 counts >400 cells/mm(3) and 8 out of 10 had undetectable viral loads. MVA was able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses in the majority of individuals. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were mainly of the IgG class while T cells specific to vaccinia were predominantly CD8(+). The immune responses were maintained over 1 year. Similar vaccinia specific humoral immune responses were observed when our cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals was compared to smallpox-vaccinated healthy subjects. The observed immune responses suggest that the highly attenuated MVA could be used as a substitute vaccine against smallpox in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing HAART."

This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."

Fifty-one percent of the patients were hepatitis C antibody positive and 34% hepatitis B core antibody positive. None of the patients had antibodies against HIV or HTLV. Eighteen percent of the patients had an elevated alanine aminotransferase activity. Abnormal alanine aminotransferase was significantly associated with hepatitis C seropositivity. No new seroconversions were detected among the haemophiliacs or patients with type 3 von Willebrand disease when compared with the last two surveys in 1993 and 1996, and there was no seroconversion in sole users of solvent/detergent-treated factor products.

9007,0.001,1.0000,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."

We assessed the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control, as well as determinants of hypertension in HIV-infected adults in South Africa.A cross-sectional survey was conducted between March 2014 and February 2015 in a random sample of 827 adults (77.7% women), receiving care for HIV infection at 17 randomly selected public health facilities across the Western Cape Province, South Africa.Participants' mean age was 38.4 years overall, 41.1 years in men and 37.7 years in women (P < .001). The median diagnosed duration of HIV infection, similar in men and women, was 5 years, while the median CD4 count was 381 cell/mm. Age-standardized prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension was 38.6% (95% CI: 34.3-42.9), 46.3% (37.7-54.9), 76.4% (61.1-91.7), and 81.1% (62.9-99.3) in the overall sample; 40.0% (30.0-50.0), 36.3% (17.6-55.0), 84.8% (38.3-131.3), and 87.0% (38.2-135.8) in men; and 37.7% (32.9-42.5), 48.9% (38.9-58.9), 75.8% (59.1-92.5), and 81.3% (61.1-101.5) in women. Age and education were weakly associated with prevalent hypertension, while CD4 count and diagnosed duration of HIV infection were unrelated to prevalent hypertension.Similar to reports in the general population in this and other countries in the region, hypertension is frequent in young South Africans receiving care for HIV infection, with similar diagnostic and treatment gaps. Integrating HIV and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and care will, at least in part, reduce missed opportunities for implementing NCD prevention in HIV-infected people in care."
6602,0.001,1.0000,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."

HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively).

One of the recommended preventive modalities for these complications is participation in physical activity. The current study aims to determine the anthropometric profile and physical activity levels among people living with HIV and receiving HAART in Kigali, Rwanda. The study was a cross-sectional, descriptive quantitative survey. The participant's levels of physical activity participation and their association with anthropometric profiles were measured, using a structured self-administered questionnaire for 407 clients passing through the clinics. Of the participants, approximately 70% were inactive and in addition, 40% were obese and 43% overweight. Obesity was found to be strongly associated with inactivity. Lack of motivation, and time as well as fear of worsening the disease were found to be barriers to participation in physical activity."

There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."
8214,0.001,1.0000,"Elite controllers or suppressors (ES) are a group of HIV-1-infected individuals who maintain viral loads below the limit of detection of commercial assays for many years. The mechanisms responsible for this remarkable control are under intense study, with the hope of developing therapeutic vaccines effective against HIV-1. In this study, we addressed the question of the intrinsic susceptibility of ES CD4(+) T cells to infection. While we and others have previously shown that CD4(+) T cells from ES can be infected by HIV-1 isolates in vitro, these studies were confounded by exogenous activation and in vitro culture of CD4(+) T cells prior to infection. In order to avoid the changes in chemokine receptor expression that have been associated with such exogenous activation, we infected purified CD4(+) T cells directly after isolation from the peripheral blood of ES, viremic patients, and uninfected donors. We utilized a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing proviral construct pseudotyped with CCR5-tropic or CXCR4-tropic envelope to compare viral entry using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based, single-round virus-cell fusion assay. The frequency of productive infection was also compared by assessing GFP expression. CD4(+) T cells from ES were as susceptible as or more susceptible than cells from viremic patients and uninfected donors to HIV-1 entry and productive infection. The results of this physiological study strongly suggest that differences in HIV-1 entry and infection of CD4(+) T cells alone cannot explain the elite control of viral replication."
7847,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate whether hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDC) could mount a T cell response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients associated with chronic HBV infection, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 36 HBV-associated HCC patients were induced into MoDC and pulsed with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), alone and in combination. Co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and CD40, as well as human leucocyte antigens D-related (HLA-DR) were found to express at the highest level on MoDC pulsed with HBcAg or HBsAg + HBcAg, at a median level on MoDC pulsed with HBcAg or HBsAg alone, and at the lowest level on non-antigen-pulsed MoDC. Interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 cytokines were released by antigen-pulsed MoDC at increased levels in the order: no-antigen < HBsAg < HBcAg < HBcAg + HBsAg. MoDC pulsed with HBcAg or HBsAg + HBcAg also had the strongest ability to stimulate autologous T cell proliferation and intracellular interferon (IFN)-gamma production. HBcAg- or HBsAg + HBcAg-pulsed MoDC could also induce HBV core peptide-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation determined by tetramer staining. In addition, the antigen-pulsed MoDC were found to have a stronger capacity to produce IL-12 and induce T cell response in vitro for patients with higher alanine transaminase (ALT) levels than those with lower ALT levels, indicating that antigen pulse could substantially reverse the impaired function of MoDC in primary HCC patients with active chronic hepatitis B. In conclusion, HBV antigen-pulsed MoDC from HCC patients with chronic hepatitis B could induce HBV-specific T cell response in vitro."
145,0.001,1.0000,"As human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are acquired through the same routes of contamination, the prevalence of HBV serological markers found in the HIV-infected population is approximately 7%. Liver-related mortality and morbidity is higher in HIV/HBV co-infected patients than in HBV mono-infected patients. Both viruses must be considered before a treatment decision is made. According to the European consensus conference on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C in HIV coinfected patients, treatment is based on whether there is an existing indication of anti- HIV therapy or not. In patients with no indication of anti-HIV therapy, drugs with dual anti-viral activity (lamivudine, entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) should not be used due to the risk of developing HIV-resistance. Interferon or adefovir in combination with telbivudine are recommended. In patients with an indication of anti-HIV therapy, a backbone of highly active anti-retroviral therapy should include tenofovir in combination with lamivudine or emtricitabine. The same regimen is recommended in patients who develop lamivudine resistance."
3192,0.001,1.0000,"Previously we found that corticosteroid treatment in the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated membranous nephropathy (HBVMN) was not associated with a favorable outcome. To distinguish the differences of the HBV DNA in macrophage, T and B cells among HBVMN patients with or without corticosteroid treatment, serial studies at different time points were investigated. HBV DNA appeared as an ""episomal"" molecule as with 3.2 kb in macrophage, T and B cells. This molecule disappeared after 12 months among HBVMN patients without corticosteroid treatment. HBV DNA, by contrast, appeared as episomal form even three years later in T cells, with frequent proteinuria among HBVMN patients with corticosteroid treatment. This finding indicates that the use of corticosteroids leads to a potential risk of enhancing HBV viral replication in T cells. We studied 24 HBVMN patients who had previously received corticosteroid treatment and had persistent proteinuria, who were administered combination therapy with adenine arabinoside for two weeks and thymic extract (Thymostimulin) for six months to decrease urine protein loss and obtain seroconversion. These 24 patients had heavy (22 of 24, 91.6%) or mild (2 of 24, 8.4%) proteinuria prior to adenine arabinoside and thymostimulin treatment. All 24 patients demonstrated HBV DNA in mononuclear cells and simultaneously exhibited sera positive with HBsAg and HBeAg. In contrast, after treatment only one case (4.2%) had heavy and two cases (8.4%) mild proteinuria; HBV DNA was demonstrated in macrophage (4 of 24, 16.7%), T cells (9 of 24, 37.5%), and B cells (6 of 24, 25%) as well as serum (24 of 24, 100%) prior to treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
98,0.001,1.0000,"A large number of nef alleles were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of four long-term nonprogressing survivors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and from five individuals with progressive HIV-1 infection. These primary nef alleles were characterized by DNA sequence analysis and for their ability to downregulate CD4 surface expression. Intact nef open reading frames that directed the expression of Nef protein were recovered from all of the individuals. Most of the Nef proteins derived from three of four individuals with nonprogressive infection and from all five individuals with progressive infection were functional as judged by their ability to induce a decrease in surface CD4 expression. In contrast, one individual with nonprogressive HIV-1 infection yielded an unusually high frequency of disrupted nef open reading frames and Nef proteins defective for CD4 downregulation. Approximately 70% of the nef clones obtained from the PBMC of this individual at eight time points over a 12-year period were disrupted or defective for CD4 downregulation. While functional Nef proteins were demonstrated early in the course of infection (1983), functional nef alleles have surprisingly not come to predominate over time in PBMC DNA in this individual."
2054,0.001,1.0000,"Human DNA flanking sites of eight human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral integrations have been analyzed in isolates derived both from integrations in an infected individual and from tissue culture. Sequence analysis encompassing 80-3000 bp of human DNA on one or both sides of the site of integration revealed that seven of the eight HIV-1 proviruses had integrated directly into or within one nucleosome's distance from an L1Hs or Alu repetitive element. To compare this with the frequency at which human L1 or Alu elements sharing > or = 70% identity with L1Hs and Alu consensus sequences would be encountered at random, > 200 bp from each of 82 individual anonymously cloned segments of human DNA were sequenced: L1Hs elements were encountered in 8.5% of the 82 clones and Alu elements were encountered in 13.4+ by using these homology windows. From these data it appears that HIV-1 integrates into or near L1Hs elements with an approximately 6-fold higher frequency than would be expected if HIV-1 integration events were distributed uniformly throughout the genome. A cumulative binomial probability test shows that there is a 0.26% chance that one would arrive at these figures by chance and puts the data well within a 99% confidence interval. We propose that sites of L1Hs and Alu insertions originally occurred in regions of chromatin that were more easily accessible to the retroposon machinery and that these regions are now acting as preferred integration sites for HIV-1."
4102,0.001,1.0000,"Viral mutations have been implicated in alteration of the biological phenotype of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."
1452,0.001,1.0000,"In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual, immune-pressure-mediated positive selection operates to maintain the antigenic polymorphism on the gp120 third variable (V3) loop. Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants."
1685,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be subtyped on the basis of nucleotide sequence variability. Knowledge of circulating HIV-1 genotypes or subtypes allows understanding of the origin and spread of HIV-1 in different geographical regions, and is required for rational vaccine development. A study was undertaken to determine the predominant HIV-1 subtype in Australia. Part of the HIV-1 envelope gene (including the variable domain, V3) was sequenced directly from DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 HIV-1 seropositive people in Sydney, Australia. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence suggested that all patients (including individual cases acquired in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Thailand) were infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Octapeptides from the HIV-1 envelope V3 loop tip indicated variation but included a predominance of the most common subtype B octapeptides HIGPGRAF (4 cases), NIGPGRAF (3 cases) and PIGPGRAF (1 case). These data suggest that subtype B is the major HIV-1 strain in Australia (and probably in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea), although the importation of HIV-1 acquired overseas is likely to lead to the detection and dissemination of other subtypes in Australia."
5606,0.001,1.0000,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."
6991,0.001,1.0000,"The spectrum of complications emerging in successfully treated HIV-infected patients has dramatically changed since the advent of HAART. Typical AIDS-defining illnesses have been substituted by new comorbid conditions that threaten even those patients who maintain virologic suppression. Proper management of cardiovascular risk, and early diagnosis of AIDS-related and, particularly, non-AIDS-related malignancies (including papilomavirus-related neoplasms) must be introduced into the routine of care. Hot areas of investigation include HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, hepatitis B and C coinfection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and tuberculosis. Bone and kidney long-term toxicities and lipoatrophy remain as issues of paramount importance. The identification and early treatment of immune reconstitution disease is also of major interest, specially in those patients starting their antiretroviral treatment with severe CD4 cell depletion. The present review focuses on these twelve areas of increasing interest for physicians currently facing successfully treated HIV+ patients."
2546,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide public health concern. The circulation of strains carrying mutations in the viral proteins implies both clinical and therapeutics challenges. HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."

In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."

No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate.

The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B.

Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
3642,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."

Housing as a structural intervention for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS has been shown both to be feasible and to improve access to care. However, few studies report the impact of accessing stable housing on residents' viral load counts, even though viral load has been accepted as the best predictor of clinical prognosis for over a decade. The Open Door is a nonprofit agency that utilizes a harm reduction, housing first model of care to improve clinical outcomes for homeless people living with HIV. This article describes the first study that utilizes viral load to assess the effectiveness of a housing first approach. During the study period, we found that 69% of residents of The Open Door achieved undetectable viral loads, which far exceeds adherence rates ranging from 13 to 32% that were found in other studies of similar vulnerable populations. This finding supports the feasibility of this approach and its potential impact on reducing HIV morbidity, mortality, and secondary transmission. Given that the majority of the residents were active substance users during the study period and achieved undetectable viral loads, our findings also substantiate other studies demonstrating that substance users are able to maintain clinical adherence."
427,0.001,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the first approved HIV-1 entry into cells' inhibitor. It is a peptide with an amino acid sequence analogue to HR2 region of the viral surface glycoprotein gp41. Its mechanism of action is the competitive binding to HR1 region of the gp41, preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2 and impeding the conformational changes in gp41 necessary for fusion of the virus with the cell. Its application is by subcutaneous injection. The main clinical trials of enfuvirtide (TORO 1 and 2) were performed in HIV-infected patients with virological failure, high antiretroviral experience and highly resistant viral isolates. Those trials showed that the addition of enfuvirtide to an optimized HAART (chosen with a resistance test) provided better results than HAART alone, measured by drop in viral load and immunologic benefit. The best results were observed in the subgroup of patients with more useful drugs in HAART (according to the information of the resistance test), a lower viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count at baseline. The most important adverse event is the production of injection drug hypersensitivity reaction in 98% of patients. The high cost is compensated by a reduction in costs derived from admissions."
6413,0.001,1.0000,"A methodology based on micellar liquid chromatography to monitor five antiretroviral drugs (lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and efavirenz) was proposed. Antiretrovirals were studied in sets of three, corresponding to each highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regime, prescribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-infected patients. Four aqueous micellar mobile phases buffered at pH 7 were optimized to separate these compounds, using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the tensioactive, and 1-propanol or 1-pentanol as the organic modifier. The composition of each mobile phase was optimized for each antiretroviral. The common separation conditions were: C18 apolar column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size), UV detection set at 214 nm, and mobile phase running at 1 mL min(-1) without controlling the temperature. The finally suggested method was validated for five analysed antiretroviral drugs following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of: linearity between 0.5 and 50 ppm (r(2) > 0.9995), sensitivity (LOD lower than 0.25 ppm), intra- and inter-day precision (<7.1 and <5.2%, respectively) and accuracy (recovery 88.5-105.3% and 93.5-101.3%, respectively), as well as robustness (<6.5%).

Of the males, 1 was bisexual, 2 were promiscuous, and the female was the sexual partner of a non symptomatic HIV-infected man. No immunological disturbances or other AIDS related alterations were observed. There was one case of miliary TB, but neither atypical X-ray abnormalities nor extrapulmonary involvement were found. Tuberculin reaction was positive in three of the four HIV infected patients. Clinical, radiological and bacteriological evolution were favorable. Adverse drug reaction occurred in two cases, one of them presenting serious toxidermia caused by isoniazid.

The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4372,0.001,1.0000,"The routes of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus transmission are quite similar and coexistence of both viruses in one patient is not a rare phenomenon. Until now, the natural course of liver diseases induced by coinfections has not been well documented and the mechanisms of interaction between the two viruses and the human host have not been fully clarified. We report the case of a patient suffering from chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis C virus who developed an acute hepatitis B virus superinfection. Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid became undetectable by reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis of acute hepatitis B virus infection. At the same time, there was a striking increase in the serum concentrations of the antibodies against C22 and C33c hepatitis C virus antigens. Four months after clinical resolution of the acute hepatitis, hepatitis B surface antigen was undetectable in serum and three months later antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen appeared. Two years after acute hepatitis B virus infection, the patient has had no relapse of markers for viral replication of hepatitis B virus. Transaminases are within the reference range and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid is undetectable in both serum and liver tissue. We hypothesize that acute hepatitis B virus infection stimulated a specific humoral response against hepatitis C virus as well as triggering non-specific defense mechanisms which finally eliminated both viruses."
1891,0.001,1.0000,"The human placenta is relatively resistant to Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), but obstetric complications associated with inflammatory processes, including chorioamnionitis and spontaneous preterm delivery, are associated with increased rates of vertical transmission. It was hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which promotes HIV-1 transmission across endothelial membranes, increases HIV-1 transmission across the placenta. Flow cytometry and immunostaining studies were performed, which demonstrated that the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 were not expressed by villous trophoblast cells. Consequently, primary villous trophoblast cells were not infected with cell-free HIV-1 isolates, as measured by in situ PCR and quantitative PCR, but villous trophoblast cells were infected by HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). HIV-1 from infected PBMC was rapidly transported across confluent transformed trophoblast cell monolayers by transcytosis, and TNF-alpha significantly upregulated transcytosis of HIV-1 across the trophoblast layer without disrupting cell viability or confluency. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha (antibodies against TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptors) and an anti-inflammatory drug (tenidap) significantly reduced transcytosis rates. It was concluded that the villous trophoblast is resistant to infection by cell-free HIV-1 but susceptible to transcytosis of HIV-1 from infected PBMC, and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha may play a critical role in promoting maternal-fetal transmission of HIV-1."

Proviral DNA of X4 (LAI and NL4-3) and R5 (Ba-L) HIV-1 strains were detected in LCs integrated in the reconstituted mucosa. Infection of LCs could be specifically inhibited by the chemokines stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and -secreted), confirming the presence of functional coreceptors on LCs generated in vitro. A complete inhibition of LCs, by use of azidothymidine, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, was also observed. Moreover, HIV-1-infected LCs of the reconstructed mucosa were able to transmit R5 or X4 HIV-1 strains to activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such a model could be a useful tool to study the mechanisms involved in transmission of HIV in the female genital tract."

Three patients (3.3%) had an M46I amino acid substitution in the protease (PR) gene that decreased susceptibility to IDV, RTV, and NFV and one patient (1.1%) had an M184I amino acid substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC. Minor mutations were detected in high frequency in the PR gene. The frequencies of minor mutations to protease inhibitors (PI) were I93L (71.4%), L63P (62.6%), V77I (62.6%), M36I/V (33.0%), A71T/V (22.0%), K20R (6.6%), G16E (6.6%), and L10I (5.5%). The relatedness between subtypes and the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in PR were observed; 63P, 77I, and 71V/T were found in HIV-1 subtype B'/B, 16E, 36I, 20R/I, and 82I in non-B, except for CRF07_BC, 10I in subtype A, and 93L in non-A. Although the primary resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is low among the treatment-naive HIV-1 patients living in Liaoning province, the surveillance and monitoring of drug-resistant HIV-1 should be implemented regularly because of the increased access to antiretroviral therapy in China."

In a large, randomized, double-blind, multinational, ongoing trial in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection, raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was noninferior to efavirenz 600 mg once daily in achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA viral levels of <50 copies/mL after 48 weeks' treatment (primary endpoint), when used as part of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) combination regimen. The time to achieve a virological response was significantly shorter in the raltegravir group than in the efavirenz group. Furthermore, significantly more raltegravir than efavirenz recipients achieved HIV-1 RNA viral levels of <50 copies/mL at weeks 2-16. The efficacy of raltegravir in achieving HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 copies/mL was also demonstrated in subgroups of patients separated according to baseline viral levels, CD4+ cell counts and viral subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests that both virological and CD4+ cell count improvements were maintained at 96 weeks for treatment-naive recipients of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. As part of an ART combination regimen, raltegravir treatment was generally well tolerated and was associated with significantly fewer drug-related adverse events than efavirenz treatment. Moreover, after 96 weeks, raltegravir treatment was associated with a significantly lower impact on serum lipid levels than efavirenz treatment."

The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS in the United States continues to increase, estimated at more than 370,000 in 1998, and there is good reason for optimism that HIV infection may be a controllable disease in many people. Nevertheless, an estimated 27,000 persons still died of AIDS in the United States in 1997, and AIDS is still a leading cause of death in the age group 25 to 44 years. Despite the dramatic treatment advances for HIV infection and improving survival following an AIDS diagnosis, many patients still present with life-threatening complications of HIV infection for three major reasons. Highly active antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and other infections are not effective in all patients, despite rigorous adherence to treatment. Others adhere to these therapies poorly. Finally, many patients present with advanced disease, unaware that they have HIV infection until they develop a serious opportunistic infection. Therefore, the AIDS epidemic and its burden of illness will continue, and decisions regarding the appropriateness of intensive care for individual patients will be inevitable. The impact of AIDS in Africa and Asia is far more devastating than in the United States and Europe, and most HIV-infected persons in the world live in the underdeveloped nations where intensive care is often unavailable.

However, it is technically difficult to demonstrate CTL responses consistently in nonhuman primate and human subjects using traditional cytotoxicity assay methods. In this study, we systematically evaluated culture conditions that may affect the proliferation and expansion of CTL effector cells and presented a sensitive method for detection of cytotoxicity responses with bulk CTL cultures. We confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of this method by demonstration of vigorous CTL responses in a simian-HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaque. The expansion of epitope-specific CTL effector cells was also measured quantitatively by CTL epitope-major histocompatibility complex tetramer complex staining. In addition, two new T-cell determinants in the SIV gag region are identified. Last, we showed the utility of this method for studying CTL responses in chimpanzee and human subjects."

The detailed kinetic of HLA-B51-restricted CTL responses was described through blood sampling time points including seroconversion, 3 and 6 months after HIV-1 infection in the 7 HLA-B51+ individuals, by using 16 known HLA-B51 restricted epitopes. Pol743-751 (LPPVVAKEI, LI9), Pol283-289 (TAFTIPSI, TI8), and Gag327-3459 (NANPDCKTI, NI9) were identified as 3 dominant epitopes, and ranked as starting with LI9, followed by TI8 and NI9 in the ability to induce T-cell responses. The dynamics of escape mutations in the 3 epitopes were also found with the same order as T-cell response, by using sequencing for viral clones on blood sampling at seroconversion, 3 and 6 months after HIV-1 infection.We use solid evidence to demonstrate the correlation between T-cell response and HIV-1 mutation, and postulate that multiple T-cell responses might benefit the control of HIV-1 infection, especially in acute infection phase.

The engineered ribozymes, as well as antisense sequence complementary to the Mo-MLV psi packaging region, were cloned into the 3' untranslated region of the neomycin-resistance gene (neo). This was coupled to the simian virus 40 early promoter within the pSV2neo vector. For the ribozymes against the Mo-MLV psi site, the constructs were transfected into Mo-MLV-infected and virus-producing mouse NIH 3T3 cells. With the exception of one of the single ribozymes (the one least effective in cutting target RNA in vitro), all of the constructs effectively (70-80%) suppressed retrovirus production. These results demonstrate a direct correlation between in vitro cleavage and in vivo ribozyme-mediated virus suppression. In addition, a ribozyme targeted to the HIV-1 psi packaging site was engineered into the same vector and transfected into the human T-cell line SupT1. The transfectants were cloned and then challenged with HIV-1. When compared to vector-transfected control cells, a significant reduction in HIV-1 production was observed as measured by p24 and syncytia formation assays. This study demonstrates a feasible approach to the suppression of retrovirus replication by targeting the psi packaging site with hammerhead ribozymes."

4236,0.001,1.0000,"Although hepatitis B infection is endemic in southern Africa, a changing epidemiology of the disease has recently been documented in the region. The authors surveyed migrant southern African male mineworkers during 1986 to establish the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and D (delta) infection in their areas of origin. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was tested in 29,312 adult male mineworkers from 18 geographic regions, encompassing the diverse tribal and linguistic groups in the region, as well as in expatriate mineworkers from neighboring southern African countries. The same cohort was also tested for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Selected hepatitis B carriers were also tested for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), antibody to hepatitis D (anti-HD), and alpha-fetoprotein. The overall prevalence of HBsAg in this survey was 9.9%. However, the prevalence varied from 5.5% to 14% in different ethnic groups. A minority of carriers (4.9%) had replicative hepatitis B infection and were hepatitis B virus DNA-positive. Only 0.6% of tested carriers were anti-HD-positive. Alpha-fetoprotein determinations were abnormal in 1.2% of hepatitis B-positive men. These data show that although chronic hepatitis B infection remains widespread in southern Africa, carrier rates vary significantly from region to region. In contrast, hepatitis D co-infection remains extremely uncommon. These baseline seroprevalence data also establish that HIV infection was, in 1986, a rare infection in the indigenous population of South Africa."

This protective role is linked to single immunodominant HLA-B27-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes in both infections. In order to define the relative contribution of a specific HLA-B27-restricted epitope to the natural course of HCV infection, we compared the biological impact of the highly conserved HCV genotype 1 epitope, for which the protective role has been described, with the corresponding region in genotype 3 that differs in its sequence by three amino acid residues. The genotype 3a peptide was not recognized by CD8+ T cells specific for the genotype 1 peptide. Furthermore, patients with acute or chronic infection with HCV genotype 3a did not mount T-cell responses to this epitope region, and their autologous viral sequences showed no evidence of T-cell pressure. Finally, we found a significantly higher frequency of HLA-B27 positivity in patients with chronic HCV genotype 3a infection compared to genotype 1 infection, indicating that there is no protection by HLA-B27 in HCV genotype 3 infection."

In this study, we investigated the HGV RNA changes and responses to IFN therapy of HGV RNA-positive hepatitis C patients. The presence of HGV RNA in 264 patients who received IFN therapy at our institute was examined using the nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers deduced from the 5' non-coding region (5'-NCR) of the HGV. We also analysed the nucleotide sequences of the 5'-NCR and HGV before and after IFN therapy. Twelve (4.5%) of the 264 patients with chronic hepatitis C were HGV RNA positive. Of these 12 patients, full information was available in nine. Of those nine, seven became HGV RNA negative during IFN therapy but in six of the seven a relapse occurred. HCV RNA was not detected 1 year after IFN therapy in six patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of all the HCV RNA-negative patients post-treatment was within the normal range, irrespective of their HGV RNA status. Nucleotide sequences did not change after IFN therapy in any patient. Hence, we confirm that HGV is sensitive to IFN therapy but the liver damage caused by HGV infection is very mild or does not modify the liver function tests."

Although the chimpanzee showed no signs of disease, it lost both CD4+ (as low as 134 cells/microliter) and CD8+ lymphocytes approximately 30 months after initial infection, followed by thrombocytopenia that has persisted for greater than 2 years. Lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia were preceded by or coincided with the appearance of antibodies cross-reactive with histone H2B and decreased levels of complement component C4; an eightfold decrease in HIV-specific antibody titers; the inability of CD8+ lymphocytes to suppress virus replication; impaired proliferative responses to T cell mitogens; and the isolation of cell-free HIV from plasma.

Relatively stable levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptor (R)II, soluble interleukin-2R, neopterin, and beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) were documented over 5-8 weeks in patients with AIDS and for 1-4 years in the other groups. beta2M was generally the most stable marker. Interferon-gamma levels, however, fluctuated substantially. Individuals, whether normal or HIV-positive, maintain characteristic plasma levels of cytokines and immune activation markers. Thus, documented changes, in excess of the variability observed in this study, are likely to be significant indicators of change in disease status or effects of therapy."

We confirm that deletions or gross abnormalities in nef are rarely present. However, a comparison of Nef consensus sequences derived from 41 long-term nonprogressors and from 50 individuals with progressive HIV-1 infection revealed that specific variations are associated with different stages of infection. Five amino acid variations in Nef (T15, N51, H102, L170, and E182) were more frequently observed among nonprogressors, while nine features (an additional N-terminal PxxP motif, A15, R39, T51, T157, C163, N169, Q170, and M182) were more frequently found in progressors. Strong correlations between the frequency of these variations in Nef and both the CD4(+)-cell count and the viral load were observed. Moreover, analysis of sequential samples obtained from two progressors revealed that several variations in Nef, which were more commonly observed in patients with low CD4(+)-T-cell counts, were detected only during or after progression to immunodeficiency. Our results indicate that sequence variations in Nef are associated with different stages of HIV-1 infection and suggest a link between nef gene function and the immune status of the infected individual."
2378,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the change in sexual behavior among homosexual men observed after the start of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic resulted in a change in herpes simplex virus (HSV) seroprevalence in this group over time. In a cross-sectional study, the prevalence of herpesvirus types 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2) was determined at study entry in 1984-1985 and 1995-1997 among 532 young (aged < or = 30 years) homosexual men participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS. Risk factors for the presence of HSV antibodies, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, were evaluated, and their influence on HSV prevalence over time was assessed. A strong decrease in HSV1 and HSV2 seroprevalence, from 80.6% to 59.0% and from 51.3% to 19.0%, respectively, was observed between the two time periods. This decrease was not markedly influenced by various demographic and socioeconomic factors. After data were controlled for several markers of sexual activity (such as number of sex partners, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and past episode(s) of gonorrhea), it appeared that the decline in HSV seroprevalence was explained by a concurrent decrease in the presence of these markers. The authors conclude that among young homosexual men in this study, the strong decrease in HSV seroprevalence was associated with a concurrent shift in sexual behavior. Furthermore, these data suggest an increasing sexual component in HSV1 transmission over time."
2789,0.001,1.0000,"Nucleot(s)ide analogues and peginterferon (PEG-IFN) treatment are the only approved therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, complete eradication of the virus, as indicated by persistent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), is rare among treated patients. This is due to long-term persistence of the HBV genome in infected hepatocytes in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In this study, we investigated whether administration of a large dose of a nucleoside analogue in combination with PEG-IFN can achieve long-term loss of HBsAg in human hepatocyte chimeric mice. Mice were treated with a high dose of entecavir and/or PEG-IFN for 6 weeks. High-dose combination therapy with both drugs resulted in persistently negative HBV DNA in serum. Although small amounts of HBV DNA and cccDNA (0.1 and 0.01 copy/cell, respectively) remained in the mouse livers, some of the mice remained persistently negative for serum HBV DNA at 13 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Serum HBsAg and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) continued to decrease and eventually became negative at 12 weeks after cessation of the therapy. Analysis of the HBV genome in treated mice showed accumulation of G-to-A hypermutation and CpG III island methylation. Persistent loss of serum HBV DNA and loss of HBV markers by high-dose entecavir and PEG-IFN combination treatment in chimeric mice suggests that control of HBV can be achieved even in the absence of a cellular immune response."

The aim of our study was to determine whether changes in α-mannosidase I expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) occur in patients with HBV infection. Peripheral blood was collected from 90 HBV-infected patients (grouped into immune tolerance, chronic hepatitis B, or inactive carrier group based on their clinical states) and 30 healthy donors. Expression of the three α-mannosidase I subtypes, MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1, was measured using western blot analyses. Compared with the healthy controls, significant increases in the MAN1A1, MAN1A2, and MAN1C1 expression levels were observed in the three HBV-infected groups, among whom the immune tolerance group showed the largest increase. For the patients in the immune tolerance phase, the expression levels of both MAN1A1 and MAN1A2 were linearly and positively correlated with the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) titer and HBV DNA level, although a positive correlation was only found between MAN1C1 expression and the HBeAg titer. These results indicate that increased α-mannosidase I expression in PBMCs may play an important role in HBV immune escape and that its expression level is closely related to viral replication activity.

Moreover, the clinical significance of these parameters in relation to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion (SC) is largely unknown. In this study, the circulation of Tregs in HBeAg-positive CHB patients was determined by flow cytometry, and the molecular profiles of frequent TCRBV patterns of Tregs were analyzed using a gene melting spectral pattern. The parameters, such as Treg frequency, the number of skewed TCRBV patterns, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, were analyzed by comparing their associations in seroconverting and non-seroconverting patients following TDF treatment. The Treg frequency was significantly correlated with the ALT level in seroconverting but not in non-seroconverting patients. Similarly, skewed TCRBV patterns were remarkably associated with HBV DNA levels in the SC group. Six TCRBV families (BV3, BV11, BV12, BV14, BV20, and BV24) were more prevalent than other TCRBV members in seroconverting patients pretreated with TDF, while BV12, BV15, and BV22 were predominant in non-seroconverting patients during TDF treatment. Taken together, the preferential TCRBV patterns may be associated with immune responses related to SC. The dynamic frequency and skewed TCRBV patterns of peripheral Tregs could contribute to predicting SC in CHB patients. Moreover, the conserved TCRBV complementarity-determining region (CDR3) motif may be targeted to develop personalized immunotherapy for CHB patients."

The patient was known to be coinfected with HIV and HBV for years and the HBV DNA was measured repeatedly at low levels. A significant increase of HBV DNA up to 1.7 x 10⁷ IU/ml was found accompanied with clinical symptoms of hepatitis. Multiple mutations occurred in the S gene during the flare-up of HBV as shown by sequencing, including I103T, K122R, M133I, F134V, D144E, V164E and L175S.

The present study was designed to investigate the differential expression patterns of ISG20 in liver biopsy samples from treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B and non-HBV infected controls and to determine the relation between the differential expression and IFN-α treatment outcome (responders vs. non-responders). HBV infection status was determined by measuring levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by chemoluminescence immunoassay and of HBV DNA by real-time quantitative (q)PCR. ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR, respectively. Chronic hepatitis B responders showed significantly higher levels of ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions than either the chronic hepatitis B non-responders or the controls. Moreover, increased expression of ISG20 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm was correlated with positive response to IFN-α treatment. Thus, active transcription and translation of ISG20 may represent a marker to identify chronic hepatitis B patients likely to respond to IFN-α therapy. Prognostic clinical strategies based upon this marker may include genomic screening methods and immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies."

In order to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates, we designed eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HBV-specific gRNA/Cas9 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cas9 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cas9 systems.

Using nested amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we detected low concentrations of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum of 6 of 23 (26%) healthy black African adults with normal liver function and with hepatitis B virus surface antibody as the only serological marker of the virus. This finding offers one explanation for the earlier observation of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatocellular carcinomas in black Africans whose serum was positive for surface antibody alone. A number of genetic changes were found in the six isolates that might be responsible for evasion of the immune response and persistence of the virus. Isolated mutations were detected in the ""a"" determinant of the surface gene and in the encapsidation signal. In all five isolates sequenced in the core promoter, mutations were present in the upstream regulatory region. Recombination between genotypes A and D was present in three of the isolates, including both of those in which the entire genome was sequenced. This change in genotype also overlapped the amino end of the polymerase domain and may result in sufficiently low levels of replication to allow viral persistence.

Guidelines made by international experts need however to be adapted to local health care systems. Here, we summarise the EASL guidelines with some minor modifications in order to be compatible with the particular Swiss situation, while discussing in more detail some aspects. Chronic hepatitis B is a complex disease with several phases where host and viral factors interact: the features of this continuous interplay need to be evaluated when choosing the most appropriate treatment. The EASL guidelines recommend, as first-line agents, using the most potent antivirals available with the optimal resistance profile, in order to abate HBV DNA as rapidly and as sustainably as possible. Once therapy has been started, the infection evolves and resistant viral strains may emerge. Rescue therapy needs to be started early with more potent agents lacking cross-resistance."

4988,0.001,1.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient."
8288,0.001,1.0000,"Effective CD8(+) T cell responses have been induced using totally synthetic self-adjuvanting lipopeptides containing the dipalmitoyl-S-glyceryl cysteine lipid moiety, which is a ligand for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on dendritic cells (DC). In this study, we evaluated the use of lipopeptide vaccine candidates containing HLA-A2-restricted epitopes for DC-based immunotherapy of HCV infection. Lipopeptides were able to induce specific CD8(+) T cell responses in HLA-A2 transgenic mice and consistently activated human monocyte-derived DC from both healthy individuals and HCV infected patients. Lipopeptide-pulsed human DC were also found to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12p70 and were able to activate antigen-specific IFN-gamma production by autologous CD8(+) T cells obtained from a hepatitis C patient. These results show that DC from HCV patients can be matured and antigen loaded with TLR2-targeting lipopeptides for effective presentation of CD8(+) T cell epitopes; the use of autologous lipopeptide-pulsed DC or direct lipopeptide vaccination may be successful approaches for the priming or boosting of anti-HCV CD8(+) T cell responses to aid in the clearance of the virus in chronically infected individuals."
9376,0.001,1.0000,"The increasing prevalence of HIV-1 subtype B' in China and Southeast Asia calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model to study viral transmission and pathogenesis. Because there are significant differences between subtype B' HIV-1 and other chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency viru (SHIVs) in the env gene, a novel SHIV, designated SHIV(B'WHU), was generated by replacing counterparts of SHIV(SF33) with tat/rev/vpu/env genes derived from a primary, CCR5-tropic, subtype B' HIV-1 strain of a Chinese patient. SHIV(B'WHU) was able to replicate in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used CCR5 as its major coreceptor. Moreover, after serial passages in Chinese macaques, the in vivo infectivity of SHIV(B'WHU) was enhanced, yet no significant sequence changes were found in viral envelopes, and the virus did not change its CCR5-tropism. CD4(+) T-cell loss, however, was found in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of small intestines of infected macaques. Our findings have implications in understanding the early pathogenesis of SHIV(B'WHU) in Chinese macaques."
5582,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can manipulate the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks in infected cells to create a permissive environment for viral replication, cellular injury, disease onset, and its progression. The aim of the present study was to understand the miRNA networks and their target genes in the liver of hepatitis B patients involved in HBV replication, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. We investigated differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray in liver biopsy samples from different stages of HBV infection and liver disease (immune-tolerant [n = 8], acute viral hepatitis [n = 8], no fibrosis [n = 16], early [F1+F2, n = 19] or late [F3+F4, n = 14] fibrosis, and healthy controls [n = 7]). miRNA expression levels were analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks identified 17 miRNAs and 18 target gene interactions with four distinct nodes, each representing a stage-specific gene regulation during disease progression. The immune-tolerant group showed elevated miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and Let-7a-3p levels, which could target genes involved in innate immune response and viral replication. In the acute viral hepatitis group, miR-125b-5p and miR-3613-3p were up, whereas miR-940 was down, which might affect cell proliferation through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In early fibrosis, miR-34b-3p, miR-1224-3p, and miR-1227-3p were up, while miR-499a-5p was down, which together possibly mediate chronic inflammation. In advanced fibrosis, miR-1, miR-10b-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-133b, and miR-671-5p were up, while miR-20b-5p and miR-455-3p were down, possibly allowing chronic disease progression. Interestingly, only 8 of 17 liver-specific miRNAs exhibited a similar expression pattern in patient sera."
5239,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may develop severe chronic liver disease. Carriers of HBV have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide an estimated 350 million people are infected with HBV, and 15-40% will develop serious sequelae in their lifetime. In our study we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first exon and promoter region of the mannose-binding lectin gene 2 (MBL2) situated on chromosome 10, with susceptibility to HBV infection. One-hundred and two patients infected with HBV were included in this study, and 232 uninfected individuals were used as healthy controls. Genotyping of the first exon (alleles A/O) was performed using a melting temperature assay. Genotyping of the promoter region (-550 H/L; -221 Y/X) was performed using the Taqman PCR technique. In the HBV-infected group we found a significantly increased frequency of haplotypes associated with low serum MBL. Our findings may indicate that MBL has a protective role against HBV infection in the studied population."
8089,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the impact of chronic viral hepatitis on host immune response, we analyzed the incidence of acute rejection and the frequency of infections in 86 patients infected with hepatitis B and C viruses and had developed clinical evidence of chronic liver disease and 1283 control patients who were transplanted at our center during the same period, but had no evidence of chronic viral hepatitis. To compare the mean number of rejections and the mean number of infections between the two groups, we used multivariate linear regression analysis, which allowed us to adjust simultaneously for the effects of 10 other risk variables with potential impact on graft rejection and posttransplant infection. During a mean follow up of 5.3+/-5.2 years, 62% of hepatitis patients and 54% of control patients had experienced an acute rejection (P=NS). The mean rejections/patient in the hepatitis group was 1.3+/-0.14 versus 1.03+/-0.03 in control (P=NS). In the linear regression analysis, the number of acute rejections in the hepatitis group was 0.16 higher than in control (P=NS). With reference to infection, 84% of hepatitis patients experienced an infectious complication in the posttransplant period, compared with 75% in the control (P=0.05). The mean number of infections/patient was 5.7+/-0.73 in the hepatitis group compared with 3.9+/-0.14 in the control group (P=0.002). The linear regression model had shown that the hepatitis group had a relative increase of 1.18 infections/pt, compared with control. Of the different sites of infection, the hepatitis group had a significant increase in bloodstream (0.48+/-0.08 vs. 0.25+/-0.02) P=0.003; pulmonary (0.60+/-0.09 vs. 0.38+/-0.03) P=0.03; and CNS infections (0.08+/-0.03 vs. 0.02+/-0.004) P=0.05 compared with control. Among the different microorganisms causing infection, the hepatitis patients had a significant increase in gram negative bacterial infections compared with the control group (74% vs. 61%) P=0.04. Our data suggest that chronic viral hepatitis is associated with a significant increase in overall infections, and that of potentially fatal infections involving CNS, lungs and bloodstream. Since there is no significant increase in the rate of graft rejection, one could consider a cautious reduction in the doses of maintenance immunosuppressive agents in renal transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The reduced immunosuppression may in turn lower the death rate from sepsis and progressive hepatic failure."
1085,0.001,1.0000,"Perinatal or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains the major risk factor for chronic HBV infection worldwide. In addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccination, oral antiviral therapies in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and maternal and fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy. A protocol was developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline writing committee. We searched multiple databases for controlled studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Outcomes of interest were reduction of MTCT and adverse outcomes to mothers and newborns. Study selection and data extraction were done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 26 studies that enrolled 3622 pregnant women. Antiviral therapy reduced MTCT, as defined by infant hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4) or infant HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5) at 6-12 months. No significant differences were found in the congenital malformation rate, prematurity rate, and Apgar scores. Compared to control, lamivudine or telbivudine improved maternal HBV DNA suppression at delivery and during 4-8 weeks' postpartum follow-up. Tenofovir showed improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery. No significant differences were found in postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and elevated creatinine kinase rates."
9601,0.001,1.0000,"In order to study the relation between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and malaria in women, during and after pregnancy, a prospective cohort study was initiated at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali in Rwanda through routine voluntary and confidential HIV screening in antenatal clinics. At inclusion in the cohort of all HIV-positive and an equivalent number of HIV-negative pregnant women, between 21 and 28 weeks of gestation, sociodemographic characteristics and medical history during the current pregnancy were collected; screening for malaria (tick blood smear) and anemia and a CD4 lymphocyte count were systematically performed. Each woman enrolled had a monthly follow-up until 6 months after delivery. A clinic was implemented that was accessible and free of charge to every woman during the study period between scheduled visits. Malaria infection was systematically screened in case of fever or other compatible symptoms. The cohort included 228 HIV-positive and 229 HIV-negative women. At inclusion, malaria prevalence was 8.0% in HIV-positive women and 3.5% in HIV-negative women (P < 0.04). Over the study period, the incidence of malaria was 6.2 per 100 women-months in the HIV-positive group and 3.5 in the HIV-negative group (relative risk [RR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.3). The bulk of the difference occurred postpartum. The Kaplan-Meier 9-month probability of remaining free of malaria infection was 51.8% in HIV-positive women and 65.2% in HIV-negative women (P = 0.013). When taking account in the same multivariate model (including HIV infection, primiparity, CD4 lymphocytes, anemia, and education level), positive HIV serostatus remained the only factor significantly associated with malaria infection (RR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.6; P = 0.016). Our study prospectively documents the association between malaria and maternal HIV infection and highlights the increased risk of malaria occurrence in all HIV-infected women. Strategies to reduce the malaria morbidity during pregnancy should be reinforced in areas of high HIV seroprevalence."
6892,0.001,1.0000,"The new recommendations reflect the increase in knowledge that has been reported since the release of previous Czech guidelines in September 2014. The basis for these guidelines were the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines from April 2017. According to qualified estimates, there are 240 million people with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection worldwide. The Czech Republic is among the countries with a low prevalence of HBV infection. According to the latest seroprevalence study, 0.56 % of the Czech citizens were chronically infected with HBV in 2001. A similar study conducted in only two regions of the Czech Republic in 2013 showed a prevalence of only 0.064 %. HBV infection can lead to serious life-threatening liver damage - fulminant hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The main goals of treatment are to prolong the length of life and improve its quality by preventing the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, cirrhosis decompensation and development of HCC. The goals may be achieved if HBV replication is suppressed in a sustained manner. Additional goals are prevention of vertical transmission from mother to newborn, inhibition of HBV reactivation and therapy of HBV-related extrahepatic manifestations. Generally, there are two different strategies of chronic hepatitis B therapy available - treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) or with pegylated interferon alfa. Currently, the vast majority of Czech and European patients are treated with NIs. The NIs that have been approved for HBV treatment in the European Union include lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir (ETV), telbivudin (TBV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). TAF and TBV have not yet been marketed in the Czech Republic. The main advantages of treatment with potent NIs with a high barrier to resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) are their predictable high long-term antiviral efficacy leading to undetectable HBV DNA levels in the vast majority of compliant patients as well as their favorable safety profiles. These drugs can be used in any HBV infected patient and represent the only treatment option for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplants, extrahepatic HBV-related manifestations, severe acute hepatitis B or chronic HBV reactivation."
4858,0.001,1.0000,"Immune clearance of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is characterized by broad and robust antiviral T cell responses, while virus-specific T cells in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are rare and exhibit immune exhaustion that includes programmed-death-1 (PD-1) expression on virus-specific T cells. Thus, an immunotherapy able to expand and activate virus-specific T cells may have therapeutic benefit for CHB patients. Like HBV-infected patients, woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) can have increased hepatic expression of PD-1-ligand-1 (PD-L1), increased PD-1 on CD8+ T cells, and a limited number of virus-specific T cells with substantial individual variation in these parameters. We used woodchucks infected with WHV to assess the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy (αPD-L1) in a variety of WHV infection states. Experimentally-infected animals lacked PD-1 or PD-L1 upregulation compared to uninfected controls, and accordingly, αPD-L1 treatment in lab-infected animals had limited antiviral effects. In contrast, animals with naturally acquired WHV infections displayed elevated PD-1 and PD-L1. In these same animals, combination therapy with αPD-L1 and entecavir (ETV) improved control of viremia and antigenemia compared to ETV treatment alone, but with efficacy restricted to a minority of animals. Pre-treatment WHV surface antigen (sAg) level was identified as a statistically significant predictor of treatment response, while PD-1 expression on peripheral CD8+ T cells, T cell production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) upon in vitro antigen stimulation (WHV ELISPOT), and circulating levels of liver enzymes were not. To further assess the safety of this strategy, αPD-L1 was tested in acute WHV infection to model the risk of liver damage when the extent of hepatic infection and antiviral immune responses were expected to be the greatest. No significant increase in serum markers of hepatic injury was observed over those in infected, untreated control animals. These data support a positive benefit/risk assessment for blockade of the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway in CHB patients and may help to identify patient groups most likely to benefit from treatment. Furthermore, the efficacy of αPD-L1 in only a minority of animals, as observed here, suggests that additional agents may be needed to achieve a more robust and consistent response leading to full sAg loss and durable responses through anti-sAg antibody seroconversion."
6487,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its associated diseases continue to increase despite the progress in our understanding of HIV biology and the availability of a number of antiretroviral drugs. Adherence is a significant factor in the success of HIV therapy and current HIV treatment regimens require a combination of antiviral drugs to be taken at least daily for the remainder of a patient's life. A drug delivery system that allows sustained drug delivery could reduce the medical burden and costs associated with medication nonadherence. Here, we describe a novel supramolecular assembly or matrix that contains an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid, cationic polymer poly-l-lysine, and anionic oligosaccharide sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors Zidovudine and Lamivudine were successfully encapsulated into the polymer assembly in a noncovalent manner. The physicochemical properties and antiviral activity of the polymer assemblies were studied. The results of this study suggest that the supramolecular assemblies loaded with HIV drugs exert potent antiviral activity and allow sustained drug release. A novel drug delivery formulation such as the one described here could facilitate our efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infections and could be utilized in the design of therapeutic approaches for other diseases."

Despite the great improvement of hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy and its high clinical efficacy, major influencing factors are still hindering and diminishing the effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment. This minimizes the quality of life of the infected patients and reduces the outcome of such therapy, particularly in certain groups of patients such as intravenous drug users and patients coinfected with human immune deficiency virus (HIV). A variety of factors were evolved either at patient individual level, healthcare providers, community surrounding levels, or healthcare setting systems. Analyzing and understanding these factors could help to improve HCV interventions and, thus, reduce the burden of such infection. The objectives of this paper were to highlight such factors and outline the holistic approaches that could be used to overcome such factors."
8063,0.001,1.0000,"A quantitative rapid assay to detect resistant clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains remains an important medical goal. A system incorporating a quantitative RNA.RNA hybridization assay that measures the amount of intracellular HIV-1-specific RNA has been employed to detect the level of inhibition by nucleoside analogues in sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains. The RNA.RNA hybridization assay readily distinguished previously published zidovudine (ZDV; 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-resistant isolates from ZDV-sensitive isolates of HIV-1. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZDV for HTLV-IIIB and sensitive clinical HIV-1 isolates is between 0.01 and 0.04 microM. HIV-1 strains from three patients on long-term ZDV therapy displayed a greater than 20-fold increase in the ZDV IC50 compared to sensitive strains. The drug sensitivity system was confirmed by showing that mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase gene from a ZDV-resistant isolate resulted in four amino acid changes (Leu-125----Trp, Ile-142----Val, Thr-215----Tyr, and Pro-294----Thr) including one change (Thr-215----Tyr) that has been previously reported to be associated with resistance. One clinical HIV strain with high-level ZDV resistance displayed a 5-fold increase in 2',3'-dideoxyinosine IC50 compared to that of HTLV-IIIB. A drug sensitivity assay employing RNA.RNA hybridization may be useful for extensive screening of HIV isolates from patients enrolled in clinical trials and permit the correlation of in vitro resistance with clinical outcome."

Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of all HIV+ individuals followed at one reference HIV outpatient clinic in Madrid. Liver fibrosis was measured in all cases using transient elastometry (FibroScan). All 2168 HIV+ patients on regular follow-up (76% males, 46% injecting drug users) were successfully examined by FibroScan) between October 2004 and August 2006. Liver cirrhosis was recognized in 181 (overall prevalence, 8.3%), and the main aetiologies were HCV, 82.3%; HBV, 1.6%; dual HBV/HCV, 2.8%; and triple HBV/HCV/ hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, 6.6%. The prevalence of cirrhosis differed among patients with distinct chronic viral hepatitis: HCV, 19.2%; HBV, 6.1%; HBV/HCV, 41.7%; and HBV/HCV/HDV, 66.7%. In 12 patients with cirrhosis (6.7%), no definite aetiology was recognized. Overall, cirrhotics had lower mean CD4 counts than noncirrhotics (408 vs 528 cells/microL respectively; P = 0.02), despite similar proportion of subjects with undetectable viraemia on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Clinical manifestations of liver cirrhosis were: splenomegaly, 61.5%; oesophageal varices, 59.8%; ascites, 22.6%; encephalopathy, 12.1%; and variceal bleeding, 6.1%. Liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation events are relatively frequent in HIV+ individuals. Chronic HCV and alcohol abuse, but not chronic HBV, play a major role.

This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection.

3223,0.001,1.0000,"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are promising non-virus-encoded targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy. We describe a selection procedure to isolate mutant forms of RANTES (CCL5) with antiviral activity considerably in excess of that of the native chemokine. The phage-displayed library of randomly mutated and N-terminally extended variants was screened by using live CCR5-expressing cells, and two of the selected mutants, P1 and P2, were further characterized. Both were significantly more potent HIV inhibitors than RANTES, with P2 being the most active (50% inhibitory concentration of 600 pM in a viral coat-mediated cell fusion assay, complete protection of target cells against primary HIV type 1 strains at a concentration of 10 nM). P2 resembles AOP-RANTES in that it is a superagonist of CCR5 and potently induces receptor sequestration. P1, while less potent than P2, has the advantage of significantly reduced signaling activity via CCR5 (30% of that of RANTES). Additionally, both P1 and P2 exhibit not only significantly increased affinity for CCR5 but also enhanced receptor selectivity, retaining only trace levels of signaling activity via CCR1 and CCR3. The phage chemokine approach that was successfully applied here could be adapted to other chemokine-chemokine receptor systems and used to further improve the first-generation mutants reported in this paper."
7198,0.001,1.0000,"The protease (PR) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential for viral replication: this aspartyl protease, active only as a dimer, is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors (Gag and Gag-Pol), to release the functional mature proteins. In this work, we have studied the structure-function relationships of the HIV PR by combining a genetic test to detect proteolytic activity in Escherichia coli and a bacterial two-hybrid assay to analyze PR dimerization. We showed that a drug-resistant PR variant isolated from a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is impaired in its dimerization capability and, as a consequence, is proteolytically inactive. We further showed that the polypeptide regions adjacent to the PR coding sequence in the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor, and in particular, the transframe polypeptide (TF), located at the N terminus of PR, can facilitate the dimerization of this variant PR and restore its enzymatic activity. We propose that the TF protein could help to compensate for folding and/or dimerization defects in PR arising from certain mutations within the PR coding sequence and might therefore function to buffer genetic variations in PR."
267,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection represents a risk factor for thrombotic microangiopathy. HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathies encompass two entities with distinct pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura associated with human immunodeficiency virus is typically characterized by a sudden onset in a patient with a moderate immune deficiency and a few events of opportunistic diseases, and a profound acquired deficiency in the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13. This diagnosis requires a well-codified management including daily therapeutic plasma exchanges, a highly active antiretroviral therapy and eventually immunomodulatory drugs. The prognosis is good with a response rate and an overall survival comparable to that of HIV-negative thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. On the opposite, HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy with a progressive onset that occurs in profoundly immunocompromised patients with past history of multiple opportunistic diseases usually have a detectable ADAMTS13 activity and a worse prognosis. Usual treatment is poorly efficient. Forthcoming studies should assess the role of immunomodulatory drugs such as rituximab in the setting of HIV-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, and identify possible risk factors associated with the occurrence of these diseases."
5290,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, a chronic and incurable disease of the human immune system. As the standard of care for the patients with HIV-1, current highly active antiretroviral treatment has been therapeutically effective in most patients; however, it is not curative, and highly active antiretroviral treatment is intolerable because of severe adverse effects. Therefore, nucleic acid-based therapeutics, such as antisense oligonucleotide, ribozyme, messenger RNA, RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutics, aptamer, and so on, have been actively developed as alternative or adjuvant agents for those chemical antiviral drugs to surmount those drawbacks. The combinatorial use of various antiviral nucleic acids could be more efficacious in blocking viral replication and preventing the emergence of resistant variants. In this regard, RNAi can function as a gene-specific therapeutic option for controlling HIV-1 replication. Another type of therapeutic nucleic acid--aptamers--shows promise as a new and potent class of anti-HIV agent and can additionally function as a cell-type-specific delivery vehicle for targeted RNAi. The combined use of small interfering RNA (siRNAs) and aptamers could effectively block viral replication and prevent the emergence of resistant variants. The present review offers a brief overview of the use of cell-type-specific aptamer and aptamer-siRNA conjugates' development in our group for the treatment of HIV-1. Their potentials for targeted delivering RNAi therapeutics (eg, siRNA) and suppressing HIV-1 replication in vitro and in humanized animal model will be highlighted here."
3986,0.001,1.0000,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."
7193,0.001,1.0000,"Here the authors discuss evidence in human and animal models supporting two opposing views regarding the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the central nervous system (CNS): (1) HIV infection in the CNS is a compartmentalized infection, with the virus-infected macrophages entering the CNS early, infecting resident microglia and astrocytes, and achieving a state of latency with evolution toward a fulminant CNS infection late in the course of disease; or alternatively, (2) events in the periphery lead to altered monocyte/macrophage (MPhi) homeostasis, with increased CNS invasion of infected and/or uninfected MPhis. Here the authors have reevaluated evidence presented in the favor of the latter model, with a discussion of phenotypic characteristics distinguishing normal resident microglia with those accumulating in HIV encephalitis (HIVE). CD163 is normally expressed by perivascular MPhi s but not resident microglia in normal CNS of humans and rhesus macaques. In agreement with other studies, the authors demonstrate expression of CD163 by brain MPhi s in HIVE and simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (SIVE). CNS tissues from HIV-sero positive individuals with HIVE or HIV-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were also examined. In HIVE, the authors further demonstrate colocalization of CD163 and CD16 (Fcgamma III recptor) gene expression, the latter marker associated with HIV infection of monocyte in vivo and permissivity of infection. Indeed, CD163(+) MPhis and microglia are often productively infected in HIVE CNS. In SIV infected rhesus macaques, CD163(+) cells accumulate perivascularly, within nodular lesions and the parenchyma in animals with encephalitis. Likewise, parenchymal microglia and perivascular MPhi s are CD163(+) in HIVE. In contrast to HIVE, CD163(+)perivascular and parenchymal MPhi s in HIV-associated PML were only associated with areas of demyelinating lesions. Interestingly, SIV-infected rhesus macaques whose viral burden was predominantly at 1 x 10(6) copies/ml or greater developed encephalitis. To further investigate the relationship between CD163(+)/CD16(+) MPhis/microglia in the CNS and altered homeostasis in the periphery, the authors performed flow-cytometric analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The results demonstrate an increase in the percent frequency of CD163(+)/CD16(+) monocytes in animals with detectable virus that correlated significantly with increased viral burden and CD4(+) T-cell decline. These results suggest the importance of this monocyte subset in HIV/SIV CNS disease, and also in the immune pathogenesis of lentiviral infection. The authors further discuss the potential role of CD163(+)/CD16(+) monocyte/MPhi subset expansion, altered myeloid homeostasis, and potential consequences for immune polarization and suppression. The results and discussion here suggest new avenues for the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) therapeutics and vaccine design."
2151,0.001,1.0000,"Five regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) have been shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation of HIV in HeLa cells. These include the negative regulatory, enhancer, SP1, TATA, and TAR regions. Previous studies in which purified SP1 was used showed that the three SP1-binding sites in the HIV LTR were important in the in vitro transcription of this promoter. However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these SP1-binding sites in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation in vivo have been reported. To determine the role of SP1 sites in transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR in vivo, these sites were subjected to oligonucleotide mutagenesis both individually and in groups. The constructs were tested by DNase I footprinting with both oligonucleotide affinity column-purified SP1 and partially purified HeLa extract and by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in both the presence and absence of the tat gene. Mutagenesis of each SP1-binding site resulted in minimal changes in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. Mutations involving alterations of SP1 sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. However, mutagenesis of all three SP1-binding sites resulted in a marked decrease in tat induction. The latter mutation also greatly decreased DNase I protection over the enhancer, TATA, and TAR regions when partially purified HeLa nuclear extract was used. Mutagenesis of the HIV LTR SP1 sites which converted them to consensus high-affinity SP1-binding sites with the sequence GGGGCGGGGC resulted in increased tat-induced gene expression compared with the wild-type HIV LTR template. These results suggest that SP1, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, is critical for in vivo transcriptional regulation of HIV."
2198,0.001,1.0000,"Polymorphisms of genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, particularly those encoding HLA-DR, have been suggested as markers of susceptibility to Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). We conducted a case-control study comparing 147 homosexual men who developed KS after infection by human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) with 147 matched dually infected men without HIV-associated KS (HIV-KS) from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. HLA-B, DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, and DQB1 polymorphisms were examined by high-resolution DNA-based methods. Differences in distributions of genetic variants were tested by conditional logistic regression. Previously reported relationships with HLA-DRB1 alleles could not be confirmed. Instead, other associations were observed. In univariate analysis, KS was weakly associated with B*2702/5 (odds ratio (OR)=0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.18-0.91). Similar or stronger associations, positive or negative, were seen for haplotypes containing class II alleles: DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 (OR=3.67, 95% CI=1.02-13.1), DRB4 (DR53) haplotype family members [OR=0.52, 95% CI=0.32-0.85], and DRB3 (DR52) haplotype family members (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.07-2.67). The B*1402-DRB1*0102 haplotype, which invariably contains the V281L mutation in the 21-hydroxylase gene governing adrenal steroid biosynthesis, occurred in five cases and one control (OR=5.0, 95% CI=0.58-42.8). In a final multivariable analysis, only DRB1*1302-DQB1*0604 (OR=6.43, 95% CI=1.28-32.3, P=0.02) remained significantly associated with KS. Associations of HLA-DRB families with HIV-KS could reflect underlying immune dysregulation. The HLA B*1402-DRB1*0102 haplotype associated with increased risk of KS might represent an antigen-presenting pathway unfavorable for immune response to HHV8. Alternatively, the relationship might hold a clue to the predilection of KS for men because that haplotype harbors the mutant form of the 21-hydroxylase gene."
4228,0.001,1.0000,"The present study sought to extend prior work, showing an association between self-reported distress tolerance and self-reported antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence, by conducting a multimethod test of the association between distress tolerance and objective measures of ART adherence among a sample of 140 individuals (23.6% female) with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Findings indicated that, after accounting for negative affectivity and ART side-effect severity, distress tolerance was significantly associated with pill count adherence as well as viral load. Specifically, a differential association was observed whereby self-reported distress tolerance was associated with pill count adherence, whereas behavioral distress tolerance was associated with viral load. Importantly, no associations were observed between either measure of distress tolerance and CD4 count. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of both behavioral and perceived distress tolerance assessment among patients with HIV as well as potential clinical implications related to the integration of distress tolerance-focused treatments into existing interventions for individuals with HIV."

Lesotho has a generalized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic (2). In 2014, the prevalence of HIV infection among persons aged 15-49 years was 24.6%, with an incidence of 1.9 new infections per 100 person-years of exposure (3). As the leading cause of premature death, HIV/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) has contributed to Lesotho's reporting the shortest life expectancy at birth among 195 countries and territories (4). In 2015, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among HIV-positive persons in Lesotho was estimated to be 42% (5). In April 2016, Lesotho became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for universal initiation of antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-positive persons, regardless of CD4 count (known as the ""Test and Start"" program or approach), with nationwide implementation occurring in June 2016 (6,7). Before implementation of Test and Start, many persons living with HIV infection in Lesotho were not eligible to initiate treatment until their CD4 count was <500 cells/mm"
6921,0.001,1.0000,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."
9568,0.001,1.0000,"Rabies virus (RV) vaccine strain-based vectors show great promise as vaccines against other viral diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and hepatitis C, but a low residual pathogenicity remains a concern for their use. Here we describe several highly attenuated second-generation RV-based vaccine vehicles expressing HIV-1 Gag. For this approach, we modified the previously described RV vaccine vector SPBN by replacing the arginine at position 333 (R333) within the RV glycoprotein (G) with glutamic acid (E333), deleting 43 amino acids of the RV G cytoplasmic domain (CD), or combining the R333 exchange and the CD deletion. In addition, we constructed a new RV vector that expresses HIV-1 Gag from an RV transcription unit upstream of the RV phosphoprotein gene (BNSP-Gag) instead of upstream of the G gene. As expected and as demonstrated for SPBN-Gag, all vaccine vehicles were apathogenic after peripheral administration. However, the new, second-generation vaccine vectors containing modifications in the RV G were also apathogenic after intracranial infection with 10(5) infectious particles, and BNSP-Gag produced a 50%-reduced mortality in mice. Of note, the observed attenuation of pathogenicity did not result in either the attenuation of the humoral response against the RV G or the previously observed robust cellular response against HIV-1 Gag. These findings demonstrate that very safe and highly effective RV-based vaccines can be constructed and further emphasize their potential utility as efficacious antiviral vaccines."
6915,0.001,1.0000,"Our aim was to characterize for the first time the genetic diversity of HIV in Cape Verde Islands as well as the drug resistance profiles in treated and untreated patients. Blood specimens were collected from 41 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 patients living in Santiago Island. Half of the patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Pol and env gene sequences were obtained using in-house methods. Phylogenetic analysis was used for viral subtyping and the Stanford Algorithm was used for resistance genotyping. For HIV-1, the amplification of pol and env was possible in 27 patients (66%). HIV-1 patients were infected with subtypes G (13, 48%), B (2, 7%), F1 (2, 7%), and CRF02_AG (2, 7%), and complex recombinant forms including a new C/G variant (n=8, 30%). Drug resistance mutations were detected in the PR and RT of three (10%) treated patients. M41L and K103N transmitted drug resistance mutations were found in 2 of 17 (12%) untreated patients. All 14 HIV-2 isolates belonged to group A. The origin of 12 strains was impossible to determine whereas two strains were closely related to the historic ROD strain. In conclusion, in Cape Verde there is a long-standing HIV-2 epidemic rooted in ROD-like strains and a more recent epidemic of unknown origin. The HIV-1 epidemic is caused by multiple subtypes and complex recombinant forms. Drug resistance HIV-1 strains are present at moderate levels in both treated and untreated patients. Close surveillance in these two populations is crucial to prevent further transmission of drug-resistant strains."
1984,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) from 76 adult immigrants in Australia from Myanmar was characterized to determine the prevalence of different HBV genotypes and subgenotypes. A mutational analysis was then performed to determine the presence of clinically significant mutations and correlate them to clinical outcomes. Initial genotyping revealed 68 patients with genotype C (89.5%) and eight patients with genotype B (10.5%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the large majority of the genotype C infections were of subgenotype C1 (67/68). Sequencing of the HBV polymerase gene (and overlapping surface gene) revealed no mutations associated with antiviral resistance. HBV surface gene mutations were detected in 10 patients with subgenotype C1. HBV BCP/PC sequencing was obtained for 71/76 (93%) patients. BCP and/or PC mutations were identified in 57/71 (80%) of PCR positive patients. Treatment had been commenced for 15/76 (18%) patients, a further 26 untreated patients were in a stage of disease where HBV treatment would be considered standard of care. It was identified that genotype C1 is the predominant sub-genotype in this population. Genotype C is known to be associated with increased risk of development of HCC. This highlights the need for screening for HCC given the potential for the development of liver cancer. It was also identified that people with HBV were potentially not receiving optimal therapy in a timely fashion."

His serum alanine aminotransferase level was 1200 IU/mL and CD4 cells count was 268/mm3. Antiretroviral therapy including tenofovir and emtricitabine, which suppresses both HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, was initiated. The liver enzymes decreased dramatically. The viral loads of both HIV-1 and HBV were suppressed below detectable limits. Seroconversion from hepatitis B surface antigen to hepatitis B surface antibody was acquired 19 weeks later. In this case, the initiation of antiretroviral therapy with anti-HBV activity during the acute phase of hepatitis B had a favourable effect on HBV serostatus."
28,0.001,1.0000,"The incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been declining thanks to the universal hepatitis B infant immunization program. Nevertheless, young adults born before the program implementation might have acquired HBV in early childhood or remain susceptible to infection. This study aimed to evaluate hepatitis B epidemiology in asymptomatic young adult population in Ternate, eastern Indonesia. Serum samples of 376 subjects (aged 17-25, mean 19.82 ± 1.69 years; male/female 138/238) were screened for HBV parameters serologically (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]; its antibody [anti-HBs]; anti-core antigen [anti-HBc]), and molecularly (HBV DNA). HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA prevalence were 15.7%, 36.2%, 24.2%, and 27.9%, respectively, with male predominance. Of all subjects, 13.0% were HBsAg negative with detectable HBV DNA (occult hepatitis B [OHB]), and 56.4% showed negativity for all seromarkers. This population showed high hepatitis B prevalence with substantial occurrence of OHB. However, a high percentage of the population were still susceptible and at risk of HBV infection. This study emphasizes the necessity to improve prevention strategies to screen and manage HBV carriers, including the adoption of catch-up or booster vaccination targeted to young adult populations. Investigations on the roles of host-virus interactions associated with OHB and its implications are warranted. "
7144,0.001,1.0000,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance. While great progress has been made in treating hepatitis B, many important issues require further study."

However, limited data is available regarding these risks to forensic medical personnel who are exposed daily to large numbers of severely traumatized bodies in South Africa, a country that has an existing and growing HIV epidemic and a high HBV seroprevalence. Because no specific prescriptions ensuring occupational safety in this regard exist for forensic medical personnel in South Africa, the prevalence of bloodborne viruses within this setting must be determined. Blood was taken randomly from 263 bodies examined at the Medicolegal Laboratory in Pretoria. Serologic tests to detect antibodies to HIV, HCV, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II) and to detect the presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) were performed and positive results confirmed using conventional serologic assays. Serologic tests detected at least one of the four bloodborne viruses in 21% of cases. The overall seroprevalence for HIV-1/2 was 11%, rising to 19% in the sexually active reproductive age group (15 - 49 years). The HBsAg prevalence overall was 8%, rising to 9% in sexually active reproductive individuals. There was a low overall HCV seroprevalence of 1% and an even lower HTLV-I/II seroprevalence of 0.01%. Forensic medical personnel in South Africa are therefore at risk of exposure to bloodborne viral pathogens in, on average, 1 of 5 bodies autopsied. This risk is compounded by the high daily workload, traumatized state of many of the bodies, and adverse working conditions. It is imperative that occupational health safety guidelines be created for the forensic medicine discipline and crime scene attendants in South Africa."

Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."
436,0.001,1.0000,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring free radical with many functions. The oxidized form of NO, the nitrosonium ion, reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues resulting in their modification to S-nitrosothiols. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (HIV-PR) has two cysteine residues that are conserved amongst different viral isolates found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In an active dimer, these residues are located near the surface of the protease. We have found that treatment of HIV-PR with different NO congeners results in loss of its proteolytic activity and simultaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols. Sodium nitroprusside inhibited HIV-PR up to 70% and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine completely inhibited the protease within 5 min of treatment. The pattern of inhibition by NO donors is comparable to its inhibition by N-acetyl pepstatin. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the modification of HIV-PR by NO as that of S-nitrosation. Our findings point towards a possible role of NO in mediating resistance to HIV-1 infection."
2466,0.001,1.0000,"Our work aimed to examine the potential influence of variants in interleukin/interleukin receptors genes on high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV clearance. Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R).

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of TNF-α polymorphism [-863C/A (rs1800630), -308G/A (rs1800629), -376G/A (rs1800750), -857C/T (rs1799724) and +489G/A (rs1800610)] in the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection.

However, the role of IL-21+CD4+ T cells in the immune response against chronic hepatitis C (CHC) virus infection is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of IL-21+CD4+ T cells in CHC patients and the potential mechanisms. The study subjects included nineteen CHC patients who were grouped by viral load (low, < 10(6) RNA copies/ml, n = 8; high, > 10(6) RNA copies/ml, n = 11). The peripheral frequency of HCV-specific IL-21+CD4+ T cells was higher in the low viral load group and was negatively correlated with the serum HCV RNA viral load in all CHC patients. Meanwhile, IL-21+ cells accumulated in the liver in the low viral load group. In vitro, IL-21 treatment increased the expression of proliferation markers and cytolytic molecules on HCV-specific CD8+ T cells. In summary, these findings suggest that HCV-specific IL-21+CD4+ T cells might contribute to HCV control by rescuing HCV-specific CD8+ T cells in CHC patients. "
767,0.001,1.0000,"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are essential for the control of viral liver infections, such as those caused by HBV or HCV. It is not entirely clear whether CD4+ T-cell help is necessary for establishing anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses that successfully control liver infection. To address the role of CD4+ T cells in acute viral hepatitis, we infected mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) of the strain WE; LCMV-WE causes acute hepatitis in mice and is cleared from the liver by CD8+ T cells within about two weeks. The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA-/- mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion. We found that CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice developed protracted viral liver infection, which seemed to be a consequence of reduced virus-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers in the liver. Moreover, the anti-viral effector functions of the liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation with LCMV peptide, notably the IFN-γ production and degranulation capacity were impaired in CIITA-/- mice. The impaired CD8+ T-cell function in CIITA-/- mice was not associated with increased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our findings indicate that CD4+ T-cell help is required to establish an effective antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the liver during acute viral infection. Insufficient virus control and protracted viral hepatitis may be consequences of impaired initial CD4+ T-cell help. "
385,0.001,1.0000,"Bias in cytokine responses has been proposed as a contributing mechanism to pathogenesis in persistent HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. We investigated whether coinfection with HCV modifies the profile of antigen-specific cytokine secretion in women persistently infected with HIV compared to women with single HIV or HCV infection. The T helper response to HIV, HCV and cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a positive viral control was dominated by type 1 cytokines (interleukin- [IL] 2, interferon- [IFN] gamma and tumor necrosis factor- [TNF] alpha), with IFN-gamma as the most abundantly secreted. IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 were low in healthy controls and patients. Robust CMV-specific responses contrasted with curtailed HCV-specific responses in HCV-infected women.

Here, we investigated hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) genetic features underlying this phenomenon by analyzing 93 patients: 29 developing HBV reactivation and 64 consecutive patients with chronic HBV infection (as control). HBsAg genetic diversity was analyzed by population-based and ultradeep sequencing (UDS). Before HBV reactivation, 51.7% of patients were isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive, 31.0% inactive carriers, 6.9% anti-HBc/anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody) positive, 6.9% isolated anti-HBs positive, and 3.4% had an overt HBV infection. Of HBV-reactivated patients, 51.7% were treated with rituximab, 34.5% with different chemotherapeutics, and 13.8% with corticosteroids only for inflammatory diseases. In total, 75.9% of HBV-reactivated patients (vs. 3.1% of control patients; P<0.001) carried HBsAg mutations localized in immune-active HBsAg regions. Of the 13 HBsAg mutations found in these patients, 8 of 13 (M103I-L109I-T118K-P120A-Y134H-S143L-D144E-S171F) reside in a major hydrophilic loop (target of neutralizing antibodies [Abs]); some of them are already known to hamper HBsAg recognition by humoral response. The remaining five (C48G-V96A-L175S-G185E-V190A) are localized in class I/II-restricted T-cell epitopes, suggesting a role in HBV escape from T-cell-mediated responses. By UDS, these mutations occurred in HBV-reactivated patients with a median intrapatient prevalence of 73.3% (range, 27.6%-100%) supporting their fixation in the viral population as a predominant species. In control patients carrying such mutations, their median intrapatient prevalence was 4.6% (range, 2.5%-11.3%; P<0.001). Finally, additional N-linked glycosylation (NLG) sites within the major hydrophilic loop were found in 24.1% of HBV-reactivated patients (vs. 0% of chronic patients; P<0.001); 5 of 7 patients carrying these sites remained HBsAg negative despite HBV reactivation. NLG can mask immunogenic epitopes, abrogating HBsAg recognition by Abs."
4636,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play an important role in the regulation of immune response against infectious organisms, including HBV. Recently, several genome-wide association (GWAS) studies have shown that genetic variations in HLA genes influence disease progression in HBV infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HLA genetic polymorphisms and their possible role in HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. Variations in HLA genes were screened in 1672 subjects who were divided according to their clinical status into six categories as follows; clearance group, inactive carriers, active carriers, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and uninfected healthy controls. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belonged to HLA-DQ region (rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572) and two SNPs belonged to HLA-DP (rs3077 and rs9277535) were studied. The SNPs were genotyped by PCR-based DNA sequencing (rs2856718) and allele specific TaqMan genotyping assays (rs3077, rs7453920, rs9277535 and rs9275572). The results showed that rs2856718, rs3077, rs9277535 and rs9275572 were associated with HBV infection (p = 0.0003, OR = 1.351, CI = 1.147-1.591; p = 0.041, OR = 1.20, CI = 1.007-1.43; p = 0.045, OR = 1.198, CI = 1.004-1.43 and p = 0.0018, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.662-0.910, respectively). However, allele frequency of rs2856718, rs7453920 and rs9275572 were found more in chronically infected patients when compared to clearance group infection (p = 0.0001, OR = 1.462, CI = 1.204-1.776; p = 0.0178, OR = 1.267, CI = 1.042-1.540 and p = 0.010, OR = 0.776, CI = 0.639-0.942, respectively). No association was found when polymorphisms in HLA genes were compared in active carriers versus cirrhosis/HCC patients. In conclusion, these results suggest that variations in HLA genes could affect susceptibility to and clearance of HBV infection in Saudi Arabian patients. "
505,0.001,1.0000,"Symptomatic HIV infection was first diagnosed in an Irish child in 1985. A prospective study was initiated to determine the vertical transmission rate (VTR) of HIV and the average age of infant seroreversion and to monitor clinical, immunologic and virologic evidence for HIV infection in seroreverters. Ninety three HIV positive infants have been prospectively identified since 1985. The predominant underlying maternal risk factor for HIV infection is intravenous drug use (IVDU) (96 per cent). Of 93 infants, median gestational age was 40 weeks and median birth weight 3125 grams. Ninety-four per cent of infants were bottle fed. Currently 72 (77 per cent) infants are uninfected, 12 (13 per cent) are infected, 4 (4.5 per cent) are indeterminate and 5 (5.5 per cent) have been lost to follow up. The intermediate estimate of vertical transmission rate (VTR) is 14.3 per cent. The median age at documented seroreversion was 12 months. There are no significant differences between infected and non-infected children in male/female ratio, gestational age, mode of delivery or birth weight. Strategies to reduce the transmission of HIV among drug users in combination with routine antenatal screening and antiretroviral prophylaxis of vertical transmission are all measures which can reduce HIV infection in our children."
7152,0.001,1.0000,"Pharmacologically-induced activation of replication competent proviruses from latency in the presence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been proposed as a step towards curing HIV-1 infection. However, until now, approaches to reverse HIV-1 latency in humans have yielded mixed results. Here, we report a proof-of-concept phase Ib/IIa trial where 6 aviremic HIV-1 infected adults received intravenous 5 mg/m2 romidepsin (Celgene) once weekly for 3 weeks while maintaining ART. Lymphocyte histone H3 acetylation, a cellular measure of the pharmacodynamic response to romidepsin, increased rapidly (maximum fold range: 3.7–7.7 relative to baseline) within the first hours following each romidepsin administration. Concurrently, HIV-1 transcription quantified as copies of cell-associated un-spliced HIV-1 RNA increased significantly from baseline during treatment (range of fold-increase: 2.4–5.0; p = 0.03). Plasma HIV-1 RNA increased from <20 copies/mL at baseline to readily quantifiable levels at multiple post-infusion time-points in 5 of 6 patients (range 46–103 copies/mL following the second infusion, p = 0.04). Importantly, romidepsin did not decrease the number of HIV-specific T cells or inhibit T cell cytokine production. Adverse events (all grade 1–2) were consistent with the known side effects of romidepsin. In conclusion, romidepsin safely induced HIV-1 transcription resulting in plasma HIV-1 RNA that was readily detected with standard commercial assays demonstrating that significant reversal of HIV-1 latency in vivo is possible without blunting T cell-mediated immune responses. These finding have major implications for future trials aiming to eradicate the HIV-1 reservoir."
2173,0.001,1.0000,"Prolonged viral suppression with oral antiviral drugs allows partial immune reconstitution. Controlled therapy interruption (CTI), by leveraging secondary immune response, proposes further augmentation in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Transient treatment interruptions (TIs) at months 0, 1, and 3 during otherwise continuous oral antiviral therapy allow viremic bursts, simulating autovaccination. Four weekly injections of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin are given before the second and third TI to simulate prime boosting, which specifically amplifies the immune response. Fourteen patients (10 males; four controls, four HBeAg positive, and six anti-HBe positive) aged 28-46 years were studied. The period between TI and reappearance of viremia, time to relapse (TTR) (weeks) estimated immune control. The other endpoints included reduction in serum HBsAg IU/mL and loss of HBeAg. TTR after the first TI was significantly shorter in HBeAg-positive patients, indicating low baseline immunity. TTR increased significantly after the second and subsequent TI in all four HBeAg-positive patients. One patient persistently lost HBeAg. Mean HBsAg levels fell significantly in three of four patients after the second TI. In contrast, in the anti-HBe-positive group, TTR was unchanged after all three TI. Furthermore, no significant changes in HBsAg levels were detected after the second or subsequent TIs. No significant differences in adverse events were noted between groups. HBeAg-positive patients have low baseline levels of host immune control against HBV. CTI consistently boosts this immunity. CTI did not influence immunity in anti-HBe-positive patients. "
7566,0.001,1.0000,"Expression of HLA-B57 is associated with restricted replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the mechanism for its protective effect remains unknown. If this advantage depends upon CD8 T-cell recognition of B57-restricted epitopes, mother-to-child transmission of escape mutations within these epitopes could nullify its protective effect. However, if the B57 advantage is largely mediated by selection for fitness-attenuating viral mutations within B57-restricted epitopes, such as T242N in TW10-Gag, then the transmission of such mutations could facilitate viral control in the haploidentical infant. We assessed the consequences of B57-associated mutations on replication capacity, viral control, and clinical outcome after vertical transmission in 13 mother-child pairs. We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57. In contrast, most B57-negative infants born to B57-positive mothers progressed rapidly to AIDS. The presence of T242N led to a reproducible reduction in viral fitness, as demonstrated by in vitro assays using NL4-3 constructs encoding p24 sequences from individual mothers and infants. Associated compensatory mutations within p24-Gag were observed to reverse this impairment and to influence the propensity of T242N to revert after transmission to B57-negative hosts. Moreover, primary failure to control viremia was observed in one infant to whom multiple compensatory mutations were transmitted along with T242N. These parallel in vivo and in vitro data suggest that HLA-B57 confers its advantage primarily by driving and maintaining a fitness-attenuating mutation in p24-Gag."
1863,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. While infection of macrophages by HIV-1 is generally not cytopathic, it does impair macrophage function. In this study, we examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on intracellular signaling in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) stimulated with the growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is an important growth factor for cells of both the macrophage and granulocyte lineages and enhances effector functions of these cells via the heterodimeric GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR). A major pathway which mediates the effects of GM-CSF on macrophages involves activation of the latent transcription factor STAT5A via a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-dependent pathway. We demonstrate that GM-CSF-induced activation of STAT5A is inhibited in MDM after infection in vitro with the laboratory-adapted R5 strain of HIV-1, HIV-1(Ba-L), but not after infection with adenovirus. HIV-1 infection of MDM did not decrease the STAT5A or JAK2 mRNA level or STAT5A protein level or result in increased constitutive activation of STAT5A. Surface expression of either the alpha-chain or common beta(c)-chain of GM-CSFR was also unaffected. We conclude that HIV-1 inhibits GM-CSF activation of STAT5A without affecting expression of the known components of the signaling pathway. These data provide further evidence of disruption of cellular signaling pathways after HIV-1 infection, which may contribute to immune dysfunction and HIV-1 pathogenesis."
9184,0.001,1.0000,"The viral regulatory gene, nef, is unique to the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) and their related primate lentiviruses. Expression of the nef gene has been shown to be essential to the maintenance of high levels of virus replication and the development of pathogenesis in the animal model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection. In contrast to this in vivo model, the use of standard T cell culture systems to study nef function in vitro has produced a spectrum of contradictory results, and has failed to demonstrate a significant positive influence of nef on viral life cycle. We have developed a cell model to study regulation of HIV-1 replication that we believe reflects more accurately virus-cell interactions as they occur in vivo. Our experimental system used acute virus infection of purified, quiescent CD4 lymphocytes and subsequent induction of viral replication through T cell activation. With this cell model, NL4-3 virus clones with open and mutated nef reading frames were compared for replication competence. The clones with nef mutations showed reproducible and significant reductions in both rates of growth and maximal titers achieved. The degree of reduced replication was dependent on initial virus inoculum and the timing of T cell activation. The influence of nef was highly significant for induction of virus replication from a latent state within resting CD4 cells. Its effect was less apparent for virus infection of fully proliferating CD4 cells. This study demonstrates that nef confers a positive growth advantage to HIV-1 that becomes readily discernable in the primary cell setting of virus induction through T cell activation. The experimental cell model, which we describe here, provides not only a means to study nef function in vitro, but also provides important clues to the function of nef in HIV infection in vivo."
5309,0.001,1.0000,"The importance of HLA class I-restricted CD8 T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is generally accepted. While several studies have shown an association of certain HLA class I alleles with slower disease progression, it is not fully established whether this effect is mediated by HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses restricted by these alleles. In order to study the influence of the HLA class I alleles on the HIV-specific CD8 T-cell response and on viral control, we have assessed HIV-specific epitope recognition, plasma viral load, and expression of HLA class I alleles in a cohort of HIV-seropositive bar workers. Possession of the HLA class I alleles B5801, B8101, and B0702 was associated with a low median viral load and simultaneously with a broader median recognition of Gag epitopes compared to all other HLA alleles (twofold increase) (P = 0.0035). We further found an inverse linear relationship between the number of Gag epitopes recognized and the plasma viral load (R = -0.36; P = 0.0016). Particularly, recognition of multiple epitopes within two regions of Gag (amino acids [aa] 1 to 75 and aa 248 to 500) was associated with the maintenance of a low steady-state viremia, even years after acute infection."
3639,0.001,1.0000,"Abstract Our objective was to evaluate the liver toxicity of antiretroviral regimens including fosamprenavir plus ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400/100 mg once daily (QD) in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. This was a prospective cohort study that included 117 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who started FPV/r 1400/100 mg QD-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who neither had received a previous antiretroviral regimen containing FPV nor had a past history of virologic failure while receiving protease inhibitors (PI). The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of grade 3-4 liver enzymes elevations (LEE) within 1 year after starting FPV/r QD. Factors potentially associated with grade 3-4 LEE, including baseline liver fibrosis, were analyzed. Eleven (9%) patients had a grade 3-4 LEE during the follow-up, resulting in an incidence of severe liver toxicity of 9% (95% confidence interval 4.1-14.6%). None of these cases led to FPV/r discontinuation. Baseline liver fibrosis could be assessed in 97 (83%) patients. Six of 71 patients (8%) with significant fibrosis had a grade 3-4 LEE versus 2 of 26 (8%) without significant fibrosis (p=1.0). Twenty (21%) patients had cirrhosis at baseline. There were no cases of LEE among cirrhotics. In conclusion, the incidence of severe liver toxicity after 1 year of therapy with FPV/r QD-based ART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is similar to what has been reported with other boosted PIs. In addition, the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis was not associated with the emergence of liver toxicity. Thus, ART regimens containing FPV/r QD may be considered safe in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, including those with cirrhosis."
7783,0.001,1.0000,"In up to 50% of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, the nervous system is clinically involved. Primary or secondary manifestations of the nervous system have been found in even 90% by neuropathological investigations. We present a retrospective analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum data of 238 HIV patients. Data of cross-sectional analysis in 208 patients and longitudinal analysis in 30 patients are given. In addition, the viral load in CSF and serum was determined in 29 patients. The HIV patients without opportunistic infections showed increased levels of immunoglobulins and more oligoclonal bands. In later stages of the infection, beta-2 microglobulin as a marker of HIV-associated encephalopathy was increased. In the longitudinal study with an observation period of 1 year, an increase could be observed in total CSF proteins of patients who did not receive antiretroviral treatment. In patients with new opportunistic infections of the central nervous system, similar changes in CSF parameters were noted as in comparison to patients not infected by HIV but with the same opportunistic infections. Analysis of CSF is mandatory for the diagnosis and control of opportunistic infections."
6182,0.001,1.0000,"Despite a decade of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, a few individuals termed as long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) maintain a stable CD4+ T-cell count for a period of time. The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."
757,0.001,1.0000,"A prospective, cross-sectional study was designed to determine the magnetic resonance relaxation times of cerebral white matter in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. T1 and T2 were estimated at 1.5 T using four-point methods. Seventy-five HIV-1 seropositive subjects, 48 seronegative blood donors, and 17 seronegative homosexual men were studied. Associations between relaxometry and clinical classification, neurological status, immunological status, and qualitative MRI were investigated. Statistically significant differences in white matter T1 relaxation time were found comparing low-risk control and AIDS groups (p < .005), seropositive subjects with neurological signs and those without (p < .005), and subjects with low (CD4 < or = 200 x 10(6)/l) and high (CD4 > 200 x 10(6)/1) CD4 cell counts (p < .05). These findings add to the body of information that reveals no HIV-related change in the brain before the onset of symptomatic immunosuppression and go someway to validating the previous visually rated, qualitative findings. Statistically significant difference in white matter T2 relaxation time were also found comparing the two control groups (p < .005) highlighting the need for appropriate controls."
7302,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."
945,0.001,1.0000,"The growing elderly population of HIV-infected patients is leading to a significant epidemiological transition and HIV infection has been proposed as a premature and accelerated aging model rending the individual more susceptible to premature disability. However, the determinants of disability among this emergent population are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the correlates of prevalent disability in adults ≥50 years with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study of 184 HIV-infected adults receiving ambulatory care in an HIV clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City was conducted. Disability for instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) was established. Sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, current CD4(+) cell count, and HIV viral load (VL) were tested as potential determinants of disability. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the correlates of both types of disability. The mean age was 59.3 years. All participants were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Of participants 17.9% had disability for IADL and 26.1% for ADL. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older; having a lower CD4(+) cell count, and having a detectable HIV VL were independently associated with both types of disability. In addition, educational level was also independently associated with ADL disability. Age, educational level, low CD4(+) cell count, and detectable HIV VL were independently associated with disability. Whether effective and timely antiretroviral therapy will reduce the risk of disability in HIV-infected elderly patients needs to be evaluated. "

In 2010, 305 men who have sex with men infected with HIV and 100 HIV-seronegative men who have sex with men were recruited. Genital swabs were collected and 37 HPV genotypes were detected using linear array HPV genotyping. HPV infection was present in 45.3% of the patients infected with HIV and in 18% of the HIV-negative subjects (P < 0.001). HPV types 52, 51, and 16 were the most commonly identified oncogenic types. Oncogenic HPV types were identified in 31.2% of the patients infected with HIV and in 13% of the seronegative subjects (P < 0.001). Adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for the detection of any HPV type were 2.9 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-5.9) for men who have sex with men aged 30-34 and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-4.3) for those aged >35 compared with that for those aged <25. ORs were 2.8 (95% CI, 1.0-7.4) for a CD4+ T cell count of 200-350 cells/µl and 8.5 (95% CI, 2.9-24.5) for a CD4+ T cell count of <200 cells/µl compared with that for seronegative subjects. In conclusion, this novel HPV study, carried out in Northern Taiwan on men who have sex with men, revealed that age and immune state were associated significantly and independently with HPV infection."

The present study describes the HPV prevalence in urine samples of 243 HIV-infected men and a control group of 231 men. HPV DNA was amplified by the SPF10 polymerase chain reaction primer set. The overall HPV prevalence in HIV-infected men was 27.5% compared with 12.6% in controls (P < 0.01). Infections with high-risk and multiple HPV genotypes were present in both groups. Differences were not statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model showed a decreased HPV prevalence associated with use of a nucleoside and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination (P = 0.03). A trend was observed towards a higher HPV prevalence and a lower CD4 cell count. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the role of HPV DNA testing in urine in future screening programmes for anal cancer in men."
5786,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
733,0.001,1.0000,"beta 2-Microglobulin and lysozyme were determined in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 137 patients, using immunofluorometry and ELISA, respectively. Of these patients, 54 were infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) (including 20 AIDS dementia patients), 73 were HIV1-seronegative with neurological diseases (meningitis (n = 10), multiple sclerosis (n = 29), other neurological diseases (n = 34)) and 10 were controls. Intrathecal synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin occurred in each group. Conversely, lysozyme intrathecal synthesis was found only in meningitis (10/10) and in HIV1-infection (24/54). A pathological increase in beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis (> or = 2 mg/l) was observed in 45 patients (34 HIV1-infected patients and 11 HIV1-seronegative patients with neurological diseases). Serum concentration and intrathecal synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin were correlated only in the 20 AIDS dementia patients. The cerebrospinal fluid beta 2-microglobulin and lysozyme concentrations were correlated in the 54 HIV1-infected patients only. Blood CD4 + T-cell count was correlated negatively with beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis but not with lysozyme intrathecal synthesis. These data suggest that in the absence of any central nervous system opportunistic process the increase of beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis (> or = 2 mg/l) may be a reliable marker of central nervous system involvement in HIV1-infected patients. Intrathecal synthesis of lysozyme was related principally to HIV1-encephalitis and central nervous system opportunistic processes."

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naïve HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/µL; IQR: 255-511 cells/µL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR."
5323,0.001,1.0000,"In epidemiologic studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus compared with women with similar treatment histories. We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

7926,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects target cells by binding to CD4 and a chemokine receptor, most commonly CCR5. CXCR4 is a frequent alternative coreceptor (CoR) in subtype B and D HIV-1 infection, but the importance of many other alternative CoRs remains elusive. We have analyzed HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins from 66 individuals infected with the major subtypes of HIV-1 to determine if virus entry into highly permissive NP-2 cell lines expressing most known alternative CoRs differed by HIV-1 subtype. We also performed linear regression analysis to determine if virus entry via the major CoR CCR5 correlated with use of any alternative CoR and if this correlation differed by subtype. Virus pseudotyped with subtype B Env showed robust entry via CCR3 that was highly correlated with CCR5 entry efficiency. By contrast, viruses pseudotyped with subtype A and C Env proteins were able to use the recently described alternative CoR FPRL1 more efficiently than CCR3, and use of FPRL1 was correlated with CCR5 entry. Subtype D Env was unable to use either CCR3 or FPRL1 efficiently, a unique pattern of alternative CoR use. These results suggest that each subtype of circulating HIV-1 may be subject to somewhat different selective pressures for Env-mediated entry into target cells and suggest that CCR3 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtype B while FPRL1 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtypes A and C. These data may provide insight into development of resistance to CCR5-targeted entry inhibitors and alternative entry pathways for each HIV-1 subtype."
3875,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-resistant commercial sex workers provide a unique opportunity to study correlates of protection associated with natural resistance to HIV infection. Emerging data from studies of these individuals and other uninfected individuals who have been exposed to HIV suggest that low levels of immune activation may contribute to protection against infection. In the present study, HIV-resistant individuals were shown to have reduced frequencies of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69. They were also found to have elevated frequencies of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, compared with HIV-negative control individuals. By controlling levels of T cell activation, T(reg) cells may contribute to HIV resistance by minimizing the pool of cells susceptible to infection."
7432,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus share common routes of transmission, and hence, coinfection with these two viruses is common. Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."
5223,0.001,1.0000,Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection for whom prior treatment of HCV with interferon-ribavirin has failed may require subsequent treatment with new HCV protease inhibitors (PIs). We evaluated the diversity of HCV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) in 26 HCV- and HIV-coinfected patients receiving stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) who were treated with interferon-ribavirin. Plasma HCV RNA clonal analysis was performed. There was greater baseline NS3 diversity in patients with nonresponse or relapse than in those with sustained virologic response. Interferon-ribavirin treatment did not result in significant changes in HCV protease gene diversity or significant HCV PI resistance mutations. The effect of prior interferon-ribavirin treatment on HCV NS3 will likely not impact HCV PI efficacy in HIV-coinfected patients receiving ART.
5392,0.001,1.0000,"A prospective cohort study was conducted in two villages in Zambia to compare the efficacy of praziquantel in the treatment of schistosomiasis haematobium in people with and without concomitant infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Five hundred seven individuals with infected with Schistosoma haematobium were enrolled and followed-up for as long as 12 months after treatment with a single dose of praziquantel. Seventy-three were coinfected with HIV. The study demonstrated that praziquantel is still very effective in the treatment and control of S. haematobium even when there is coinfection with HIV (without symptoms and signs of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]/HIV disease). Resistance to reinfection with S. haematobium is not altered in subjects coinfected with HIV (without symptoms and signs of AIDS/HIV disease). Individuals with coinfection excreted fewer eggs and complained less of hematuria than those without HIV infection, and the sensitivity and positive predictive value of reported hematuria as an indication of heavy infection were lower in the group coinfected with HIV. This observation may have implications for the use of hematuria as an indicator for rapid diagnosis of schistosomiasis in areas where HIV is prevalent."
1189,0.001,1.0000,"Depression affects 18-30 % of HIV-infected patients in Africa and is associated with greater stigma, lower antiretroviral adherence, and faster disease progression. However, the region's health system capacity to effectively identify and treat depression is limited. Task-shifting models may help address this large mental health treatment gap. Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is a task-shifting model in which a Depression Care Manager guides a non-psychiatric (e.g., HIV) provider in prescribing and managing antidepressant treatment. We adapted MBC for depressed HIV-infected patients in Cameroon and completed a pilot study to assess feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. We enrolled 55 participants; all started amitriptyline 25-50 mg daily at baseline. By 12 weeks, most remained at 50 mg daily (range 25-125 mg). Median (interquartile range) PHQ-9 depressive severity scores declined from 13 (12-16) (baseline) to 2 (0-3) (week 12); 87 % achieved depression remission (PHQ-9 <5) by 12 weeks. Intervention fidelity was high: HIV providers followed MBC recommendations at 96 % of encounters. Most divergences reflected a failure to increase dose when indicated. No serious and few bothersome side effects were reported. Most suicidality (prevalence 62 % at baseline; 8 % at 12 weeks) was either passive or low-risk. Participant satisfaction was high (100 %), and most participants (89 %) indicated willingness to pay for medications if MBC were implemented in routine care. The adapted MBC intervention demonstrated high feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in this uncontrolled pilot study. Further research should assess whether MBC could improve adherence and HIV outcomes in this setting. "
1289,0.001,1.0000,"Anti-hepatitis Be (HBe) carriers are perceived as having low infectivity, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels far below those seen in the HBeAg carrier. However, the temporal stability of HBV DNA in anti-HBe carriers remains poorly characterised. UK Department of Health guidelines use HBV DNA levels to define whether HBV-infected health care workers may perform exposure-prone procedures. Two samples separated by 1-23 years available from 147 carriers were analysed for precore variants and HBV DNA levels. Among 15 HBeAg carriers, HBV DNA was maintained at high levels. There was a 5 log(10) fold reduction in DNA in 11 individuals who developed anti-HBe during follow-up evaluation. Proportional changes in HBV DNA levels in anti-HBe carriers were similar to those in HBeAg carriers, although there was a trend for changes in viral DNA to be more marked in anti-HBe carriers followed up for longer periods. Closer sampling in 20 anti-HBe carriers demonstrated large fluctuations of DNA levels over short periods. Serum transaminases and precore mutant status at the outset failed to predict those in whom HBV DNA levels fluctuated. HBV DNA was below the detection threshold (<400 copies/ml) in 36 anti-HBe carriers at first sampling and remained so in all but 5 of these carriers. Twelve individuals who were previously viraemic lost detectable HBV DNA during follow-up evaluation. While HBV DNA levels are found to fluctuate in carriers, our results indicate that once below the threshold of detectability, levels are unlikely to rise. This is an important factor when assessing health care workers for exposure-prone procedures."
1696,0.001,1.0000,"The widespread screening of donors of blood, organs and semen for HIV antibody has contributed greatly to the prevention of spread of HIV to patients in British hospitals. The chances of patients acquiring HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion are now estimated at less than 1 in 1 million and factor VIII for haemophiliacs, which is also heat treated, is now virtually always free of HIV contamination. However, the wider use of HIV antibody tests to identify infected patients and rationalize the application of additional 'inoculation risk' precautions, so as to protect staff, is controversial. The risks of hospital staff acquiring HIV following occupational exposure, without such a screening-programme, are extremely low provided a high standard of hygiene is maintained and inoculation injuries are avoided. When needlestick injuries occur, involving HIV infected patients, the chances of transmission of HIV to hospital staff are less than 1 in 100. Current guidelines in Britain depend on use of additional inoculation precautions for patients belonging to HIV risk groups but in practice most of these 'risk patients' are not infected with HIV. Screening HIV antibody tests, preferably with consent, can help the smooth running of operating theatres in areas where many 'risk patients' require surgery, as extra precautions are not necessary for most of these patients who are HIV negative. All antenatal patients should be screened especially in areas of high prevalence of HIV, as this helps to prevent vertical transmission as well as facilitating the rational use of extra precautions to protect health care workers."
4210,0.001,1.0000,"Orally administered nucleus(t)ide analogues (NA) have brought about a simple, safe and effective therapeutic approach for chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, treatment duration is long and some female patients become pregnant during treatment. In recent years, there have been gradually increasing reports on the safety of telbivudine (LdT) treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) of HBV; however, the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy and provide a reference for HBV-infected fertile women on how to block MTIT of HBV. Eighty-six pregnant women who received LdT treatment either before or in early pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were prospectively observed for the entire pregnancy and perinatal period, and short-term and long-term follow-up of infants was conducted, monitoring the abnormalities of infants and blocking rate of MTIT with LdT treatment. Eighty-six pregnant women treated with LdT had a total of 89 pregnancies: 6 (6.7%) had early embryonic death or spontaneous abortion, 1 (1.1%) had ectopic pregnancy and three had a second pregnancy after initial abortion. Fifty-one mothers completed pregnancy: one had induction of labour at 24 weeks of pregnancy for cleft lip and palate of the foetus and 50 delivered 52 full-term live infants. One infant had right ear accessories, and the total occurrence of congenital abnormality was 3.8%. Thirty-nine infants were followed up for more than 6 months and completed all examinations for MTIT. None of the infants were HBsAg positive, resulting in a 100% success rate of blocking MTIT. All mothers maintained good liver function during the third trimester of pregnancy; 86% maintained complete virological response (HBV DNA <500 copies/mL) prior to delivery, and none developed progression of liver disease. Factors leading to increased adverse effects and drug resistance were not found. LdT treatment is safe and effective in chronic HBV-infected pregnant mothers for the entire pregnancy."
3027,0.001,1.0000,"Famciclovir is a novel guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against herpes viruses and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Several preliminary reports have described efficacy of famciclovir in patients with recurrent hepatitis B after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). This report describes the largest study to date of long-term famciclovir treatment in patients with de novo or recurrent hepatitis B post-OLT. One hundred thirty patients with detectable serum HBV DNA after OLT received oral famciclovir 500 mg tid on a compassionate-use basis. Safety analyses included all treated patients; efficacy was assessed in all patients and a subgroup of 73 patients with complete baseline HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) data who had received > or =6 months of treatment. Efficacy parameters included serum levels of HBV DNA, ALT, and anti-HBe or anti-HBs seroconversion rates. Of the 70 patients treated for > or =6 months who could be evaluated for response/non-response to famciclovir, 52 (74%) were responders, defined as patients who experienced a 70% decrease or more in HBV DNA levels from baseline, or who became HBV DNA-negative, for at least two consecutive visits. In famciclovir responders, HBV DNA levels decreased by a median of 91% after 12 weeks of treatment, 95% after 6 months and >99% after 18 months of treatment. Marked differentiation between responders and non-responders could be made soon after the onset of treatment. Among anti-HBe positive patients with evidence of HBV replication, 12/13 were responders. Patients with high baseline ALT levels experienced more rapid suppression of HBV DNA during therapy with famciclovir. Famciclovir therapy was safe and well tolerated; serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Famciclovir treatment may be beneficial in patients with hepatitis B infection post-OLT."
2138,0.001,1.0000,"Patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are a special group with growing interest. In order to study the epidemiological data of HIV+ patients on RRT in Spain, we collected individual information from 2004-2011 (period of use of highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] in the Autonomous Communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Catalonia, Valencia, Castilla la Mancha, Castilla León, Galicia, Madrid, La Rioja and the Basque Country, comprising 85% of the Spanish population. A total of 271 incident and 209 prevalent patients were analysed. They were compared with the remaining patients on RRT during the same period. The annual incidence was 0.8 patients per one million inhabitants, with a significant increase during the follow-up period. The proportion of prevalent HIV+ patients was 5.1 per 1,000 patients on RRT (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-5.8. Although glomerular diseases constituted the majority of cases (42%), diabetic nephropathy was the cause in 14% of patients. The nation-wide totals for these percentages were 13 and 25%, respectively. Compared to the total of patients in treatment, the risk of death was significantly higher in the HIV+ group: hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for age, sex and diabetes was 2.26 (95% CI 1.74 - 2.91). Hepatitis C coinfection increased the risk of death in the HIV+ group (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.10 - 2.85). The probability of kidney transplantation in HIV+ was only 17% after 7 years, comparing with total RTT patients (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10-0.24). Despite the use of HAART, the incidence of HIV+ patients on dialysis has increased; their mortality still exceeds non-HIV patients, and they have a very low rate of transplantation. It is necessary to further our knowledge of this disease in order to improve results. "
9914,0.001,1.0000,"The effects of cystamine on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) expression in cord blood monocytes-derived macrophages (CBMDM) and lymphocytes were investigated. Cystamine suppressed HIV-1 expression in CBMDM and lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent fashion as determined by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. This inhibitory effect of cystamine occurred with all five HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adopted and fresh isolates) tested in the study. The addition of cystamine to cultures of HIV-1 chronically infected CBMDM also suppressed 80% to 90% of RT activity in comparison with untreated controls. Cystamine also decreased HIV-1 protein expression in CBMDM as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The inhibitory effects of cystamine on HIV-1 did not appear to be caused by toxicity to CBMDM or lymphocytes because there was no change in cell viability or cellular DNA synthesis as evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and [3H]-thymidine incorporation at doses of cystamine that inhibit the virus. HIV-1 infected CBMDM or lymphocyte cultures (without cystamine treatment) demonstrated giant syncytium formation or cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, whereas cystamine-treated cultures lacked the giant syncytia or CPE induced by HIV-1 infection. Thus, these observations indicate that cystamine may have the potential to limit HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in vivo and may represent a potentially useful compound in the treatment of pediatric HIV-1 infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."
6408,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) shows resistance to 3'azido-3'deoxythymidine (AZT) after one or two years of treatment. AZT also has significant toxic side effects, further limiting its use in the therapy of HIV-1-infected individuals. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been shown to have a broad spectrum of biological functions, to be bioavailable orally and to be relatively nontoxic. Epidemiological studies provide evidence that reduced serum levels of DHEA are related to the progression of AIDS in HIV-1 infection. DHEA has also been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro and block HIV-1 reactivation from chronically infected cell lines. However, there have been no reports on the ability of DHEA to inhibit the replication of AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. We investigated whether DHEA treatment could inhibit replication of AZT-resistant strains of HIV-1. Addition of DHEA to MT-2 cell cultures infected with either AZT-sensitive or AZT-resistant isolates of HIV-1 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1-induced cytopathic effect and suppression of HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity. At a concentration as low as 50 microM, DHEA reduced AZT-resistant HIV-1 replication over 50 percent as measured by cytopathic effect and accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity. This study provides evidence that DHEA can inhibit the replication of AZT-resistant as well as wild-type HIV-1. Since the main targets for DHEA are metabolic and cellular signaling pathways leading to HIV-1 replication-activation, DHEA should be effective against multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1. Combined with recently discovered immunoregulatory properties, the finding that DHEA is able to inhibit replication of both wild-type and AZT-resistant HIV-1 suggests that in vivo DHEA may have a much broader spectrum of action than originally anticipated."
2651,0.001,1.0000,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus are predisposed to develop a variety of common and uncommon infectious and neoplastic pulmonary diseases. Clinical information that can stratify the risk of occurrence of these pulmonary conditions includes: 1) CD4 cell count-the most important determinant; 2) concurrent antimicrobial therapy; 3) prior travel history; 4) known latent infections that may reactivate: and 5) underlying respiratory disease. Specific pulmonary diseases are discussed including: bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, mycobacterial and fungal infections, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and lung cancer. A differential diagnosis can be generated based on the chest radiographic pattern. Focal or multifocal areas of consolidation usually represent conventional bacterial pneumonia or, less commonly, tuberculosis. In severely immunocompromised patients, unusual diseases causing consolidation should be considered including: Rhodococcus infection, nocardiosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and lymphoma. Nodules can be present in tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Kaposi sarcoma. Interstitial opacities are common in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, histoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Cavitation and cysts are features of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis, aspergillosis, and lung cancer. Disease of the airways is increasingly recognized in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Lymphadenopathy is most common in mycobacterial infection, but can be a feature of fungal infection, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and lung cancer. The combined use of clinical information, knowledge of typical conditions associated with the human immunodeficiency syndrome, and radiographic patterns offers a useful approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary disease in the patient with the human immunodeficiency virus."

High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."
4543,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into cells is mediated by the surface-exposed envelope protein (SU) gp120, which binds to cellular CD4 and chemokine receptors, triggering the membrane fusion activity of the transmembrane (TM) protein gp41. The core of gp41 comprises an N-terminal triple-stranded coiled coil and an antiparallel C-terminal helical segment which is packed against the exterior of the coiled coil and is thought to correspond to a fusion-activated conformation. The available gp41 crystal structures lack the conserved disulfide-bonded loop region which, in human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and murine leukemia virus TM proteins, mediates a chain reversal, connecting the antiparallel N- and C-terminal regions. Mutations in the HTLV-1 TM protein gp21 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region adversely affected fusion activity without abolishing SU-TM association (A. L. Maerz, R. J. Center, B. E. Kemp, B. Kobe, and P. Poumbourios, J. Virol. 74:6614-6621, 2000). We now report that in contrast to our findings with HTLV-1, conservative substitutions in the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region abolished association with gp120. While the mutations affecting gp120-gp41 association also affected cell-cell fusion activity, HIV-1 glycoprotein maturation appeared normal. The mutant glycoproteins were processed, expressed at the cell surface, and efficiently immunoprecipitated by conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. The gp120 association site includes aromatic and hydrophobic residues on either side of the gp41 disulfide-bonded loop and a basic residue within the loop. The HIV-1 gp41 disulfide-bonded loop/chain reversal region is a critical gp120 contact site; therefore, it is also likely to play a central role in fusion activation by linking CD4 plus chemokine receptor-induced conformational changes in gp120 to gp41 fusogenicity. These gp120 contact residues are present in diverse primate lentiviruses, suggesting conservation of function."
9392,0.001,1.0000,"Isolated reactivity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) core antigen (anti-HBc) is observed relatively frequently in immunocompromised individuals, intravenous drug abusers (IVDA), and in the presence of HCV infection. The reason for the lack of HBsAg is not clear. The aim of the present study was to investigate which factors (genetic variability of S gene, low-level HBsAg, and immune complexes may be responsible for the failure of HBsAg detection with commercial HBsAg screening assays. Dilution series of two recombinant HBsAg escape mutants and dilutions of serum samples from chronic HBV carriers with multiple insertions in the a determinant and different HBsAg subtypes were tested with a highly sensitive assay that detects wild-type HBsAg (Elecsys HBsAg, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) and two assays that detect HBV wild-type and escape mutants (Murex HBsAg Version 3, Murex and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany). Elecsys HBsAg showed in comparison to Murex HBsAg Version 3 and Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0 a reduced sensitivity for escape mutant detection. On the other hand, the best performance for HBsAg subtype detection was obtained with Elecsys HBsAg. In the second part of the study, a selected panel of isolated anti-HBc reactive (n = 104) serum samples (AxSYM Core) was submitted to testing by Elecsys HBsAg, Murex HBsAg Version 3, Enzygnost HBsAg 5.0, and HBsAg detection after immune complex dissociation (ICD) and anti-HBs determination with two different assays (AxSYM Ausab and Elecsys Anti-HBs). To assess the specificity of anti-HBc test results, all the samples were tested by a second anti-HBc assay (Elecsys Anti-HBc). Quantitative HBV DNA detection was undertaken with a commercially available HBV PCR assay (Amplicor HBV Monitor). HCV infection was present in 65.4% of anti-HBc only reactive individuals. Five AxSYM Core positive samples were negative by Elecsys Anti-HBc. Overall, 15 (14.4%) AxSYM Ausab negative samples gave positive results with Elecsys Anti-HBs (median value: 21 IU/ml). No low-level HBsAg carrier was detected among the isolated anti-HBc reactive individuals with Elecsys HBsAg. There was no evidence for the presence of immune complexes. Only one sample was repeatedly reactive by the Murex HBsAg, suggesting that the a mutant form of HBsAg was responsible for the isolated anti-HBc reactivity, however neutralisation assay was not interpretable and HBV DNA PCR was negative. Fifteen (14.4%) anti-HBc only positive individuals were HBV DNA carriers with concentrations ranging from 800 to more than >4,000,000 copies of viral DNA/ml. In conclusion, the most probable explanations for isolated anti-HBc reactivity in our study group are a possible interference of HBsAg synthesis by HCV infection (65.4%) and divergence of results of anti-HBs assays (14.4%). There is no evidence for the presence of low-level HBsAg carriers and immune complexes. HBsAg mutants cannot be excluded definitively by the test strategy used in the present evaluation."

6620,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBV Pol) is an important target for anti-HBV drug development; however, its low solubility and stability in vitro has hindered detailed structural studies. Certain nucleotide reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTIs) such as tenofovir and lamivudine can inhibit both HBV Pol and Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) RT, leading to speculation on structural and mechanistic analogies between the deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP)-binding sites of these enzymes. The Q151M mutation in HIV-1 RT, located at the dNTP-binding site, confers resistance to various NRTIs, while maintaining sensitivity to tenofovir and lamivudine. The residue corresponding to Gln151 is strictly conserved as a methionine in HBV Pol. Therefore, the structure of the dNTP-binding pocket of the HIV-1 RT Q151M mutant may reflect that of HBV Pol. Here, the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M, determined at 2.6 Å resolution, in a new crystal form with space group P321 is presented. Although the structure of HIV-1 RT Q151M superimposes well onto that of HIV-1 RT in a closed conformation, a slight movement of the β-strands (β2-β3) that partially create the dNTP-binding pocket was observed. This movement might be caused by the introduction of the bulky thioether group of Met151. The structure also highlighted the possibility that the hydrogen-bonding network among amino acids and NRTIs is rearranged by the Q151M mutation, leading to a difference in the affinity of NRTIs for HIV-1 RT and HBV Pol."
5204,0.001,1.0000,"To elucidate the prevalence and clinical implications of infection with the newly described TT virus (TTV) among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in Yunnan, southwest China, serum samples from 158 IVDUs (129 M, 29 F; mean age 26.1 +/- 5.5 years) were examined for TTV DNA by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers derived from the open reading frame (ORFI) of TTV DNA. The seroprevalence of viral markers of HIV, HBV, HCV and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C) infection was also examined. A molecular evolutionary analysis was performed. Thirty one (20%) of the IVDUs were positive for TTV DNA, and 34 (22%), 6 (4%), 98 (62%), 76 (48%), 136 (86%) and 65 (41%) were positive for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and GBV-C RNA, respectively. When all the subjects were classified according to TTV DNA positivity, no significant differences were observed in demographic, biochemical or virological characteristics between the 2 groups. TTV infection was in all cases associated with co-infection with 1 or more of the other aforementioned viruses. There were no significant differences in the various combinations of co-infection between TTV positive and negative groups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the TTV isolates obtained in the study could be grouped mainly into TTV genotype 1, and that some of the isolates belonged to subgroups other than those previously described. These results indicate that: 1) TTV infection is prevalent among IVDUs in China; 2) TTV probably has minor liver pathogenicity; and 3) new subgroups of genotype 1 and 2 exist in China."
2407,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical significance of persistent residual viremia in patients on prolonged highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is not clear. Moreover, it remains to be demonstrated whether residual viremia consists of viruses capable of spreading infection in vivo upon termination of therapy. Using residual viral RNAs (vRNAs) isolated from a HAART-treated patient's plasma, we cloned full-length viral genomes and found that most of them could produce infectious, replication-competent HIVs when transfected into TZM-bl cells, suggesting that residual viruses produced in the absence of therapy can initiate fresh cycles of infection and spread in host cells. The data further indicate that residual viremia may pose a major concern with regard to the emergence of drug-resistant HIVs during periods of low adherence to therapy."
6508,0.001,1.0000,"Multiple nucleoside resistance involves specific genetic changes in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene, such as Q151M mutation and an insertion of two serine aminoacids at RT codon 69. Among 432 patients failing antiretroviral therapy, five (1.15%) harboured viruses with Q151M mutation into the RT gene and no viruses were identified harbouring insertion at codon 69. Also we have studied the long-term benefit of HIV genotypic testing with the failure to reach a viral load below 50 copies/ml within 1 year of antiretroviral therapy using as the primary end-point. A group of 64 HIV-positive antiretroviral multiexperienced patients were examined, all of them failing the current ART. HIV-RNA changed -0.8 log at month 4 and +0.1 log and -0.5 log at months 8 and 12, respectively. The proportion of patients with viral load below 50 copies/ml was 19.3, 32.8, and 28.1% at months 4, 8, and 12, respectively. In multidrug-experienced patients, genotype-guided therapy is not in fact able to achieve complete viral suppression in more than 30% of patients after 1 year of ART. The development of more precise resistance tests and interpretations are needed for better control of HIV replication. Other metabolic/pharmacokinetics factors of poor drug adherence should also be assessed."
4550,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1-associated dementia (HIV-D) remains a significant consequence of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. Since the clinical introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of HIV-D has decreased, yet the prevalence has increased as patients are living longer under treatment. Additionally, a less severe form of HIV-D, minor cognitive motor disorder, has become an increasing issue. Two different models have been proposed for virus entry in the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV-D. In the 'Trojan horse' model, the virus enters the CNS early carried by macrophages and infects resident glia; later in the course of infection, virus replication is activated and additional monocyte/macrophages are recruited into the CNS via cytokine/chemokine networks and endothelial-cell-leukocyte interactions at the blood-brain barrier. In the 'late invasion' model, an inherently invasive activated monocyte subset is expanded from bone marrow as a result of immune dysregulation in the periphery in the setting of AIDS. In this review we discuss these two separate, although not mutually exclusive, means for virus entry and persistence in the CNS. Additionally, we explore mechanisms for neuronal injury and apoptosis, including the role of virus, viral and host proteins, oxidative stress and products of infected or uninfected activated microglia and astrocytes. Potential therapeutic strategies are also briefly discussed."
438,0.001,1.0000,"Multiple mechanisms are used by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to interfere with host-cell immune effector functions. The 27-kD Nef protein has been shown to down-modulate specific genes of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on the surface of infected primary T cells, facilitating their escape from lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Macrophages, as the other major immune cell type targeted by the virus, also contribute to the transmission, persistence, and pathogenesis of HIV-1. Yet, whether Nef modulates MHC-I expression on HIV-infected primary macrophages remains unclear. Currently available infectious HIV-1 molecular clones, which express a reporter gene, only infect T cells and/or do not express Nef. To overcome these limitations, we generated macrophage-tropic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HIV-1 viruses, which express the complete viral genome, and used these to assess the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 on the surface of productively infected macrophages. The reporter viral genomes were replication-competent and stable, as Nef, p24 antigen, and GFP expression could be detected by immunostaining of infected, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after more than 2 months postinfection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of infected macrophages and T cells revealed that although wild-type reporter virus infection induced a statistically significant decrease in the density of surface HLA-A2, down-regulation of HLA-A2 was not seen in cells infected with reporter viruses encoding a frameshift or a single point mutation in Nef at prolines 74P and P80. The impact of Nef on HLA-A2 surface expression in MDM was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. These results suggest that the mechanisms of HLA-A2 down-modulation are similar in primary T cells and macrophages."
8686,0.001,1.0000,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."
4123,0.001,1.0000,"To examine the genetic relatedness of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) from different geographic locations, we molecularly cloned the genome of HIV isolated from a Zairian AIDS patient. Restriction mapping of the recombinant clone, designated HIV-Zr6, revealed both common (as observed in other HIV isolates) and unique restriction sites. The DNA clone of HIV-Zr6, shown to give rise to infectious cytopathic virus after transfection of cultured lymphoid cells, was sequenced in several regions. The long terminal repeat (LTR), open reading frame 1 (ORF1), C-terminal envelope (env) gene domain, and ORF2 showed less than 6% difference in nucleotide sequence when compared to other HIV isolates including human T-lymphotropic virus-type III (HTLV-III) clone B10, lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1), and AIDS-associated retrovirus-2 (ARV-2). About 15% difference in nucleotide sequences was noted in the N-terminal env gene domain. Alignments of env gene sequences revealed conserved, moderately variable, and hypervariable stretches in the predicted amino acid sequences. This model provides a basis for assessing the significance of sequence variation on properties controlled by the viral Env glycoproteins such as cell tropism and immunogenicity."
6613,0.001,1.0000,"The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and infectious diseases, however its role in HIV-1 infection is unknown. Here we show that HIV-1-infected patients present elevated plasma levels of MIF, that HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) release a greater amount of MIF, and that the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 induces MIF secretion from uninfected PBMCs. The HIV-1 replication in PBMCs declines when these cells are treated with anti-MIF antibodies, and exposure of HIV-1-infected cells to the ABC-transporter inhibitor probenecid results in inhibition of MIF secretion. The addition of recombinant MIF (rhMIF) to HIV-1-infected PBMCs enhances viral replication of CCR5- or CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Using a T CD4(+) cell lineage containing an HIV long terminal repeats (LTR)-Luciferase construct, we detected that rhMIF promotes transcription from HIV-1 LTR. Our results show that HIV-1 induces MIF secretion and suggest that MIF influences the HIV-1 biology through activation of HIV-1 LTR."
7708,0.001,1.0000,"Current understanding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription is based on unidirectional expression of transcripts with positive-strand polarity from the 5' long terminal repeat. We now report HIV-1 transcripts with negative-strand polarity obtained from acutely and chronically infected cell lines by use of a template orientation-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR assay. These findings were confirmed in natural infection by analysis of RNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 15 HIV-1-infected patients. A cDNA derived from a 2.3-kb polyadenylated HIV-1 RNA with negative-strand polarity which encodes a highly conserved 189-amino-acid open reading frame antiparallel to the envelope gene was isolated from acutely infected A3.01 cells. Through use of reporter gene constructions, we further found that a novel negative-strand promoter functions within the negative response element of the 3' long terminal repeat, which is downregulated by coexpression of Tat. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that NF-kappa B I and USF sites are crucial for negative-strand promoter activity. These data extend the coding capacity of HIV-1 and suggest a role for antisense regulation of the viral life cycle."
5869,0.001,1.0000,"We have observed that CD4+ T cell counts in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected patients treated with only Korean red ginseng (KRG) are maintained or even increased for a prolonged period. In the present study, we investigated whether the development of resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT) to zidovudine (ZDV) is delayed by combined therapy with KRG and ZDV. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing methods were used to define RT codons 41, 67, 70, 210, 215 and 219 of the HIV-1 pol gene in DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples from 18 patients. Nine of these eighteen patients were in the KRG group and had been treated with KRG for 60 +/- 15 months (range: 38-82) and ZDV, and nine were in the control group and had been treated with ZDV only. The patients in the KRG group had been treated with ZDV for 75 +/- 24 months, and CD4+ T cell counts were maintained from 239 +/- 85 to 234 +/- 187 microliters-1 (P > 0.05) during the study period, whereas the patients in the control group had been treated with ZDV for 51 +/- 31 months, and their CD4+ T cell counts decreased from 272 +/- 97 to 146 +/- 154 microliters-1 (P < 0.01). In samples within 24 months of ZDV therapy, the overall incidence of 6 resistance mutations to ZDV was 4.2% and 47% in the KRG and control group (P < 0.01), respectively. In samples after 24 months of therapy, the incidence was 21.7% and 56.3% in the KRG and control group (P < 0.01), respectively. These data suggest that the maintenance of CD4+ T cell counts by ZDV and KRG-intake for a prolonged period might be indirectly associated with delayed development of resistance to ZDV by KRG-intake."

In ongoing efforts to alleviate this crisis, the national government has placed great emphasis on efforts in Henan province where HIV-infected former plasma donors in the 1990s contributed to AIDS becoming a public health crisis. Concomitant with a national initiative focusing the use of pharmacogenetics for the better prediction of treatment response, we studied genetic variants with known pharmacokinetic phenotypes in a set of 298 HAART-treated (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients infected with HIV from the Henan cohort. We measured the association of response to treatment, assessed as changes in CD4+ T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy, of five polymorphisms in four genes (CYP2B6, ABCB1/MDR1, ABCG2, and ABCC4) in which variation has been suggested to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly employed to treat HIV/AIDS. We show that genotyping for ABCB1 variations (rs1045642 and rs2032582) may help predict HIV treatment response. We found variations in this gene have a significant association with outcome as measured by CD4+ T cell counts in a discovery subset (N= 197; odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95% CI 1.02-2.45), these results were confirmed in a validation subset of the cohort (N = 78; OR= 2.81; 95% CI 1.32-5.96). Exploratory analysis suggests that this effect may be specific to NVP (nevirapine) or 3TC (lamivudine) response. This publication represents the first genetic analysis in a continuing effort to study and assist the patients in a very large, unique, and historically significant HIV-AIDS cohort. Genotyping of AIDS patients for ABCB1 variation may help predict outcome and potentially could help guide treatment strategies."
6358,0.001,1.0000,"Contact tracing--or partner notification--is a generally accepted method for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but its use as an epidemiological tool against the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been questioned. The authors find contact tracing for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) quite feasible; it makes it possible for health care providers to reach people at high risk for infection in order to offer them counseling and testing. Contact tracing must be performed by someone directly engaged in caring for the HIV infected patient, as well as in giving support and aiding the patient through possible crisis reactions. Through this approach the authors were able to identify 188 contacts to 91 index patients. Thirty-eight of the contacts were seropositive for HIV infection, and 21 of these were previously unaware of their infection."
4980,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis virus B or C (HBV, HCV) transmission are major risks following infusion of coagulation factor concentrates. Thus, several methods have been used to achieve viral inactivation of concentrates prepared from plasma collected from a large number of donors. In this study, 32 patients with haemophilia A or B (n = 31) or von Willebrand's disease (n = 1) were treated between 1987 and 1990 only with factor VIII or IX concentrates inactivated by the solvent-detergent procedure. During this period, none of these cases exhibited elevated liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase), and serological tests for HIV, HBV and HCV infections always remained negative. This suggests that the solvent-detergent procedure of concentrate inactivation is an efficient method to prevent not only HIV or HBV transmission but also HCV infection in haemophiliacs."
2400,0.001,1.0000,"Two hundred two patients with hemophilia, dependent solely on imported coagulation factor concentrates, were tested for markers of hepatitis B virus infection, antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HD), and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). Nine carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were identified. Six (66.7%) of them were positive for anti-HD, a prevalence much higher than that in HBsAg carriers without hemophilia in Japan (1/113 or 0.9%, p less than 0.001). Anti-HIV was found in 96 (47.5%), in sharp contrast to the low prevalence (0/1205) in apparently healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001). These results implicated imported plasma products in the transmission of both delta and human immunodeficiency viruses to hemophiliacs. An efficient method for the sterilization of plasma products is warranted to prevent exposure of hemophiliacs to the accompanying pathogenic viruses."
2509,0.001,1.0000,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
4844,0.001,1.0000,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "

The anti-HCV was performed by third generation immunoenzymatic technique, and the HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C virus was 16% (CI: 12.4 - 19.6). Multivariate analysis showed association between virus C infection and age, with significant risk in the group about fifty years old or more (OR=9.75), blood transfusion (OR=4.74) and use of injecting drugs (OR=149.28). The hepatitis C virus infection was detected in 83.7% of intravenous drug users and 22.1% of transfused patients. These data indicate the efficient transmission of the virus through the percutaneous exposition and reaffirm the high risk to hepatitis C among injectable illicit drug user."

HIV vertical transmission occurred from 42 HCV-infected mothers (26.1%) versus 53 HCV-uninfected mothers (16.3%; odds radio [OR], 1.82; P = .01). In a logistic regression model that included maternal drug use, a potential confounder, HCV infection was marginally associated with perinatal HIV transmission (OR, 1.64; P = .05), whereas drug use was not. Women who transmitted HIV had higher levels of HCV RNA (median, 721,254 copies/mL) than those who did not (337,561 copies/mL; P = .01). Maternal HCV infection is associated with increased HIV vertical transmission. Further studies are needed to ascertain if HCV directly affects perinatal HIV transmission or is a marker for another factor, such as maternal drug use."

Individuals homozygous for the delta ccr5 allele resist primary macrophage-tropic HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk sexual exposures. This gene deletion is relatively common among Caucasians but uncommon among Africans, Asians, and South Americans. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to determine the frequency of the delta ccr5 allele in a Taiwanese population with diverse health status and social backgrounds. Subjects included 24 HIV-1-infected persons in the northern and southern parts of Taiwan; 131 HIV-1 high-risk, licensed female sex workers in the northern part of the island (21% of whom were aborigines); and 187 unrelated, healthy, HIV-1-negative individuals in southern Taiwan. PCR with primers encompassing the entire CCR5 gene was used to explore possible deletions at regions other than the 32-nucleotide area in the female sex workers. No ccr5 deletions were detected, indicating that they are rare or absent in the Taiwanese population. This finding implies that delta ccr5 is not likely to be part of the defense against the spread of HIV-1-infection in Taiwanese."
6081,0.001,1.0000,"One thousand eight hundred eighty-seven children born to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive mothers, including 1045 infants prospectively followed up from birth, were studied. Intravenous drug use was the most frequent maternal risk factor, although the percentage of women infected by sexual contact increased from 5.8% in 1985 to 28.5% in 1990. Of the 551 first children followed up from birth and older than 15 months of age, 101 (18.3%) acquired infection and seroconverted to HIV-1. Another 31 (5.6%) asymptomatic seronegative children showed the presence of viral markers, for an apparent mother-to-offspring transmission rate of 23.9%. Overlapping results were seen in 22 second-born children followed up from birth. Of 59 sibships with definite infection status, when the first child was infected, 14 (40%) of 35 second children were infected, whereas when the first child was not infected, only 2 of 24 (8.3%) second children were infected. Discordance in HIV-1 transmission was found in 1 of 18 pairs of twins. Univariate and multivariate analyses of possible risk factors for HIV-1 transmission performed on the entire population of children and in the cohort of those followed up from birth were basically in agreement in indicating that the development of symptoms in the mother before delivery and breast-feeding (indeed adopted in only 22 infants in whom HIV-1 infection was identified at birth) were significantly and independently associated with a higher transmission rate.

686,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to define the prevalence of human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 in patients who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. We evaluated 319 individuals infected with HIV type 1 who were attended at specialized clinics in two cities (Ribeirão Preto and São Paulo). The patients were interviewed and tested for antibodies against HTLV types 1 and 2 (Orthoâ HTLV-1/HTLV-2 Ab-Capture enzyme immunoassay). Direct DNA sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products from the tax region of HTLV type 2 and the long terminal repeat region of HTLV types 1 and 2 were performed to differentiate and determine the subtypes. The overall prevalence of anti-HTLV type 1 and 2 antibodies was 7.5% (24/319; 95% CI: 5.2-11.5). HTLV type 1 and 2 infection was associated with a history of injected drug use and with antibodies for hepatitis C virus (p < 0.001), but not with age (p = 0.2), sex (p = 0.9), sexual behavior or serological markers for sexually transmitted diseases (anti-Treponema pallidum, anti-human herpesvirus type 8 or anti-hepatitis B virus antibodies) (p > 0.05). HTLV DNA was detected in 13 out of 24 samples, of which 12 were characterized as HTLV subtype 2c and one as HTLV subtype 1a. Among the 12 HTLV type 2 samples, seven were from injected drug users, thus indicating that this route is an important risk factor for HTLV type 2 transmission among our population infected with HIV type 1."

To search for possible sources of HIV in saliva, and using the polymerase chain-reaction technique, we sought the presence and shedding patterns of proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid in a group of patients previously determined as HIV-1-seropositive. Periodontal status at the collection sites was monitored by several clinical parameters, including Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing depth, and clinical attachment loss. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected by means of paper points. Proviral HIV-1 DNA was detected in the gingival fluid of 17 out of 35 HIV-1-infected patients. Its detection correlated significantly with higher plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.03) and not with peripheral blood CD4+ cell count, the presence of blood in gingival fluid, or oral lesions. There was a significant correlation between clinical attachment loss at the sites of fluid collection and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.002), and borderline correlation between the latter and probing depth (p = 0.54) in the group of patients harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid. The results of our study suggest that mononuclear cells present in gingival crevicular fluid and harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA could represent a potential source of HIV-1 in the presence or absence of local bleeding, especially in persons with advanced HIV infection and increased loss of clinical attachment."
4528,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes infectious hepatitis worldwide. It is transmitted mainly by blood products and sharing of intravenous paraphernalia during illicit drug use. High prevalence rates have been described among specific groups considered to be at higher risk for HCV infection, including prison inmates. The objectives of this study were: to determine the HCV seroprevalence among inmates of Casa de Detenção de São Paulo; to identify risk factors for HCV infection; and to compare the seroprevalence of HCV to other blood borne or sexually transmitted diseases. From December, 1993, to January, 1994, a total of 779 inmates were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographic status, sexual behavior, and past experience with illicit drugs. Blood samples were obtained from 756 inmates for serological tests. 310 (41%) blood samples were positive for anti-HCV, 425 (56.2%) were negative, and 21 (2.8%) showed indeterminate results. In this population, we found a seroprevalence of 13.7% for HIV, 3.3% for syphilis (VDRL), and 68.1% for hepatitis B virus previous infection. Four variables were each identified as associated with a positive anti-HCV serologic test: a positive VDRL (OR = 2.63 IC 95% 1.08 to 6.36); a time of current imprisonment longer than 130 months (OR = 2.44 IC 95% 1.04 to 5.71); previous incarceration at Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.73 IC 95% 1.19 to 2.52) and; illicit drug use before admission to the Casa de Detenção de São Paulo (OR = 1.64 IC 95% 1.15 to 2.33). The seroprevalence of HCV antibodies among the study population was high (41%), indeed, one of the highest clusters of HCV infection recorded until now. Four variables were each shown to be associated with HCV infection. The simultaneous presence of these 4 variables is associated with an 82% probability of being anti-HCV positive. Although risk factor analysis indicates most HCV infections occur prior to inprisonment, initiation of control measures to prevent continued transmission after incarceration should be done."
285,0.001,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) are considered as key players in the global health scene. This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65 years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P < 0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ages below 30 years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30 years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."
2940,0.001,1.0000,"Objective To assess the implementation of HIV-related interventions for patients with tuberculosis (TB), as well as TB treatment outcomes in patients coinfected with HIV in Brazil in 2011. Methods This was a cross-sectional, operational research study of HIV-related interventions among TB cases and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV coinfected patients. It also used a retrospective cohort design to determine the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and favorable TB treatment outcomes. The source of data was a linkage of 2011 administrative health databases used by the National TB and HIV/AIDS Programs. Results Of 73 741 new cases of TB reported, 63.6% (46 865 patients) were tested for HIV; 10.3% were positive. Of patients with HIV, 45.9% or 3 502 were on ART. TB favorable outcome was achieved in 63.1% or 2 205 coinfected patients on ART and in only 35.4% or 1 459 of those not on ART. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for the association between ART and TB treatment success was 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.64-1.81). Conclusions The linkage between national TB and HIV datasets has created a convenient baseline for ongoing monitoring of HIV testing, ART use, and TB treatment outcomes among coinfected patients. The low rates of HIV screening and ART use in 2011 need to be improved. The association between ART and treatment success adds to the evidence supporting timely initiation of ART for all patients with TB-HIV coinfection."
114,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cells play a key role both in the control of HBV replication and in the pathogenesis of liver disease. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coinfection and the presence or absence of HBV e (precore) antigen (HBeAg) significantly alter the natural history of chronic HBV infection. We examined the HBV-specific T-cell responses in treatment-naïve HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative HIV-1-HBV-coinfected (n = 24) and HBV-monoinfected (n = 39) Asian patients. Peripheral blood was stimulated with an overlapping peptide library for the whole HBV genome, and tumor necrosis factor alpha and gamma interferon cytokine expression in CD8+ T cells was measured by intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry. There was no difference in the overall magnitude of the HBV-specific T-cell responses, but the quality of the response was significantly impaired in HIV-1-HBV-coinfected patients compared with monoinfected patients. In coinfected patients, HBV-specific T cells rarely produced more than one cytokine and responded to fewer HBV proteins than in monoinfected patients. Overall, the frequency and quality of the HBV-specific T-cell responses increased with a higher CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.018 and 0.032, respectively). There was no relationship between circulating HBV-specific T cells and liver damage as measured by activity and fibrosis scores, and the HBV-specific T-cell responses were not significantly different in patients with either HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative disease. The quality of the HBV-specific T-cell response is impaired in the setting of HIV-1-HBV coinfection and is related to the CD4+ T-cell count."
2791,0.001,1.0000,"Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection often develop complications related directly to the infection, as well as to treatment. Aging, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. HIV-associated neurologic complications encompass a wide spectrum of pathophysiology and symptomatology. Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions are common among persons with HIV infection. Although some specific antiretroviral medications have been linked to disease development, traditional risk factors (e.g., smoking) have major roles. Prevention and management of viral hepatitis coinfection are important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and new anti-hepatitis C agents produce high rates of sustained virologic response. Antiretroviral-associated metabolic complications include dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and loss of bone mineral density. Newer options generally pose less risk of significant systemic toxicity and are better tolerated. Family physicians who care for patients with HIV infection have a key role in identifying and managing many of these chronic complications."
3948,0.001,1.0000,"Within the past 18 months, we have seen four cases of neurosyphilis at our institution (two of meningovascular syphilis, one of acute syphilitic meningitis, and one of asymptomatic neurosyphilis) in young homosexual men with serologic evidence of exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two of the four patients had neurosyphilis despite previous adequate therapy for early syphilis with benzathine penicillin. Meningovascular syphilis developed in one patient within four months after a primary infection, in a manner consistent with an accelerated course of syphilitic infection. These findings suggest the possibility that HIV infection may alter the natural course of syphilis because of the profound defects in cell-mediated immunity it causes. The possible potentiating effects of HIV on Treponema pallidum infection suggest the need for lumbar puncture in the evaluation of HIV-seropositive patients with syphilis, as well as modifications of the currently recommended treatment regimens for primary, secondary, and latent syphilis and neurosyphilis in this patient population. Neurosyphilis should probably be added to the growing list of infectious complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and may be the first such complication to appear."
782,0.001,1.0000,"This study is the first prospective study to assess the prevalence, epidemiology, and risk factors of HIV-1 drug resistance in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients in Belgium. In January 2003 it was initiated as part of the pan-European SPREAD program, and continued thereafter for four inclusion rounds until December 2006. Epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and genotypic resistance testing was done on a sample taken within 6 months of diagnosis. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were included. The overall prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in Belgium was 9.5% (27/285, 95% CI: 6.6-13.4). Being infected in Belgium, which largely coincided with harboring a subtype B virus, was found to be significantly associated with transmission of drug resistance. The relatively high rate of baseline resistance might jeopardize the success of first line treatment as more than 1 out of 10 (30/285, 10.5%) viruses did not score as fully susceptible to one of the recommended first-line regimens, i.e., zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Our results support the implementation of genotypic resistance testing as a standard of care in all treatment-naive patients in Belgium."
4051,0.001,1.0000,"The determination of the prevalence of primary resistance to antiretroviral therapy in different places of the world is of extreme importance in molecular epidemiology monitoring, and it can guide the initial patient therapy in a given geographical area. The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."
9947,0.001,1.0000,"Ethiopia is one of the countries that are highly affected by dual epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB). HIV infection is a known risk factor for the development of active TB and it challenges in diagnosis and treatment of TB. Thus, it is essential to determine the epidemiology of HIV infection among TB patients to guide clinical actions and inform the policy makers. This study was aimed to assess the prevalence of HIV infection among TB patients and to describe the associated risk factors for HIV seropositivity."
5255,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 infection and compartmentalization in diverse leukocyte targets significantly contribute to viral persistence during suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Longitudinal analyses were performed on envelope sequences of HIV-1 populations from plasma, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 14 patients receiving HAART and 1 therapy-naive individual. Phylogenetic reconstructions and analysis of molecular variance revealed that HIV-1 populations in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained compartmentalized over time in most individuals. Analyses of viral genetic variation demonstrated that, despite compartmentalization remaining over time, viral subpopulations tended not to persist and evolve but instead broke down and became reconstituted by new founder viruses. Due to the profound impact of HAART on viral evolution, it was difficult to discern whether these dynamics were ongoing during treatment or predominantly established prior to the commencement of therapy. The genetic structure and viral founder effects observed in serially sampled T lymphocyte populations supported a scenario of metapopulation dynamics in the tissue(s) where different leukocytes become infected, a factor likely to contribute to the highly variable way that drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
6112,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to document the change in prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among sexually active minority teens at a primary and reproductive teen health clinic. Both new and current patients were sampled in a seroprevalence study in 1988 and again in 1992. None of the 1200 adolescents sampled were seropositive for HIV in 1988. Nine of the 1085 adolescents sampled were seropositive in 1992. Five of these 9 teens reported heterosexual contact only as a potential risk factor. Six of these 9 teens were not in school. These results suggest that HIV infection is increasing among Texas urban teens. Because current education programs do not appear to be preventing viral spread, new, focused intervention must be initiated for teenagers. In particular, an effective acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevention program for out-of-school youth is needed urgently."
1226,0.001,1.0000,"This report concerns three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in whom malignant melanoma developed. One patient had metastatic malignant melanoma, one had iris melanoma, and one had a single skin melanoma. All three had lower absolute numbers of CD4+ cells than a control group, and the severity of their disease was inversely proportional to the absolute number of CD4+ cells. This report suggests an association between the immunodeficiency resulting from HIV infection and the development of malignant melanoma."
1721,0.001,1.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinants have been found with high frequency, little is known about the forces that select for these viruses or their importance to pathogenesis. Here we document the emergence and dynamics of 11 distinct HIV-1 recombinants in a man who was infected with two subtype B HIV-1 strains and progressed rapidly to AIDS without developing substantial cellular or humoral immune responses. Although numerous frequency oscillations were observed, a single recombinant lineage eventually came to dominate the population. Numerical simulations indicate that the successive recombinant forms displaced each other too rapidly to be explained by any simple model of random genetic drift or sampling variation. All of the recombinants, including several resulting from independent recombination events, possessed the same sequence motif in the V3 loop, suggesting intense selection on this segment of the viral envelope protein. The outgrowth of the predominant V3 loop recombinants was not, however, associated with changes in coreceptor utilization. The final variant was instead notable for having lost 3 of 14 potential glycosylation sites. We also observed high ratios of synonymous-to-nonsynonymous nucleotide changes-suggestive of purifying selection-in all viral populations, with particularly high ratios in newly arising recombinants. Our study, therefore, illustrates the unusual and important patterns of viral adaptation that can occur in a patient with weak immune responses. Although it is hard to tease apart cause and effect in a single patient, the correlation with disease progression in this patient suggests that recombination between divergent viruses, with its ability to create chimeras with increased fitness, can accelerate progression to AIDS."
8130,0.001,1.0000,"Direct sequencing of segments of the envelope gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 proviruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has revealed that a cohort of hemophiliacs who were infected after exposure to a single common batch of factor VIII share closely related virus strains. Seventy-four sequences extending from hypervariable regions V4 through V5 from nine patients yielded a mean intrapatient nucleotide distance of 5.5%, while a mean of 4.2% was observed in 39 sequences of the V3 loop (six patients). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences of six Edinburgh patients were particularly closely related and those from a patient infected in the United States were very distinct. The mean nucleotide distance among these six was 8.3%, while the mean distance from the U.S.-derived sequences was 25.5% in the V4-V5 region. The rate of sequence change across this patient group has been estimated to be 0.4% per year in the V4-V5 region and 0.5% per year in the V3 region, with at least a twofold range across patients. Only two inactivating nucleotide substitutions have been observed in a total of 42 kb of sequence obtained from the env and gag genes during this study."
76,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between ancillary services, including case management, and clinical and behavioral outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women. Data were obtained from databases systematically maintained by Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) and the HIV Outpatient Program (HOP) in New Orleans. HIV-infected women receiving primary care from HOP and ancillary services from FACES between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 were eligible. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with STATA software. The majority of women included in the study were African American (86.7%), infected heterosexually (78.8%), and had absolute CD4 counts greater than 200 (58.6%). After adjusting for age, time, entry time into HOP, pregnancy, CD4 count, substance abuse status, and social and clinical stressors, receipt of more than four combined case manager contacts or ancillary services per month was significantly associated with being prescribed a protease inhibitor, improved adherence and retention in primary care, and enrolling on a research protocol. Receiving more than one transportation service per month was significantly associated with improved adherence, improved retention, one or more emergency room visits per month, and one or more hospitalizations per month. Receiving more than one contact with case managers per month was associated with improved retention in primary care. Findings suggest that receipt of case management and ancillary services is associated with improvements in multiple outcomes for HIV-infected women. A client-centered approach to providing ancillary services appears to be effective in improving behavioral and utilization characteristics in this population of low-income, high-risk women."
663,0.001,1.0000,"Disseminated adiaspiromycosis is a rare infection that is sometimes associated with immunocompromised situations. We report the case of a patient, infected with human immunodeficiency virus and receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, who had a liver transplant for hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient presented skin and pulmonary lesions due to adiaspiromycosis during immunosuppressive therapy. A review of >60 cases in the literature shows that adiaspiromycosis is a rare infection and Emmonsia is a dimorphic fungus that is difficult to grow. It should be considered a possible diagnosis in case of fungal infection and pulmonary granulomatosis. We should be aware of emerging adiaspiromycosis in patients with risk factors of immunosuppression, particularly transplant recipients. In these patients in particular, liposomal amphotericin B therapy should be considered."
15,0.001,1.0000,"The great variability of protein sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) isolates represents a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine against this virus. The surface protein (Env), which is the predominant target of neutralizing antibodies, is particularly variable. Here we examine the impact of variability among different HIV-1 subtypes (clades) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activities, the other major component of the antiviral immune response. CTLs are produced not only against Env but also against other structural proteins, as well as some regulatory proteins. The genetic subtypes of HIV-1 were determined for Env and Gag from several patients infected either in France or in Africa. The cross-reactivities of the CTLs were tested with target cells expressing selected proteins from HIV-1 isolates of clade A or B or from HIV type 2 isolates. All African patients were infected with viruses belonging to clade A for Env and for Gag, except for one patient who was infected with a clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. All patients infected in France were infected with clade B viruses. The CTL responses obtained from all the African and all the French individuals tested showed frequent cross-reactions with proteins of the heterologous clade. Epitopes conserved between the viruses of clades A and B appeared especially frequent in Gag p24, Gag p18, integrase, and the central region of Nef. Cross-reactivity also existed among Gag epitopes of clades A, B, and G, as shown by the results for the patient infected with the clade A Env-clade G Gag recombinant virus. These results show that CTLs raised against viral antigens from different clades are able to cross-react, emphasizing the possibility of obtaining cross-immunizations for this part of the immune response in vaccinated individuals."
6809,0.001,1.0000,"BK virus is ubiquitous worldwide, with infection usually occurring in early childhood. BK virus replicates prolifically under immunosuppressive conditions, causing inflammation along the genitourinary tract and progressing clinically to hemorrhagic cystitis, ureteral stenosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Most BK virusassociated nephropathy occurs in renal allograft patients after kidney transplantation, although some case reports have described BK virus-associated nephropathy in the native kidney, particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Here we present the case of a 49-year-old male with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and renal dysfunction with hydronephrosis. The renal biopsy showed tubulointerstitial nephritis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and intranuclear inclusions in the tubular epithelium, which are typical findings for BK virus-associated nephropathy. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed that the SV40 large T antigen exhibited a nuclear localization in tubular cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of BK virus-associated nephropathy combined with hydronephrosis that was diagnosed by biopsy in a patient with AIDS. "
8318,0.001,1.0000,"The relevance of CD4+T-cells, viral load and age in the immunological response to influenza infection and vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals has previously been pointed out. Our study aimed at assessing, in the setting of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination, whether quantification of activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression in blood B-cells may provide additional indications for predicting antibody response to vaccination in HIV-1 infected patients with similar CD4+T-cell counts and age. Forty-seven healthy controls, 37 ART-treated and 17 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months after vaccination. Antibody titers to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay while the mRNA expression levels of AID were measured by quantitative real time PCR. Upon B-cell activation in vitro, AID increase correlated to antibody response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 1 month after vaccination in all individuals. In addition, the maximum expression levels of AID were significantly higher in those individuals who still carried protective levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies after 6 months from vaccination. No correlation was found between CD4+T-cell counts or age at vaccination or HIV-1 viral load and levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Assessing AID expression before vaccination may be an additional useful tool for defining a vaccination strategy in immune-compromised individuals at risk of immunization failure."
348,0.001,1.0000,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
3643,0.001,1.0000,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
4984,0.001,1.0000,"Serology has been a fundamental tool to prevent post-transfusional infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and for epidemiological surveys, the first step to attempt control of the pandemia. Enzyme immunoassay is in widespread use. Nevertheless, simpler methods are needed in many countries, where laboratory facilities and trained personnel are limited, and HIV prevalence is high. The evaluation of a simple and noninstrumented HIV antibody test is presented here. The test employs synthetic antigens of HIV-1 and HIV-2 attached to the teeth of a polystyrene comb, which fit into the wells of standard microtiter plates where samples are diluted. Captured antibodies are developed with colloidal gold-labeled Protein A. Three seroconversion panels plus 662 samples were tested, including HIV-1 and HIV-2-infected individuals, normal blood donors, and a noninfected baby born to a seroreactive mother. When compared with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot, the dipstick showed 100% sensitivity and 98.7% specificity. The simplicity of result evaluations and excellent reagent stability make the dipstick suitable for small blood banks and for epidemiological surveys."
7657,0.001,1.0000,"Currently, conventional enzyme immunoassays which use manual gold immunoassays and colloidal tests (GICTs) are used as screening tools to detect Treponema pallidum (syphilis), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and HIV-2 in patients undergoing surgery. The present observational, cross-sectional study compared the sensitivity, specificity, and work flow characteristics of the conventional algorithm with manual GICTs with those of a newly proposed algorithm that uses the automated Bio-Flash technology as a screening tool in patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. A total of 956 patients were examined for the presence of serological markers of infection with HIV-1/2, HCV, HBV, and T. pallidum The proposed algorithm with the Bio-Flash technology was superior for the detection of all markers (100.0% sensitivity and specificity for detection of anti-HIV and anti-HCV antibodies, HBV surface antigen [HBsAg], and T. pallidum) compared with the conventional algorithm based on the manual method (80.0% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity for the detection of anti-HIV, 75.0% sensitivity for the detection of anti-HCV, 94.7% sensitivity for the detection of HBsAg, and 100% specificity for the detection of anti-HCV and HBsAg) in these patients. The automated Bio-Flash technology-based screening algorithm also reduced the operation time by 85.0% (205 min) per day, saving up to 24 h/week. In conclusion, the use of the newly proposed screening algorithm based on the automated Bio-Flash technology can provide an advantage over the use of conventional algorithms based on manual methods for screening for HIV, HBV, HCV, and syphilis before GI endoscopy."
5489,0.001,1.0000,"In West and West Central Africa, multiple subtypes, circulating recombinant forms (CRF), and high proportions of unique recombinant forms (URF) are documented. The predominance of recombinants strongly suggests that dual infections occur frequently. In the present study, we adapted the multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), previously developed to identify dual infections in geographic regions where few HIV-1 variants circulate, to identify HIV-1 variants and dual infections. We designed clade-specific probes in three genomic regions (gag p17, vpu, nef) to detect eight different variants that are common in this part of Africa (A, B/D, C, F, G, CRF02_AG, CRF06_cpx, CRF22_01A1). The assay was validated with 163 samples representing the corresponding HIV-1 variants. Depending on the genomic regions, the global sensitivity of the assay ranged from 86% to 94%, and the global specificity was between 85% and 96%. The assay was then applied on 156 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Cameroon. The MHA assay identified 79%, 85% and 90% of the strains in nef, gag and vpu regions, respectively. The subtype/CRF distribution and the proportion of inter-region recombinants obtained by the new MHA assay were in accordance with known subtype/CRF distribution in Cameroon. Moreover, the MHA assay identified 35 (22.4%) patients as dually infected, from which 20 were reactive in more than one region and/or with concordant multigenomic recombination pattern. Despite the high genetic diversity, we successfully developed an hybridization assay allowing identification of eight common HIV-1 variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. We documented high rates of dual infection in a low-risk population group, illustrating that the global evolution of HIV diversity is driven by dual infections. This assay could become a useful screening tool for the global surveillance and monitoring of inter-subtype/CRF dual infections in West and West Central Africa."
1947,0.001,1.0000,"The presence and antigen specificity of IgG and secretory-IgA (s-IgA) to HIV-1 were evaluated in cervicovaginal lavages (CVL) from 26 infected and 10 high-risk seronegative women. All the seropositive women had detectable IgG recognizing several viral antigens, while a smaller percentage of women demonstrated s-IgA to the virus. In addition, s-IgA were of limited specificity and provided weak reactivities on Immunoblot bands; an almost constant absence of s-IgA to gp120 was also observed. Neither the presence nor the specificity of either IgG or s-IgA to the virus in CVL prevented the shedding of HIV-1 in this body fluid; in fact, viral RNA was detected in all the women studied and the amounts of viral shedding was unrelated to the genital antibody response. On the other hand, none of the high-risk seronegative women had detectable antibodies to HIV-1 in CVL of either the IgG or s-IgA isotype. Our results a) confirm an impairment of mucosal antibody response during HIV-1 infection and suggest that mucosal immunity is not able to prevent viral shedding in the female genital tract and thus cannot modulate the infectivity of genital secretions; aa) do not provide evidence for a mucosal ""memory/protective"" antibody response in the genital tract of high-risk seronegative women."
6954,0.001,1.0000,"We documented HIV-risk behavior and the public health context of AIDS in women living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Sixty-one women were recruited from outpatient clinics and day-treatment programs at a state psychiatric hospital. They completed a survey that included measures of HIV-related risk behavior, the perceived importance of 11 public health and social problems including AIDS, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, perceived risk, and behavioral intentions. Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in at least one type of HIV-risk behavior during the 2 months before assessment, 23% reported two or more risk factors, and 16% reported three or more risk factors. Consistent condom use was rare. Participants reporting 1 or more risk factors were more likely than those reporting no risk to report histories of alcohol or drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing, and more perceived risk of HIV infection. Poverty and unemployment were viewed as more serious problems than HIV infection and AIDS. HIV-prevention interventions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women with a severe mental illness are urgently needed to prevent further infections."
3551,0.001,1.0000,"The silent period that follows infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and precedes seroconversion remains a problem for the screening of blood supply, and knowledge about the mechanism involved in the maintenance of latency is only fragmentary. Using purified nef recombinant protein and six synthetic nef peptides, antibodies to the product of an HIV-1 regulatory gene, the negative regulatory factor (nef) involved in maintenance of proviral latency, were detected by Western blot and radioimmunoassay techniques in HIV-1-seronegative, viral antigen-negative, and virus culture-negative individuals at risk for HIV infection. This antibody response to nef was correlated in eight individuals with the detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA by oligonucleotide hybridization, following enzymatic amplification of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such latent HIV infections have now been followed for up to 6 or 10 months in five individuals. In addition, retrospective and prospective analysis of HIV-1-seropositive individuals have shown (1) antibodies to nef preceding seroconversion, and (2) the persistence of antibodies to nef and of HIV-1 proviral DNA in a case of spontaneous complete HIV-1 seronegativation. Since DNA amplification cannot be currently considered for routine use, screening for anti-nef antibodies followed by confirmation by DNA amplification could represent a basis for new diagnostic strategies. Beyond their diagnostic implications, these findings, suggesting that regulatory genes of the HIV-1 provirus can be expressed prior to the initiation of virion synthesis, may also be applicable in the design of alternative vaccines against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

To circumvent the problem that HBV infection of human cells in vitro for production of stimulator/target systems for CTL analysis is not feasible, a panel of 22 overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire amino acid sequence of the HBV core (HBcAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were used to induce and to analyze the HBV nucleocapsid-specific CTL response in nine patients with acute hepatitis B, six patients with chronic active hepatitis B, and eight normal controls. By using this approach, we have identified an HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope, located within the NH2-terminal region of the HBV core molecule, which is shared with the e antigen and is readily recognized by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with self-limited acute hepatitis B but less efficiently in chronic HBV infection. Our study provides the first direct evidence of HLA class I-restricted T cell cytotoxicity against HBV in humans. Furthermore, the different response in HBV-infected subjects who successfully clear the virus (acute patients) in comparison with patients who do not succeed (chronic patients) suggests a pathogenetic role for this CTL activity in the clearance of HBV infection."
8538,0.001,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (ENF) is the first of a new class of antiretrovirals (ARVs) known as the HIV fusion inhibitors. Two phase III studies of ENF, TORO 1 and TORO 2, demonstrated that ENF given in combination with optimized background (OB) therapy significantly improved virological response, increased the time to virological failure, and increased CD4-cell count compared with OB alone among highly treatment-experienced patients. The present study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of ENF. Outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness were estimated using a Markov model. Viral suppression and immune reconstitution were determined from the outcomes of the clinical trials. Time to immunological failure, time to AIDS-defining event (ADE), and time to death were estimated based on published mathematical models of disease progression. Costs were based on published estimates of the use and costs of ARVs, cost of managing ADEs, and cost of laboratory and other outpatient services. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost per year of life gained, adjusted for quality of life. The combined effects of an increase in CD4 count and delayed time to virological and immunological failure with ENF + OB were predicted to produce a mean life expectancy of 7.4 years from initiation of therapy, which was 1.8 years (1.5 quality-adjusted lifeyears [QALYs]) greater than the life expectancy associated with OB alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness of ENF + OB was estimated to be Dollars 24,604 per QALY. ENF is projected to increase time to immunological failure, delay onset of new AIDS-defining events, and increase life expectancy by more than 1.5 years among treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients. The cost-effectiveness of ENF is comparable to many existing treatment and prevention management strategies for HIV."
5499,0.001,1.0000,"(1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was employed to noninvasively monitor neuronal injury in eight rhesus macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), whose immune system was compromised by CD8 T lymphocyte depletion and treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). SIV infection and CD8 depletion resulted in a rapid decline in cerebral N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, a sensitive marker of neuronal health. Within 3 months of SIV infection and CD8 depletion, four animals developed AIDS and severe SIV encephalitis. The other four macaques underwent daily doses of HAART beginning 4 weeks after infection/CD8 depletion. HAART involved drugs that do not penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) including 9-[2(R)-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine and a racemic mixture of D: -L: -enantiomers of 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'thiacytidine. HAART resulted in reversal of NAA/Cr decline after 4 weeks of therapy, and no virus or encephalitis was found in brain samples analyzed. These results indicate that the CNS injury in AIDS is entirely dependent on events involving the peripheral immune system mediated by trafficking of SIV-infected monocytes into the brain. The rapid decline in NAA/Cr with SIV infection/CD8 depletion and its rapid recovery with HAART suggest that: (1) infected monocyte turnover in the CNS is rapid, occurring in days to weeks; (2) there are endogenous mechanisms that reverse neuronal injury; and (3) a threshold level of infected monocytes/macrophages in the CNS is required to overcome the neuronal recovery processes. These observations explain the clinical success of antiretroviral therapy in reducing the incidence of HIV-associated dementia and minor cognitive/motor disorder and suggest novel targets for drug development."
2345,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and remains a serious health problem worldwide. Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the liver cell nucleus sustains HBV infection. Major treatments for HBV infection include the use of interferon-α and nucleotide analogs, but they cannot eradicate cccDNA. As a novel tool for genome editing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system developed from bacteria can be used to accurately and efficiently engineer and modify genomic DNA. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to target the HBV genome and efficiently inhibit HBV infection. We synthesized four single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the conserved regions of HBV. The expression of these sgRNAS with Cas9 reduced the viral production in Huh7 cells as well as in HBV-replication cell HepG2.2.15. We further demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 direct cleavage and cleavage-mediated mutagenesis occurred in HBV cccDNA of transfected cells. In the new mouse model carrying HBV cccDNA, injection of sgRNA-Cas9 plasmids via rapid tail vein resulted in the low level of cccDNA and HBV protein. In conclusion, the designed CRISPR/Cas9 system can accurately and efficiently target HBV cccDNA and inhibit HBV replication. This system may be used as a novel therapeutic strategy against chronic HBV infection. "
4556,0.001,1.0000,"Multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) expressing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are characteristically found in hyperplastic tonsils and adenoids, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome encephalitis, vacuolar myelopathy, and lymph nodes coinfected with opportunistic pathogens. We identified similar polykaryons in the hyperplastic gut-associated immune system of an HIV-infected patient. Colonic biopsy specimens from this patient with heme-positive stools were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization for HIV-specific RNA. No bleeding source was identified by endoscopic or light microscopic examination of the biopsied tissues. There was diffuse and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia with germinal centers. HIV RNA-positive and p24 gag-positive Langhans'-type MNGCs and mononuclear cells (MNCs) were present within the lamina propria The MNGCs and MNCs were identified as macrophages on the basis of TEM and expression of CD68, HAM56, and lysozyme markers. They also expressed S100 protein, a marker of dendritic/Langerhans' cells, but they lacked Birbeck granules by TEM. In situ hybridization demonstrated RNA expression by MNGCs, MNCs, and follicular dendritic cells. TEM revealed budding and mature HIV particles on the plasma membranes of MNGCs, MNCs, and follicular dendritic cells. We conclude, therefore, that hyperplastic gut-associated immune systems can contain HIV-positive MNGCs and MNCs of the type seen in tonsils and adenoids and opportunistic pathogen-infected lymph nodes. Associated with immune activation, macrophages can express markers of dendritic/Langerhans' cells, cell types derived from the same CD34-positive bone marrow progenitor."
7724,0.001,1.0000,"To provide a basis for improved prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection after liver transplantation, variations in the S and P genes of HBV under immunosuppression in vitro and their association with patient prognosis were investigated. For the in vitro study, HepG2.2.15 hepatocellular carcinoma cells stably producing HBV particles were treated with the immunosuppressants methylprednisolone (MP) and tacrolimus (FK506) at doses found to be non-toxic by the methylthiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) cell viability assay. MP dose-dependently inhibited HBV DNA expression in HepG2.2.15 cells, while FK506 did not, as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). By gene sequencing, both MP and FK506 were found to cause variations in HBV S, P, and S/P overlapping regions. MP- but not FK506-induced mutations were common in the glucocorticoid response element of the P region, while both immunosuppressants caused mutations outside the nucleoside analogue resistance sites. For the in vivo study, 14 patients with HBV-related end-stage liver disease re-infected after liver transplantation, and 20 cases without HBV re-infection as controls, were studied. Seventy-five percent of re-infected recipients showed multi-loci amino acid mutations at different sites besides lamivudine (LAM)-resistant loci in the P region, including in the glucocorticoid response element. Fifty percent of re-infected recipients had mutations in the ""a"" determinant region and flanking sequences. Re-infection was associated with negative serum hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG), as measured by a microparticle capture enzyme immunoassay. Nucleotide mutations in the S region caused missense or synonymous mutations, which caused synonymous mutations in the overlapping P region. These results showed that effects of immunosuppressants on HBV genes in vitro were different from those in clinical recipients. Positive HBV DNA and gene mutations pre-transplantation were factors affecting re-infection post-transplantation. Multiple mutations found in the P and S genes suggest that the formation of quasispecies contributes to HBV re-infection after liver transplantation."
2862,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA status in the liver when hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has developed, 35 paired nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues from 27 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive and 8 HBsAg-negative patients with HCC were studied by Southern blot analysis. The hybridization patterns of HBV DNA were different in the nontumor and tumor parts in 26 (96.3%) of the 27 HBsAg-positive patients. In the nontumor parts, integration of HBV DNA into the host genome was significantly less when compared to the tumor parts (15/27 vs. 25/27, P less than 0.05), whereas free replicative viral forms were significantly more frequent (17/27 vs. 7/27). The integrated HBV DNA in the nontumor parts showed discrete band patterns in the majority of cases (13/15). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was significantly associated with the expression of free replicative forms of HBV DNA in the tumor tissues. An integrated HBV DNA sequence was detected in the tumor part of one HBsAg-negative patient, but not in her nontumor counterpart. Our observation that discrete integrated HBV DNAs are present in the nontumor part, representing subclinical clonal expansion that precedes the development of HCC, suggests the risk of future new tumor growth from these cell clones."
1999,0.001,1.0000,"The lack of response to hepatitis B vaccination remains a problem for those individuals directly at risk of hepatitis B infection, particularly those who work in the health care industry. The factors associated with non-response to hepatitis B vaccination have been investigated in 86 non-responder health care workers who had received multiple 'S' vaccinations without sustained production of anti-HBs. This group received a recently developed hepatitis B vaccine, Hepagene, which included proteins derived from the envelope region of HBV, not present in currently licensed vaccines. The pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins were included in Hepagene in order to circumvent anti-HBs non-responsiveness which had previously been demonstrated in the inbred mouse model. The inclusion of these additional proteins in Hepagene enabled some seroconverion, from non-responder to responder; however, a proportion of the vaccinees remained non-responders and the reasons for this have been investigated here, with reference to HLA alleles and the demographic predisposition. Here the mechanisms that underlie hepatitis B vaccine non-response have considered the distribution of HLA alleles, age, sex, height and weight in addition to the T-cell responses to Hepagene derived antigens."
1028,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of the audit was to assess the implementation of the protocols developed by Lothian University National Health Service Trust for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against blood-borne virus infections. Patients at risk of infection after an injury were referred to the Department of Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for assessment. A brief description of the incident, the time of the incident, the time of referral and the decision made was documented. The notes of these patients were reviewed 12 months later for the results of prospective HIV test after each incident. There were 76 referrals to the GUM Department in year 2001. Occupational Health (OH) and the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Departments each made 35 referrals. The latter cases were exposures in community settings. Amongst A&E referrals the time interval between the incident and assessment was significantly longer than for OH referrals (P=0.001). Female health workers reported exposure incidents sooner than their male counterparts (P=0.01). Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV was offered to 22 (29%) of 76 referred individuals, and was accepted by 13 (59%) persons. The course of PEP drugs was discontinued by five (38%) of the 13 individuals after consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patients showed that they were HIV-seronegative. Five of eight individuals completed the course of PEP medication. Only 11 (14%) persons attended for serological testing for blood-borne virus infection three or more months after exposure. None of these 11 persons, one of whom had been given PEP medication, had become infected. Further training and emphasis on the necessity of immediate reporting of occupational incidents and consented post-incident HIV testing of the source patient is needed. The current guidelines appear to work fairly well, but further counselling of those with significant injuries to undertake HIV serological testing after appropriate time interval is required."
2872,0.001,1.0000,"A prospective study was conducted in 4339 HIV-positive clients at the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre (TRC-ARC) Anonymous clinic, Bangkok, Thailand between January 2003 and April 2008. A tuberculin skin test (TST) was done for all patients without a previous history of tuberculosis (TB). Nine months of isoniazid (INH) was given for all positive TST/no active TB. TST-negative clients were asked to repeat the TST annually. The study aim was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of INH prophylaxis for preventing TB in HIV-positive Thai patients. Of those patients, 4111 (94.7%) had a TST done; 1157 (28.1%) were TST positive and 799 patients started INH prophylaxis. In all, 551 (69%) and 633 (79.2%) patients completed 9 months and 6 months of INH, respectively; 176 (20.2%) patients had a negative TST at baseline and subsequently converted to positive. Only patients with a baseline CD4 >200 cells/μL (p=0.000) and currently on antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (p=0.000) were related to having a positive TST. This baseline CD4 level was also significantly related to higher INH completion rates at 6 months (p=0.000). Interestingly, none of INH completion patients developed active TB. The feasibility of INH prophylaxis in TST-positive patients in this setting is possible. However, the long-term advantage of INH prophylaxis in terms of TB prevention, especially in HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), is still an issue that needs more research."
3211,0.001,1.0000,"Various studies have been conducted to evaluate the role of antiretroviral therapy in the onset of cardiovascular risk among HIV-1-infected patients, while fewer data are available regarding antiretroviral-naïve patients. Our objective was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk among naïve subjects examining traditional risk factors, immunovirologic parameters, assessing the Framingham risk score (FRS), and detecting the presence of subclinical carotid lesions by means of color Doppler ultrasonography. One hundred seventy-two antiretroviral-naïve patients underwent color Doppler ultrasonography. An intima-media thickness (IMT) greater than 0.9 mm and/or atherosclerotic plaques were considered pathologic findings. Demographic, immunovirologic data, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease were collected. The 10-year probability of acute coronary events was assessed by the FRS. The statistical analysis was performed using t test and chi(2), Fisher's test, and conditional multiple logistic. Thirty-six patients (20.9%) had lesions at ultrasonographic investigation. The presence of lesions was significantly related to male gender (p = 0.005), age (p = 0.003), sedentary life (p = 0.05), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) group C or CD4(+) less than 150 cells/mm(3), and viral load (VL) > 100,000 copies per milliliter (p = 0.04). The presence of subclinical carotid lesions showed a highly significant direct association with the estimated FRS (p < 0.002). The presence of subclinical atheromasic lesion results was also high among antiretroviral-naïve patients. FRS is highly predictive of the lesions, but also an advanced stage of disease plays a significant role. Our data support the hypothesis that HIV infection per se is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. We recommend an ultrasonographic assessment both among patients with FRS 6% or more and among those in advanced stage of disease."
3160,0.001,1.0000,"Liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has an accelerated course in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. Some data suggest that HIV suppression achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) ameliorates HCV-related liver disease progression. The aim of this study was to test if there is overexpression of serum markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients and if the effect is counteracted by HAART. In a pilot, cross-sectional, and comparative study serum markers of liver inflammation (CK-18 and HGF) and fibrosis (HGF, MMP-2, and TIMP-1) were measured via ELISA in HIV-infected patients off and on HAART, HCV monoinfected, HIV-HCV coinfected off and on HAART, and controls (10 per group). HIV-HCV-coinfected off HAART patients with low CD4 counts had higher levels of M30, HGF, and MMP-2 than HIV-HCV-coinfected on HAART. HCV coinfection predicted higher levels of MMP-2 [B 65.82 (95% CI 3.86-127.78); p = 0.04], HGF [B 520.22 (95% CI 123.65-916.78); p = 0.01] and M30 [B 128.02 (95%CI 16.39-239.64); p = 0.03]. HAART use was a predictor of lower levels of MMP2 [B -83.18 (95%CI (-146.8) - (-19.52)); p = 0.01] and M30 [B -112.9 (95% CI (-221.3) - (-4.52)); p = 0.04]. Other factors analyzed including alcohol intake ware not associated with the studied markers. In conclusion, serum markers of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis are overexpressed in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients with advanced immunosuppression, while HAART has a ""protective"" effect."
1910,0.001,1.0000,"Few empirical studies have evaluated the mediating effects of quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
5259,0.001,1.0000,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains prevalent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Memory function is commonly affected. There is a need for a rapid, but sensitive screening tool. This study compares the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and a computerised battery cognitive assessment to establish if the questionnaire has potential as a rapid screening tool for HIV-associated NCI. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with an undetectable HIV viral load on stable HAART were eligible to participate. Asymptomatic NCI (aNCI) was defined as a performance score more than 1SD below the normative mean in at least two domains of the computerised test. Memory impairment (MI) was defined as a t-score more than 1 SD below the normative mean using the PRMQ. Forty-five subjects participated. The mean age was 48 years (SD 11), the mean CD4 count was 546 cells/mul (SD 271), and 84% were male. Of subjects, 14/45 (24%) had NCI and 15/45 (33%) had MI. Two subjects had both types of impairment. No significant association was found between the presence of aNCI and MI (p = 0.229, r = 0.18, 95% CI -1.2, 0.23). aNCI was statistically significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.38, r = 0.31, 95% CI -0.02, 0.001). MI was statistically significantly associated with the set-shifting cognitive domain of the computerized battery (p = 0.04, r = 0.326) and time elapsed since HIV diagnosis (p = 0.035, r = 0.316). High rates of asymptomatic NCI were observed in this cohort, especially in younger individuals. The memory questionnaire did not reliably identify HIV-associated NCI other than executive function deficits and based on our data should therefore not be used as a rapid screening tool for this purpose."
6886,0.001,1.0000,"Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) represents a valuable tool for genomic engineering due to its single-nucleotide precision, high nuclease activity, and low cytotoxicity. We report here systematic design and characterization of 28 novel TALENs targeting multiple regions of CCR5 gene (CCR5-TALEN) which encodes the co-receptor critical for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). By systemic characterization of these CCR5-TALENs, we have identified one (CCR5-TALEN-515) with higher nuclease activity, specificity, and lower cytotoxicity compared with zinc-finger nuclease (CCR5-ZFN) currently undergoing clinical trials. Sequence analysis of target cell line GHOST-CCR5-CXCR4 and human primary CD4 T cells showed that the double-strand breaks at the TALEN targeted sites resulted in truncated or nonfunctional CCR5 proteins thereby conferring protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro. None of the CCR5-TALENs had detectable levels of off-target nuclease activity against the homologous region in CCR2 although substantial level was identified for CCR5-ZFN in the primary CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that the CCR5-TALENs identified here are highly functional nucleases that produce protective genetic alterations to human CCR5. Application of these TALENs directly to the primary CD4 T cells and CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of infected individuals could help to create an immune system resistant to HIV-1 infection, recapitulating the success of ""Berlin patient"" and serving as an essential first step towards a ""functional"" cure of AIDS."
3261,0.001,1.0000,"This study assessed prescribing physicians' attitudes toward early initiation of HAART, three months after the dissemination of the first French official treatment guideline. Telephone interviews have been made in a national random sample of physicians with full- or part-time practice in hospital departments delivering care for HIV-infected patients. Questionnaires included hypothetical clinical cases. Logistic regression compared characteristics of respondents according to attitudes toward HAART. Among the 483 respondents (response rate = 87.0%), agreement was high with official recommendations to systematically initiate HAART with protease inhibitors (PIs) for patients with CD4+ cell counts < or = 300/mm3, following a diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection, or for HIV sexual risk post-exposure prophylaxis. Confronted with a case of a naive asymptomatic patient with stable 450 CD4+/mm3, 34.6% would prescribe HAART with PIs in any case, and 29.8% only if the patient has plasma viral load < or = 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml. The remaining 35.6% would not prescribe PIs and were older, had limited activity in HIV care and expressed more interest in alternative medicines. To avoid a confusing impact of variability of clinical attitudes toward uncertainties associated with antiretroviral treatments among HIV-infected patients, shared decision-making between patient and physician should be promoted for initiation of HAART."
3877,0.001,1.0000,"Twenty-six antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), targeting five different steps in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, HIV-1 phenotypic assays based on common cloning technology currently employ three, or possibly four, different recombinant viruses. Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors. Using a single standardized test (ViralARTS HIV), this new technology permits the rapid and automated quantification of phenotypic resistance for all known and candidate antiretroviral drugs targeting all viral enzymes (PR, RT, including polymerase and RNase H activities, and IN), some of the current and potential assembly inhibitors, and any drug targeting Pol or Gag precursor cleavage sites (relevant for PI and maturation inhibitors) This novel assay may be instrumental (i) in the development and clinical assessment of novel ARV drugs and (ii) to monitor patients failing prior complex treatment regimens."
707,0.001,1.0000,"An important aspect of the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) type 1 is its clinical latency, suggesting that the virus itself or the provirus may remain latent for extended periods of time after primary infection. Certain heterologous viral proteins or chemical and physical agents are able to reactivate latent virus. Since a common denominator shared by these agents is the ability to cause stress response in cells, we have examined the effects of oxidative stress mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on HIV-1 latently infected promonocytic cell line termed U1. After exposure to H2O2 in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 mM, the viability of the U1 cells decreased during 24 h before recovery. At 24 h post stress, the U1 cells began to express virus as assessed by elevated reverse transcriptase activities in culture supernatants. Immunofluorescence carried out on stressed U1 cells using anti-HIV-1 polyclonal antibodies showed that H2O2 leads to HIV-1 gene expression activation, but not to a release of viral particles from damaged cells. Additionally, using a HeLa cell line containing integrated the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we have shown that oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 allows transactivation of the viral LTR revealed by intracellular CAT activity. A stimulation factor of around 4 of CAT activity can be reached when these cells are treated with 0.5 mM H2O2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4953,0.001,1.0000,"Darunavir boosted by low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r), at a daily dose of 600/100 mg twice a day (bid), has been shown to be superior to alternative highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens for the management of treatment-experienced, HIV-infected adults in the phase IIb POWER trials and the phase III TITAN trial. Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving."
2425,0.001,1.0000,"In this study, we investigate the relationship of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and autophagy. HepG2 cells and HepG2 cells infected with HBV (HepG2.2.15) were transfected with GFP-LC3 (green fluorescence protein conjugated with microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) expression vector and autophagy status was then examined with confocal microscope. HepG2.2.15 cells were further treated with serum-free medium or 3-methyladenine (3-MA), and subjected to Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B polymerase protein detection by immunohistochemistry. Localization of the GFP-LC3 and the HBV proteins was observed by confocal fluorescence microscope. The level of SQSTM1/p62 protein was also evaluated by Western blot analysis. In contrast to a diffuse distribution in HepG2 cells, GFP-LC3 formed distinct punctate dots, which were further enhanced by nutritional starvation, in HepG2.2.15 cells. The expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg, was positively correlated with the autophagic intensity. However, no co-localizations were observed between HBV proteins and autophagosomes. Suppression of autophagy reduced the expression of hepatitis B polymerase and HBcAg, but not HBsAg. Western blot showed that SQSTM1/p62 protein level was declined in HepG2.2.15 cells comparing HepG2 cells, and further reduced while upon serum starvation. In conclusion, HBV infection induces autophagic degradation and autophagy. Autophagy is critical for HBV replication. However HBV replication does not take place in autophagosomes. "
8252,0.001,1.0000,"Twelve hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase (HBV-DNAp) and hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV-DNA) positive patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) were treated with doses of either 20 X 10(6) IU/m2 or 10 X 10(6) IU/m2 body surface of recombinant interferon (rIFN)-alpha-2A, I.M., twice a week, during a period of 6 months. No appreciable differences with respect to clinical history, liver function tests and markers of HBV replication between the two groups were apparent at the time of entry into the trial. At the third month of treatment HBV-DNAp became negative in 10 out of 12 patients (83%). After a 15-month follow-up, HBV-DNAp, HBV-DNA and HBeAg were negative in 7 out of 12 patients (38%) (responders). Furthermore, at 24 months, 2 non-responder patients became HBV-DNA and HBV-DNAp negative and one responder lost serum HBsAg. In addition, HBsAg concentration, GPT level and histological Knodell's index decreased significantly in the responder patients, while no changes were observed in non-responders. Five out of six patients who received a low rIFN dose responded to the treatment, and only 2 out of 6 with a higher dose. No unacceptable toxicity was noted in any of the 12 patients. All of them completed the course of treatment. The results suggest that long-term rIFN-alpha-2A therapy has an antiviral effect in CAH due to HBV infection and is well tolerated."
1518,0.001,1.0000,"The aims of this study were to investigate serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels at different clinical stages in patients with chronic HBV infection, and to determine the serum HBV DNA level that discriminated HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B(CHB) cases from inactive HBsAg carriers. In all, 222 patients, encompassing 68 HBeAg-positive CHB patients (HBeAg-positive, ALT-elevation), 89 HBeAg-negative CHB patients (HBeAg-negative, ALT-elevation), and 65 inactive HBsAg carriers (HBeAg-negative, ALT-normal), were tested. The ALT levels had been tested more than twice during the previous six months, and the serum HBV DNA levels were quantified by a polymerase chain reaction-based assay. The serum HBV DNA levels of the HBeAg-negative patients were significantly lower than those of the HBeAg-positive patients (median 2.7 x 10(4) vs. 1.6 x 10(8) copies/mL; p=0.000). In addition, the HBV DNA levels of the HBeAg-negative CHB patients were significantly higher than those of the inactive HBsAg carriers (median 2.2 x 10(5) vs. 3.2 x 10(3) copies/ mL; p=0.000). The optimal HBV DNA level for discriminating HBeAg-negative CHB cases from inactive HBsAg carriers was 2.0 x 10(4) copies/mL. The serum HBV DNA levels were lower than the cutoff value in 72.3% (47/65) of the inactive HBsAg carriers, and in 31.5% (28/89) of the HBeAg-negative CHB patients. The serum HBV DNA levels differed significantly between these two groups. However, the levels in the two groups overlapped extensively, preventing the definition of a differentiation cut-off value."

Aiming at analyzing these aspects of HCV and HBV infections in hemodialysis patients in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, we studied three hemodialysis units including 434 patients. Serology was used to detect anti-HCV and HBsAg. Reverse trancriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) of the 5'-noncoding region was used to detect circulating HCV RNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for genotyping. Seroprevalence varied from 26.5% to 11.1% for hepatitis C and from 5.9% to 0% for hepatitis B. Risk factors observed for HBV and/or HCV infections were the number of patients per dialysis unit, duration of treatment, number of clinics attended, number of blood units transfused, and lower level scholarity. Alanine aminotransferase levels were altered with a higher frequency in HBV or HCV seropositive patients. Half of ten patients, negative for anti-HCV, had detectable viremia by RT-nested-PCR, indicating that this technique should be used to confirm infections in this group of patients. The HCV genotype 1 was the most frequently observed, followed by the genotype 2, but no correlation was detected between genotype and clinical or epidemiological data."
5569,0.001,1.0000,"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which amplifies a fragment of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene present in all mycobacterial species, was developed and tested on 84 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from 51 patients with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection. The PCR products were characterized either by sequencing or by hybridization with nonradioactive oligonucleotide probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, M. avium, or M. genavense. Sequencing was successful for 26 samples compared with the 45 samples for probe hybridization. The sensitivity of DNA amplification compared with microscopic examination was 79.5%. A mixed infection was detected with M. genavense for only one patient who was infected with M. tuberculosis complex. In the group of 22 control patients, where no diagnosis of mycobacterial infection was made during life and no acid-fast bacteria were seen during the autopsy, four samples of one patient were positive by hybridization with the M. tuberculosis probe. This patient had a clinical history compatible with tuberculosis. This PCR method may be a powerful tool for the precise diagnosis of mycobacterial infections from histopathologic material, provided that several sections from the same specimen block are tested."
6102,0.001,1.0000,"Progress in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic is hindered by our failure to elucidate the precise reasons for the onset of immunodeficiency in HIV-1 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that elevated immune activation is associated with poor outcome in HIV-1 pathogenesis. However, the basis of this association remains unclear. Through ex vivo analysis of virus-specific CD8(+) T-cells and the use of an in vitro model of naïve CD8(+) T-cell priming, we show that the activation level and the differentiation state of T-cells are closely related. Acute HIV-1 infection induces massive activation of CD8(+) T-cells, affecting many cell populations, not only those specific for HIV-1, which results in further differentiation of these cells. HIV disease progression correlates with increased proportions of highly differentiated CD8(+) T-cells, which exhibit characteristics of replicative senescence and probably indicate a decline in T-cell competence of the infected person. The differentiation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells towards a state of replicative senescence is a natural process. It can be driven by excessive levels of immune stimulation. This may be part of the mechanism through which HIV-1-mediated immune activation exhausts the capacity of the immune system."
5981,0.001,1.0000,"Healthcare workers are at risk of occupationally-acquired viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
126,0.001,1.0000,"Although more than one in two HIV-infected persons may develop central fat accumulation soon after commencing antiretroviral therapy, the association between antiretroviral therapy and body fat changes has not been consistent across primary epidemiological studies. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effects of antiretroviral therapy on different measures of body fat, and to examine factors that potentially modify these effects. We searched for studies that compared body mass index, waist circumference, combined overweight/obesity, and central obesity between HIV-infected adults naive and exposed to antiretroviral therapy. Random-effects subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to identify potential effect-modifiers of the pooled associations. Sixty studies, comprising data on 53,199 HIV-infected participants, were eligible for the meta-analyses. Antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased body mass index (SMD: 0.17 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.07-0.26), waist circumference (SMD: 0.20 cm; 95% CI: 0.07-0.33), overweight/obesity (borderline significance: OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.99-1.86), and abdominal obesity (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.16-1.90). In addition, antiretroviral therapy was associated with significant increases in body mass index, overweight/obesity, and central obesity among patients with CD4 counts < 350 cells/mm3, but not among patients with higher CD4 counts (Pinteraction < 0.05 for all). Overall, exposure to antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased risks of generalized and central obesity, and risks may be exacerbated by lower CD4 counts. These findings suggest that weight management and obesity prevention programs may be worth considering as part of routine HIV care."
8323,0.001,1.0000,"Forty million people are estimated to be infected with HIV-1, and only a small fraction of those have access to life-prolonging antiretroviral treatment. As the epidemic grows there is an urgent need for effective therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines. Nonhuman primate models of immunodeficiency virus infection are essential for the preclinical evaluation of candidate vaccines. To interpret the results of these trials, comparative studies of the human and macaque immune responses are needed. Despite the widespread use of macaques to evaluate vaccines designed to elicit a CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, the efficiency with which CTL control immunodeficiency virus infections has not been compared between humans and macaques, largely because of difficulties in assaying the functional CTL response. We recently developed a method for estimating the rate at which CTLs kill cells productively infected with HIV-1 in humans in vivo. Here, using the same technique, we quantify the rate at which CTLs kill infected cells in macaque models of HIV infection. We show that CTLs kill productively infected cells significantly faster (P = 0.004) and that escape variants have significantly higher fitness costs (P = 0.003) in macaques compared with humans. These results suggest that it may be easier to elicit a protective CTL response in macaques than in humans and that vaccine studies conducted in macaques need to be interpreted accordingly."

Induced sputum and PCR were obtained at each outpatient visit or when any respiratory symptoms were present during a one-year period. All patients with a CD4+ count of less than 200 x 10(6)/l were given prophylactics against P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). PCR was conducted 111 times in 29 patients. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in 1 patient and CMV DNA in 4 patients. P. carinii DNA was not detected. PCR on induced sputum samples is sensitive for the rapid detection of the initial stage of respiratory events. PCP prophylaxis changes the clinical manifestations of HIV infection."
7223,0.001,1.0000,"The emergence of improved antiretroviral therapy has increased the life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, although there is an increased susceptibility to developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The risk for CVD is purported to be even higher among people with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection because of the increased inflammatory response, which may synergistically impact CVD risk. However, studies comparing CVD outcomes between HIV alone and HIV/HCV individuals have been discordant. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify and quantify the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and the risk for CVD. We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to December 2016 to identify studies that provided information on HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD, defined as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and stroke. We used a random-effects model to abstract and pool data on the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD. HRs were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and LDL cholesterol. Among the 283 articles reviewed, four cohort studies met inclusion criteria with a total of 33 723 participants. The pooled adjusted HRs for the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.07-1.40) compared to HIV monoinfection.

625,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute hepatitis in many parts of the world including Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though self-limiting in normal individuals, it results in ~30% mortality in infected pregnant women. It has also been reported to cause acute and chronic hepatitis in organ transplant patients. Of the seven viral genotypes, genotype-1 virus infects humans and is a major public health concern in South Asian countries. Sporadic cases of genotype-3 and 4 infection in human and animals such as pigs, deer, mongeese have been reported primarily from industrialized countries. Genotype-5, 6 and 7 viruses are known to infect animals such as wild boar and camel, respectively. Genotype-3 and 4 viruses have been successfully propagated in the laboratory in mammalian cell culture. However, genotype-1 virus replicates poorly in mammalian cell culture and no other efficient model exists to study its life cycle. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes genotype-1 HEV replication by inducing cap-independent, internal initiation mediated translation of a novel viral protein (named ORF4). Importantly, ORF4 expression and stimulatory effect of ER stress inducers on viral replication is specific to genotype-1. ORF4 protein sequence is mostly conserved among genotype-1 HEV isolates and ORF4 specific antibodies were detected in genotype-1 HEV patient serum. ORF4 interacted with multiple viral and host proteins and assembled a protein complex consisting of viral helicase, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), X, host eEF1α1 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 isoform-1) and tubulinβ. In association with eEF1α1, ORF4 stimulated viral RdRp activity. Furthermore, human hepatoma cells that stably express ORF4 or engineered proteasome resistant ORF4 mutant genome permitted enhanced viral replication. These findings reveal a positive role of ER stress in promoting genotype-1 HEV replication and pave the way towards development of an efficient model of the virus. "
6938,0.001,1.0000,"In 1999 a Swedish national expert panel published recommendations for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Recently, pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) products have been introduced, and an increased knowledge concerning treatment of acute HCV and HCV-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection has been gained. As a result of this, an update of the Swedish recommendations was developed following an expert meeting in October 2002. The panel now recommends the use of peg-IFN together with ribavirin as the standard treatment. Owing to the excellent response rates in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, these patients can be treated for 24 weeks without preceding liver biopsy. For patients with genotype 1 infection (with a slightly below 50% sustained response rate after 48 weeks treatment) and only mild histological disease, treatment can be postponed until future better treatment options become available. In patients who fail to achieve a 99% reduction (2 log drop) in viral titre after 12 weeks of treatment, discontinuation of therapy is recommended. Patients previously treated with IFN monotherapy and not having achieved a sustained virological response are recommended the same combination treatment as treatment-naive patients. IFN monotherapy is recommended in patients with acute hepatitis C. For children with chronic HCV infection, combination treatment is mainly recommended in clinical trials. For HCV-HIV coinfected patients, combination treatment is recommended and preferably given when blood CD4 counts are above 350/ml and before antiretroviral treatment (ART) is needed. Concurrent ART or prominent liver fibrosis requires frequent monitoring because of the increased risk for mitochondrial toxicity and liver failure."
1780,0.001,1.0000,"Viral tropism plays an important role in HIV pathogenesis. However, its correlation with the clinical outcome and following exposure to antiretroviral drugs are still unclear. HIV-1 co-receptor usage was examined in 206 infected individuals: 67 seroconverters, 52 chronically drug-naïve, and 87 antiretroviral-experienced patients. The V3 loop was sequenced from plasma HIV-RNA and co-receptor usage was inferred using a phenotype predictor software (http://genomiac2.ucsd.edu:8080/wetcat/v3.html), which classifies V3 sequences as R5 or X4. The overall prevalence of X4 viruses was 26.2%, with significant differences among groups: 13.4% in seroconverters, 25% in drug-naïve, and 36.8% in antiretroviral- experienced patients (P = 0.001). The presence of X4 variants in the latter group was associated with higher viral load (P = 0.002) but not with lower CD4 counts. There was no association between HIV tropism and gender, transmission route or age. Neither with the CCR5 Delta32 genotype. Moreover, no association was found between HIV-1 tropism and drug resistance mutations nor with failure to regimens based on either protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Finally, no significant association was found between IL-7 plasma levels with HIV-1 tropism. In summary, X4 viruses are particularly frequent among antiretroviral-experienced patients with high viral loads, irrespective of the CD4 count. Thus, CCR5 antagonists should be used with special caution in this subset of patients."
1992,0.001,1.0000,"We developed a mathematical model using a multiple source of infection framework to assess the potential effect of the expansion of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) coverage among those in medical need on the number of individuals testing newly positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on related costs in British Columbia, Canada, over the next 25 years. The model was calibrated using retrospective data describing antiretroviral therapy utilization and individuals testing newly positive for HIV in the province. Different scenarios were investigated on the basis of varying assumptions regarding drug resistance, adherence to HAART, therapeutic guidelines, degree of HAART coverage, and the timing of HAART uptake. Expansion of HAART lead to substantial reductions in the growth of the HIV epidemic and related costs. These results provide powerful additional motivation to accelerate the roll out of HAART programs aggressively targeting those in medical need, both for their own benefit and as a means of decreasing new HIV infections."
2736,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically decreases in vivo viral replication to levels below the level of clinical detection, but does not eradicate HIV-1 infection on the basis of persistent low-level or cryptic viral replication and latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. Immune activation therapy has begun to be used in attempts to increase the turnover rate of the latent virus reservoir through activation of infected cells that comprise this reservoir, in order to promote cell death and accelerate virus clearance. Recent reports have not demonstrated complete virus ablation. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation now appears as a safe, feasible, and reasonable approach for Aids-related lymphoma in patients who meet criteria for transplantation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells from a HIV-positive patient could be collected before the patient becomes infected with HIV. Then, the proposed treatment consists of the following assumptions. HAART keeps viral replication below the level of detection, limiting the infection to latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. It is presumed here that myeloablative conditioning regimen can lead to the killing of all the cells that, in theory, harbour the virus. The following transplantation of the autologous hematopoietic stem cells, collected before HIV infection, would allow the complete recovery. The hypothesis is to be tested on a suitable animal model. After the collection of hematopoietic stem cells, the animal is experimentally infected with the immunodeficiency virus. HAART is given after plasma viral RNA becomes detectable. By myeloablative conditioning regimen all the cells harbouring the virus are supposed to be killed. Then, as the viral load is kept undetectable by HAART, the animal undergoes autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Antiretroviral therapy is interrupted a month after engraftment has taken place. Although hematopoietic stem cells from man before infection with HIV are unlikely to be available, a successful test on the animal would suggest a new approach which could allow the cure of HIV in future."
5787,0.001,1.0000,"HIV subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation following HAART treatment failure are limited. We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
2893,0.001,1.0000,"Over a 15-year period, a white American woman was observed to have progressive hepatitis B that underwent hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positivity to anti-HBe positivity with development of cirrhosis. This patient was found to have a non-sense mutation in the second codon of the pre-C region of the hepatitis B virus genome after her anti-HBe seroconversion but not in her serum when she was HBeAg+. As controls, serial blood specimens were analyzed from 12 other American patients who spontaneously converted from HBeAg to anti-HBe, who underwent an interferon alfa-associated HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion, and who did not seroconvert with interferon alfa therapy. No mutations in the pre-C region were observed to arise in these individuals. In conclusion, non-sense mutations that occur in the pre-C region in locations other than the 28th codon can be associated with HBeAg negative progressive liver disease. This report of a non-sense mutation occurring over time is unusual in that it occurred in a white American patient."
7884,0.001,1.0000,"The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of adherence to prescribed antiretroviral therapy on virologic response measured repeatedly over time in HIV-infected patients. To this end observations on plasma viral load (HIV RNA) assessed in copies/ml are categorized into four clinically meaningful states, [0--50[, [50--400[, [400--2000[, [2000 and up. A time-dependent continuation ratio model is used to analyse longitudinal ordinal responses. The main challenge lies in modelling dependencies over time and using information contained in the data efficiently to establish a dynamic relation between observed patient adherence and viral load. Among the several measures of adherence investigated, two specifically account for long periods of time without intake. One is derived from the third moment of the inter-dose interval distribution, while the second reflects internal drug exposure using pharmacokinetic parameters. The approach is applied to a clinical trial involving 35 patients who were followed over 12 months. Results demonstrate a significant relation between patient adherence and virologic response."

The patients were suffering from thrombocytopenia and received betweeen 20 and 30 g of the contaminated lot 93F21AB11. GBV-C/HGV RNA could be amplified from the Gammagard lot 93F21AB11 using 5'NCR and NS5 primer pairs. All the four patients were negative in the GBV-C/HGV RT-PCR prior to therapy and until the end of the follow-up period. GBV-C/HGV IgG antibodies to the putative envelope (E2) were detected using the E2 HGV-env kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany) in Gammagard lot 93F21AB11 and in one patient before donation of immunoglobulin. Anti-E2 seroconversion was observed in one recipient, the other two patients remained anti-E2 seronegative until the end of the observation period. It is concluded that there is no direct evidence for transmission of GBV-C/HGV by contaminated intravenous immunoglobulin since GBV-C/HGV RNA was not detected in the recipients up to 1 year after administration."

This is made all the more feasible by the validation of once-daily treatment regimens for HIV. We have demonstrated that virological suppression can be achieved and maintained in as many as 80% of active IDUs who have received highly active antiretroviral therapy for 48 months. This approach has now been validated in first- and second-line therapy, as well as for the treatment of bacterial infections in this population, achieving therapeutic results similar to those reported in the general population. The model is now being applied to the treatment of HCV infection, focusing on patients with infection due to HCV genotype 2 or 3, in whom the likelihood of response may exceed 80%. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that, even in treating IDUs in the inner city, no patient is left behind."
9797,0.001,1.0000,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying potential altered susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in highly exposed seronegative (ES) individuals and the later clinical consequences of breakthrough infection can provide insight into strategies to control HIV-1 with an effective vaccine. From our Seattle ES cohort, we identified one individual (LSC63) who seroconverted after over 2 years of repeated unprotected sexual contact with his HIV-1-infected partner (P63) and other sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 serostatus. The HIV-1 variants infecting LSC63 were genetically unrelated to those sequenced from P63. This may not be surprising, since viral load measurements in P63 were repeatedly below 50 copies/ml, making him an unlikely transmitter. However, broad HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were detected in LSC63 before seroconversion. Compared to those detected after seroconversion, these responses were of lower magnitude and half of them targeted different regions of the viral proteome. Strong HLA-B27-restricted CTLs, which have been associated with disease control, were detected in LSC63 after but not before seroconversion. Furthermore, for the majority of the protein-coding regions of the HIV-1 variants in LSC63 (except gp41, nef, and the 3' half of pol), the genetic distances between the infecting viruses and the viruses to which he was exposed through P63 (termed the exposed virus) were comparable to the distances between random subtype B HIV-1 sequences and the exposed viruses. These results suggest that broad preinfection immune responses were not able to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection in LSC63, even though the infecting viruses were not particularly distant from the viruses that may have elicited these responses."
3539,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 DNA and RNA levels and T lymphocyte cell surface markers were measured in blood serum and cell fractions from asymptomatic infected patients to find novel virologic and immunologic features in early disease predictive of subsequent clinical disease course. Thirty-two patients with rapid disease progression (rapid CD4+ cell loss and progression to clinical AIDS) were compared with 25 patients with stable infections (constant or rising CD4+ cell counts, no clinical disease manifestations). All HIV-1 burdens measured by polymerase chain reaction were consistently higher in specimens from rapid progressors than slow progressors. For each patient, virus burden remained relatively constant throughout the study period (mean, 42-44 months). Flow cytometry also disclosed stable lymphocyte immunophenotype patterns that correlated strongly with subsequent rapid progression to clinical disease. Thus, in early HIV-1 infection, a constellation of high virus burden and in vivo costimulatory antigen and lymphocyte activation abnormalities is predictive of rapid disease course."
5812,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of our study is to determine the role of oxidative stress on hepatic damage in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the efficacy of antioxidant-enzyme system against oxidative stress. Furthermore, the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) plus lamivudine therapy on oxidative stress was also investigated. Nineteen patients with acute hepatitis B virus (AHBV) infection, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHBV) infection, 24 inactive HBsAg carriers and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. In control and patient groups, serum alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were measured. In CHBV group, after IFN-alpha plus lamivudine therapy for 6 months, these parameters were measured again. In all patient groups erythrocyte MDA levels were detected higher than control group (p < 0.05). Activity of CuZn-SOD was found to be the highest in AHBV (p < 0.05), and the lowest before the treatment in CHBV group (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the highest in AHBV compared with inactive HBsAg carriers (p < 0.05) and CHBV group before treatment (p < 0.05). Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the lowest in CHBV group before treatment compared with other groups (p < 0.05). In CHBV group there was a significant decrease of MDA levels after treatment (p < 0.05) while there was a significant increase in activity of CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px compared with pretreatment levels (p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was determined between MDA values and serum ALT levels, before and after the treatment (p < 0.05). Detection of the increase of MDA levels which is a product of lipid peroxidation in all patient groups, indicates that the oxidative stress is increased in HBV infection. Correlation between the levels of erythrocyte MDA levels and serum ALT levels supports the hypothesis concerning the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of HBV infection. Insufficiency of antioxidant capacity in CHBV and inactive HBsAg carrier groups may lead to progression of disease and results in fibrosis. Treatment with IFN-alpha plus lamivudine causes a decrease in products of lipid peroxidation and shows antioxidant activity via increasing the antioxidant enzymes. These data suggest that the addition of antioxidant agents to IFN-alpha and lamivudin combination therapy may be useful in CHBV treatment. Further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are required to enlighten the role of antioxidants on HBV disease progression and treatment."
2409,0.001,1.0000,"Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia have been observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex. To investigate whether red cells (RBCs) of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection were coated with IgG and/or complement (C3), blood samples of 239 patients were tested. The prevalence of a positive direct antiglobulin test on RBCs was 16.7 percent. By use of an enzyme-linked antiglobulin test (ELAT) to measure more accurately the number of IgG molecules per RBC in a group of 67 patients, 30 of the 67 individuals were observed to have increased numbers (mean, 155) compared to normal controls and to patients with hypergammaglobulinemia due to multiple myeloma or chronic liver disease. Hemoglobin level was correlated with the number of IgG molecules per RBC (p = 0.008), but no correlation could be demonstrated between those numbers and serum immunoglobulin (p = 0.10) or circulating immune complexes (p = 0.38). Our results with ELAT suggest that some AIDS patients may have specific binding of IgG on the surface of their RBCs, rather than nonspecific uptake; further clinical correlations are necessary to confirm these findings."
3864,0.001,1.0000,"Laboratory evaluation of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) may involve detection of antibodies to HIV-1, direct detection of HIV-1 itself, and measurement of an individual's immunologic status at the time of presentation. The ELISA is currently the preferred initial screening test, although a variety of other rapid immunoassays have also been developed. Methods defining the antigenic specificity of the antibody response, such as the western blot, have become standard confirmatory tests in this setting. CD4+ cell enumeration and the HIV-1 antigen capture assay are useful in predicting the course of HIV-1 infection and in monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Newer techniques of HIV-1 co-cultivation permit the characterization of viral isolates and the stratification of patients and facilitate monitoring of the effects of antiretroviral agents. The polymerase chain reaction is of value in identifying HIV-1 infection in individuals with inconclusive serologic results. Judicious use of other laboratory tests, including surrogate markers such as beta 2-microglobulin, also provides prognostic information potentially useful in clinical management of HIV-1-infected patients."
1912,0.001,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
7230,0.001,1.0000,"Like tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social inequalities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the care of patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings."
7029,0.001,1.0000,"We proposed the hypothesis that there is an antigen on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that cross-reacts with a male associated antigen to explain four observations: 1) sex differences in the responses to HBV infection, 2) sex differences in the prevalence of chronic liver diseases associated with hepatitis B, 3) the association of parental responses to HBV with the sex ratio (at birth) of their offspring, and 4) the relation of kidney graft survival with the combination of anti-HBs in the recipients and the sex of the organ donor. Patients with aplastic anemia treated with bone marrow transplantation from HLA identical sibling donors were studied to further test this hypothesis and the results provide additional support. Cross reactivity of HBsAg with H-Y antigen, however, has not been demonstrated."
3410,0.001,1.0000,"Symptoms of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and somatic symptoms of depression overlap, confounding clinical assessments of persons with HIV infection. This research examined the extent of this confounding. In Study 1, 71 persons with HIV infection demonstrated high rates of depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). However, depression scores correlated with symptoms of HIV infection. In Study 2, 63 persons with HIV infection also demonstrated high rates of depression on the BDI, and depression was again related to symptoms of HIV disease; specifically, persistent fatigue, diarrhea, night sweats, and muscle aches. Principal component factor analyses demonstrated that somatic symptoms of depression were closely associated with number of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome diagnoses, number of HIV-related symptoms, and inversely related to number of T-helper cells. In contrast, cognitive-affective depression was most closely related to anxiety, hypochondriasis, and number of months since tested HIV positive. Results support the conclusion that depression scores require differential interpretations at different stages of HIV disease and that persons who have experienced HIV-related symptoms only be assessed for depression using instruments void of somatic symptoms."

The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."

Only limited information about the epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection especially in females is available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and the possible factors for transmission in the female population of a largely urban city Islamabad. A cross sectional study was conducted from May 2006 to August 2006 in Islamabad. We select 252 female households (n=252) following the selection criteria. The primary outcome variables were HCV seropositivity and factors like history of major surgical procedure, blood transfusion, Intravenous drug use etc. The results showed mean age of the sample was 33.21 (±9.95) years and HCV seropositivity was present in 62 (24.6%) females. Final Forward Stepwise multiple logistic regression showed blood transfusion [OR, 10.094 95% CI 1.950-52.257], dental procedure [OR, 5.381 95% CI 2.315-12.507] and dilation and curettage [OR, 3.869 95% 1.867-8.015] were significantly associated with HCV seropositivity in females.

9745,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a survey of a random sample of California orthodontists and of general dentists to compare their infection control procedures. Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."
5109,0.001,1.0000,"The dynamics of emerging nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance in hepatitis B virus (HBV) are not well understood because standard dideoxynucleotide direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing assays detect drug-resistance mutations only after they have become dominant. To obtain insight into NRTI resistance, we used a new sequencing technology to characterize the spectrum of low-prevalence NRTI-resistance mutations in HBV obtained from 20 plasma samples from 11 NRTI-treated patients and 17 plasma samples from 17 NRTI-naive patients, by using standard direct PCR sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). UDPS detected drug-resistance mutations that were not detected by PCR in 10 samples from 5 NRTI-treated patients, including the lamivudine-resistance mutation V173L (in 5 samples), the entecavir-resistance mutations T184S (in 2 samples) and S202G (in 1 sample), the adefovir-resistance mutation N236T (in 1 sample), and the lamivudine and adefovir-resistance mutations V173L, L180M, A181T, and M204V (in 1 sample). G-to-A hypermutation mediated by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family of cytidine deaminases was estimated to be present in 0.6% of reverse-transcriptase genes. Genotype A coinfection was detected by UDPS in each of 3 patients in whom genotype G virus was detected by direct PCR sequencing. UDPS detected low-prevalence HBV variants with NRTI-resistance mutations, G-to-A hypermutation, and low-level dual genotype infection with a sensitivity not previously possible."
6791,0.001,1.0000,"Most hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in sub-Saharan African infants and children are acquired through horizontal transmission, but the exact mechanisms of spread have not been documented. The authors conducted a study in rural Ghana which determined seroprevalence in a probability sample of 1,385 individuals of all ages, and evaluated risk factors for horizontal transmission of HBV in a subsample of 547 children aged 1-16 years who were not hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. Most residents in this district live in compounds which typically contain 2-4 households each. Overall prevalence of HBV seropositives (any HBV marker) was 74.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72.5%-76.9%). Prevalence of HBsAg was 20.9% (95% CI 18.8%-23.1%). The data suggest a continuous nonuniform acquisition of HBV infection with advancing age predominantly through horizontal transmission in childhood, with the household, rather than the domestic compound, being the primary place for transmission. The behaviors most strongly associated with prevalence of HBV were sharing of bath towels (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.1-4.5), sharing of chewing gum or partially eaten candies (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.3-5.0), sharing of dental cleaning materials (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.6), and biting of fingernails in conjunction with scratching the backs of carriers (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.6-4.3)."
7341,0.001,1.0000,"Dried blood spot (DBS) is a reliable method of blood collection used for the diagnosis of several human diseases. DBS is particularly useful for diagnosing children and for the screening of high-risk populations especially in countries where health facilities are not readily accessible. This report describes a qualitative SYBR Green-based real-time multiplex RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes in DBS. Specific viral amplicons were identified in the same sample by their distinctive melting temperatures. The analysis of scalar concentrations of the reference samples indicated that this multiplex procedure detects at least 2500 copies/ml of HCV and 400 copies/ml of HIV-1. HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 20 patients infected with HIV-1 and/or HCV and in 5 healthy blood donors were also tested, confirming the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This method may represent a reliable alternative for the detection of HIV-1/HCV co-infection, in rapid and relatively inexpensive screening programmes."

In addition, hepatitis C infection can cause much more severe liver disease in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C infection in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B Hong Kong Chinese patients and the histological changes and hepatic expression of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. Five hundred and seventy-one Hong Kong Chinese asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B patients were studied. Only four (0.7%) were hepatitis C virus antibody positive; they were also all positive for hepatitis C viral RNA in serum by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Portal lymphoid aggregates and bile duct damage was noted in the liver sections of three of the four patients. Hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in three patients; none had detectable hepatitis B core antigen. By branched DNA assay, serum hepatitis B DNA could not be detected in any of the four patients, but three had hepatitis C RNA. By in situ RT-PCR, hepatitis C RNA was detected in the cytoplasm of three of the four patients. These findings suggest that hepatitis C coinfection in asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B patients is uncommon in Hong Kong Chinese and active hepatitis B viral replication is absent in these patients."
4363,0.001,1.0000,"To determine when the precore mutation at the 83rd nucleotide occurs, leading to the formation of a stop codon in the hepatitis B virus genome in carriers, which would indicate the presence of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), we investigated this mutation by direct sequencing and subcloning in 22 young hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg) (+) carriers. These subjects were 7-17 years old and were found during a survey for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in three elementary schools, a junior high, and a senior high school. None of these carriers had clinical manifestations, although one-third of them had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels. All were HBeAg-positive by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and 6 of them had preserved titers of anti-HBe at the same time. Precore mutations were found in 4 subjects (18.2%), with predominance of the wild type. Although 3 of these 4 had preserved titers of HBeAb, the other had no HBeAb titers. In an other 3 subjects with preserved titers of HBeAb, the precore mutation was not detected, even after the subcloning of viral DNA. The remaining 15 subjects with HBeAg showed no precore mutation. Subjects with ALT levels exceeding 100 IU/l were all HBeAg-positive without the mutation. It was clear that the precore mutation itself occurred in the subjects at an early age during the course of infection. However, the chronological relationship between the emergence of the precore mutation and the onset of hepatitis requires further study."

We measured inflammation biomarker levels in 158 predominantly virologically suppressed adults on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a range of body mass index (BMI) values from normal to morbidly obese. We assessed the relationship between BMI and each biomarker using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, race, CD4(+) count, tobacco use, data source, protease inhibitor use, and routine nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or aspirin use. Among normal-weight (n=48) and overweight participants (n=41; BMI <30 kg/m(2)), incremental BMI increases were associated with significantly higher serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP; β=2.47, p=0.02) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor 1 levels (β=1.53, p=0.03), and significantly lower CD14 levels (β=0.84, p=0.01), but similar associations were not observed in the obese participants. Among the obese (n=69; BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)), however, higher serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6; β=1.30, p=0.02) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (β=1.77, p<0.01) were associated with higher BMI, a finding not observed among the nonobese. Among all participants, IL-6 and TNF-α receptor 1 levels were most closely associated with hsCRP (p<0.01). Further studies are needed to determine whether higher serum inflammation biomarker levels found in obese HIV-infected individuals on ART reflect an increased likelihood of adverse health outcomes, or if novel markers to estimate mortality and disease risk are needed in this population."
7502,0.001,1.0000,"Ibalizumab (formerly TNX-355) is a first-in-class, monoclonal antibody inhibitor of CD4-mediated human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) entry. Multiple clinical trials with HIV-infected patients have demonstrated the antiviral activity, safety, and tolerability of ibalizumab treatment. A 9-week phase Ib study adding ibalizumab monotherapy to failing drug regimens led to transient reductions in HIV viral loads and the evolution of HIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab. This report characterizes these variants by comparing the phenotypic susceptibilities and envelope (env) sequences of (i) paired baseline and on-treatment virus populations, (ii) individual env clones from selected paired samples, and (iii) env clones containing site-directed mutations. Viruses with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab were found to exhibit reduced susceptibility to the anti-CD4 antibody RPA-T4. Conversely, susceptibility to soluble CD4, which targets the HIV-1 gp120 envelope protein, was enhanced. No changes in susceptibility to the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide or the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc were observed. Functionally, viruses with reduced ibalizumab susceptibility also displayed high levels of infectivity relative to those of paired baseline viruses. Individual env clones exhibiting reduced ibalizumab susceptibility contained multiple amino acid changes in different regions relative to the paired baseline clones. In particular, clones with reduced susceptibility to ibalizumab contained fewer potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) in variable region 5 (V5) than did paired ibalizumab-susceptible clones. The reduction in ibalizumab susceptibility due to the loss of V5 PNGSs was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Taken together, these findings provide important insights into resistance to this new class of antiretroviral drug."

Relapse at an unusual periclitoral site as well as disseminated carcinomatosis appeared within 2 months. Despite chemotherapy with cisplatin, bleomycin, and mitomycin C, the patient died within 3 months of relapse.

The (English language) literature was reviewed for all unique cases of syphilitic uveitis reported from 1984 to June 2008. For each case the following data were recorded: the clinical features of the syphilis, the uveitis and any associated neurosyphilis, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, lumbar puncture findings, treatment and follow up. We identified 143 patients in 41 original reports of syphilitic uveitis (93 HIV-positive and 50 HIV-negative). Posterior uveitis was reported in 79 patients (55.2%); panuveitis was reported in 36 patients (25.2%); anterior/intermediate uveitis was reported in only 28 patients (19.6%). Lumbar puncture findings were abnormal in 82 patients (57%), and the majority of these patients (76%, 62 out of 82) were HIV-positive. One hundred and ten (77%) patients were treated with intravenous therapy, usually penicillin. Most recovered from the syphilis, however, a proportion did not recover full vision. There were 13 (9%) treatment failures, which tended to occur in patients who were HIV-positive (n = 11), had abnormal lumbar puncture findings (n = 8) and/or were treated (n = 11) intravenously. There is a high incidence of abnormal lumbar puncture findings in patients with syphilitic uveitis and a strong association with HIV infection.

9893,0.001,1.0000,"In HIV-seropositive individuals, the incidence of acute pancreatitis may achieve 40% per year, higher than the 2% found in the general population. Since 1996, when combined antiretroviral therapy, known as HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), was introduced, a broad spectrum of harmful factors to the pancreas, such as opportunistic infections and drugs used for chemoprophylaxis, dropped considerably. Nucleotide analogues and metabolic abnormalities, hepatic steatosis and lactic acidosis have emerged as new conditions that can affect the pancreas. To evaluate the role of antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV/AIDS in a scenario of high incidence of acute pancreatitis in this population, a systematic review was performed, including original articles, case reports and case series studies, whose targets were HIV-seropositive patients that developed acute pancreatitis after exposure to any antiretroviral drugs. This association was confirmed after exclusion of other possible etiologies and/or a recurrent episode of acute pancreatitis after re-exposure to the suspected drug. Zidovudine, efavirenz, and protease inhibitors are thought to lead to acute pancreatitis secondary to hyperlipidemia. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, despite being powerful inhibitors of viral replication, induce a wide spectrum of side effects, including myelotoxicity and acute pancreatitis. Didanosine, zalcitabine and stavudine have been reported as causes of acute and chronic pancreatitis. They pose a high risk with cumulative doses. Didanosine with hydroxyurea, alcohol or pentamidine are additional risk factors, leading to lethal pancreatitis, which is not a frequent event. In addition, other drugs used for prophylaxis of AIDS-related opportunistic diseases, such as sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and pentamidine, can produce necrotizing pancreatitis. Despite comorbidities that can lead to pancreatic involvement in the HIV/AIDS population, antiretroviral drug-induced pancreatitis should always be considered in the diagnosis of patients with abdominal pain and elevated pancreatic enzymes.

1716,0.001,1.0000,"Opioid withdrawal is a crucial and recurring event during the course of opioid abuse that has a negative impact on the immune system. In this study, we investigated whether abrupt withdrawal (AW) or precipitated withdrawal (PW) potentiates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of human T lymphocytes. AW and PW enhanced HIV infection of peripheral blood lymphocytes and T-cell lines (Jurkat and CEMX174). In addition, both AW and PW induced HIV replication in a latently HIV-infected human T-cell line (J1.1). The enhancing effect of AW and PW was associated with the induction of neuropeptide substance P in both peripheral blood lymphocytes and the T-cell lines. The substance P receptor antagonist, CP-96,345, not only blocked AW- or PW-induced endogenous substance P expression but also abrogated AW- or PW-induced HIV replication in T cells. These findings provide a cellular mechanism that supports the notion that opioids have a co-factor role in promoting HIV infection of the immune cells."
7507,0.001,1.0000,"Substance P (SP) is a potent modulator of neuroimmunoregulation. SP receptors are present on human monocytes and T lymphocytes, and SP alters the function of these immune cells. We investigated the effects of SP on HIV-1 replication in latently infected human immune cells. SP significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in the latently infected promonocytic cell line (U1) and T lymphocyte line (ACH-2) stimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). When added to these cells in combination with TNF-alpha, SP also enhanced HIV-1 gag gene expression in U1 and ACH-2 cells. This stimulatory effect of SP was associated with the activation of HIV-LTR (long terminal repeat) driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression, and could be blocked by pretreatment of U1 and ACH-2 cells with an SP receptor antagonist RP-67,580, indicating specific SP receptor-mediated regulation. Furthermore, the addition of SP to the cultures of latently infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from HIV-1-infected patients enhanced HIV-1 gag gene expression. Thus, SP may play a potentially important role as a positive regulator of HIV-1 replication in latently infected monocytes and lymphocytes. These observations may have significant implications toward understanding the role of neuropeptide SP in the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and AIDS."
4859,0.001,1.0000,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) regulates B cell activation and differentiation and is an autocrine survival factor for memory B lymphocytes. We have reported recently that the number of memory B cells is reduced during HIV-1 infection. In this study we evaluated whether alteration in the NGF supply was involved in memory B cell loss in HIV-1-infected subjects. High rate of cell death in vitro was observed in memory B cells from HIV-1-infected individuals compared to uninfected donors (26.2 +/- 2.5%versus 7.9 +/- 1.4%, P < 0.001). The increased expression of Fas on memory B cells from infected subjects did not enhance the susceptibility of the cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro. The frequency of NGF detection in plasma from HIV-1-infected subjects was significantly lower than in healthy donors (33.6%versus 63.6%, P < 0.001). Also, the median plasma NGF in HIV-1-infected individuals was significantly lower than in uninfected controls (5 versus 14 pg/ml, respectively, P < 0.01). Interestingly, the plasma NGF level was correlated directly 1 to the percentage of memory B cells (P < 0.05). HIV-1-infected subjects with a low number of peripheral memory B cells had a reduced incidence of plasmatic NGF (7.4%) compared to patients with a normal level of memory B cells (37%, P < 0.01). Moreover, the addition of recombinant NGF (1 micro g/ml) to cultures of purified B cells reduced cell death of memory B cells from HIV-1-infected subjects from 24.04 +/- 3.0% to 17.4 +/- 1.3% (P < 0.01). HIV-1-infected individuals also carried higher levels of natural anti-NGF autoantibodies compared to uninfected subjects. In conclusion, we found that memory B cells from HIV-1-infected individuals are primed for cell death. Our study suggests an association between low frequency of plasma NGF detection and the increased cell death of memory B lymphocytes observed during HIV-1 infection. Low levels of NGF in plasma may be due to reduced supply or to NGF binding to natural anti-NGF autoantibodies."

Eighteen HIV-1-infected persons received recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; Filgrastim) 10 microg/kg per day, for 7 days. On days 4 and 5, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested by leukapheresis.

For 9 of 18 subjects, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels increased 4- to 100-fold (>0.6 log(10)) above baseline between days 4 and 7 and returned to baseline by day 27. Significant increases of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels occurred in 5 subjects despite 3-drug antiretroviral therapy. Changes in CD4+ and CD34+ cells during mobilization and harvesting were similar in all subjects whether they had or did not have increased plasma HIV-1 RNA levels. Thus, mobilization and harvesting of bone marrow progenitor cells from persons infected with HIV-1 induced a transient increase in viral replication in some patients but was not associated with adverse effects.

After 28 days, 54 responding subjects entered an open-label extension that allowed for the addition of nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and dose escalation to maintain durability. The drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated robust antiviral activity, with demonstrable superiority of the 750 mg and 1000 mg three times daily regimens. Thirty subjects who continued to receive therapy at 12 months attained a persistent 1.6 log10 reduction in HIV RNA, accompanied by a mean increase in CD4 cells of 180-200/mm3. Studies of viral genotype and phenotype after virus rebound revealed that the initial active site mutation allowing for nelfinavir resistance is mediated by a unique amino acid substitution in the HIV-1 protease D30N, which does not confer in vitro phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently available protease inhibitors."

Significant inhibition was noted at a 1:1 molar ratio of UC871 to RT, characteristic of a tight-binding inhibitor. Infectivity of the HIV-1(IIIB) laboratory strain was eliminated in a concentration-dependent manner following short exposure of isolated virion particles to UC781. Neither nevirapine nor certain other carboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitors were effective in this manner. Endogenous reverse transcription in UC781-treated virus particles was markedly reduced. Treatment of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells with UC781 did not alter virus production, but the infectivity of the virus produced by the cells during drug exposure was markedly reduced. Moreover, the infectivity of nascent virus produced by the UC781-treated H9 cells after removal of exogenous drug was dramatically attenuated. Similarly, pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected patients abolished the infectivity of virus produced by these cells after removal of exogenous drug, as measured by coculture experiments with uninfected cord blood mononuclear cells, indicating the utility of UC781 against a variety of clinical HIV samples. Importantly, preincubation of uninfected MT2 cells with UC781 rendered these cells refractory to subsequent HIV infection in the absence of extracellular drug, an effect that persisted for several days following removal of exogenous drug. These unique properties of UC781 indicate that this nonnucleoside inhibitor may have considerable promise for use in retrovirucidal formulations to minimize the spread of HIV from infected to noninfected individuals."
4077,0.001,1.0000,"Vaccine immunogens derived from the envelope glycoproteins of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that elicit broad neutralizing antibodies remain an elusive goal. The highly conserved 30 amino-acid membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV gp41 contains the hydrophobic epitopes for two rare HIV-1 broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10. Both these antibodies possess relatively hydrophobic HCDR3 loops and demonstrate enhanced binding to their epitopes in the context of the native gp160 precursor envelope glycoprotein by the intimate juxtaposition of a lipid membrane. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) S1 protein forms nanoparticles that can be utilized both as an immunogenic array of the MPER and to provide the lipid environment needed for enhanced 2F5 and 4E10 binding. We show that recombinant HBsAg particles with MPER (HBsAg-MPER) appended at the C-terminus of the S1 protein are recognized by 2F5 and 4E10 with high affinity compared to positioning the MPER at the N-terminus or the extracellular loop (ECL) of S1. Addition of C-terminal hydrophobic residues derived from the HIV-1 Env transmembrane region further enhances recognition of the MPER by both 2F5 and 4E10. Delipidation of the HBsAg-MPER particles decreases 2F5 and 4E10 binding and subsequent reconstitution with synthetic lipids restores optimal binding. Inoculation of the particles into small animals raised cross-reactive antibodies that recognize both the MPER and HIV-1 gp160 envelope glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface; however, no neutralizing activity could be detected. Prime:Boost immunization of the HBsAg-MPER particles in sequence with HIV envelope glycoprotein proteoliposomes (Env-PLs) did not raise neutralizing antibodies that could be mapped to the MPER region. However, the Env-PLs did raise anti-Env antibodies that had the ability to neutralize selected HIV-1 isolates. The first generation HBsAg-MPER particles represent a unique means to present HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein neutralizing determinants to the immune system."
7236,0.001,1.0000,"Tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives were shown to specifically block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication through a unique interaction with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."
8837,0.001,1.0000,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a product of T lymphocytes, B cells and macrophages, participates in Th-2 immune responses and modulates macrophage functions including possible interactions with pathogens. We have found that Chinese hamster ovary cell-derived human recombinant (hr) IL-10 inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strains Ada and Ba-L (HIV-1ADA and HIV-1Ba-L) replication in primary tissue culture-derived macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition by IL-10 treatment (> 5 U/ml) was effective 72 h before or 24 h after infection and cytokine activity blocked by anti-hrIL-10 antibody (19F1), or lost after heat inactivation of IL-10. Viral production was measured by determining p24 and reverse transcriptase levels while reverse transcription kinetics for the long terminal repeat (LTR) and gag were assessed at timed intervals after infection and quantified by 32P end-labelling. IL-10 inhibited early steps of infection without modulating cell surface CD4+ levels. The onset of LTR reverse transcription was delayed by 4 to 8 h and the number of LTR transcripts was decreased by 77% at 24 h and by 87% 48 h after infection. IL-10 effects were reversible; after cytokine washout, cells treated before infection showed lower levels of virus compared with those treated after infection. IL-10 biological activity was confirmed in three virus-independent assays. These results demonstrate IL-10 decreases HIV-1 reverse transcription upon macrophage infection and subsequently mediates viral latency in vitro. Therefore, IL-10 may be involved in the effective control of HIV-1-infected macrophages in vivo."
5927,0.001,1.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) improves health outcomes and prevents HIV transmission. Before 2010, HIV testing was available to inmates in the California state prison system upon request. In 2010, the California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) integrated HIV opt-out screening into the health assessment for inmates entering California state prisons. Under this system, a medical care provider informs the inmate that an HIV test is routinely done, along with screening for sexually transmitted, communicable, and vaccine-preventable diseases, unless the inmate specifically declines the test. During 2012-2013, CCHCS, the California Department of Public Health, and CDC evaluated HIV screening, rates of new diagnoses, linkage to and retention in care, ART response, and post-release linkage to care among California prison inmates. All prison inmates are processed through one of eight specialized reception center facilities, where they undergo a comprehensive evaluation of their medical needs, mental health, and custody requirements for placement in one of 35 state prisons. Among 17,436 inmates who entered a reception center during April-September 2012, 77% were screened for HIV infection; 135 (1%) tested positive, including 10 (0.1%) with newly diagnosed infections. Among the 135 HIV-positive patient-inmates, 134 (99%) were linked to care within 90 days of diagnosis, including 122 (91%) who initiated ART. Among 83 who initiated ART and remained incarcerated through July 2013, 81 (98%) continued ART; 71 (88%) achieved viral suppression (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL). Thirty-nine patient-inmates were released on ART; 12 of 14 who were linked to care within 30 days of release were virally suppressed at that time. Only one of nine persons with a viral load test conducted between 91 days and 1 year post-release had viral suppression. Although high rates of viral suppression were achieved in prison, continuity of care in the community remains a challenge. An infrastructure for post-release linkage to care is needed to help ensure sustained HIV disease control."

Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
6658,0.001,1.0000,"The public sector scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa commenced in 2004. We aimed to describe the hospital-level disease burden and factors contributing to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized HIV-positive patients in the era of widespread ART availability. Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."
2369,0.001,1.0000,"In 2014, an estimated 2,477 children aged <13 years were living with diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States (1). Nationally, little is known about how well children with a diagnosis of HIV infection are retained in medical care. CDC analyzed insurance claims data to evaluate retention in medical care for children in the United States with a diagnosis of HIV infection. Data sources were the 2010-2014 MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid and MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases. Children aged <13 years with a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2010 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic billing codes for HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), resulting in Medicaid and commercial claims cohorts of 163 and 129 children, respectively. Data for each child were evaluated during a 36-month study period, counted from the date of the first claim containing an ICD-9-CM code for HIV or AIDS. Each child's consistency of medical care was assessed by evaluating the frequency of medical visits during the first 24 months of the study period to see if the frequency of visits met the definition of retention in care. Frequency of medical visits was then assessed during an additional 12-month follow-up period to evaluate differences in medical care consistency between children who were retained or not retained in care during the initial 24-month period. During months 0-24, 60% of the Medicaid cohort and 69% of the commercial claims cohort were retained in care, among whom 93% (Medicaid) and 85% (commercial claims) were in care during months 25-36. To identify areas for additional public health action, further evaluation of the objectives for national medical care for children with diagnosed HIV infection is indicated."

This study examined two measures of compliance with HIV medical care: attendance of scheduled outpatient visits and use of the emergency room. Clients of two public HIV outpatient clinics were followed from time of health-care initiation to either death or the end of the study. The association of race, sex, age, and injection drug use (IDU) with these measures were examined in multivariate logistic regression. Models were adjusted for disease staging at time of entry and for length of follow-up time in clinic. Of 1824 clients followed, 15% failed to attend scheduled visits and 18.1% had at least one emergency room visit. Clients who missed visits were more likely to be African American, to have a history of IDU, and to have a CD4 cell count < 500/mm3 or an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic infection at entry. They were also more likely to have > or = 12 months of follow-up time in the HIV clinic, but were less likely to have entered into health care from an early intervention clinic.

We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24). Findings suggest the importance of community-based HIV prevention intervention targeting HIV-positive drug users not recovery HIV medical care."

It is a multi-centre, prospective observational study conducted between August 1997 and July 1998. The 483 patients, enrolled in five infectious diseases departments located in different areas of Italy, were stratified into four groups according to their CD4+ lymphocyte cell count and status of AIDS Defining Illness (ADI) at enrolment. Average direct hospital costs (L = Italian Lire, 1997 exchange rate US$ 1 = 1,704 Italian Lire) were L.23,725,584 (US$ 13,923.5), L.15,208,287 (US$ 8,925.1), L.11,942,761 (US$ 7,008.7) and L.7,660,942 (US$ 4,495.9) for the four groups of patients. More than 80% of patients in the first group and about 65% of patients in the second group received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The proportion of patients receiving HAART in the third and fourth group increased from 37.1% to 56.5% and from 15.3% to 31.5%. The number of hospital days observed in this study was much lower than previously published numbers in Italy. These results may indicate a shift of costs from hospitalisation to outpatient care and ARV."
9246,0.001,1.0000,"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in developing countries occurs through heterosexual intercourse or during birth from mother to child. It is critical to characterize the virus of the genital tract variants as a target for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine and microbicidal therapies. We compared the C2V3 env domain genetic diversity of HIV-1 in female genital secretions and in plasma from Ethiopian women seeking care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sequences within an individual differed between the plasma and cervicovaginal lavage (CLV) compartments with nucleotide and amino acid median difference values of 8.3 and 4.8%, respectively. Sequence diversity in CVL was greater than in plasma. And the V3 loop positive charge was often more elevated in CVL. These are markers of the differential evolution of the viruses in CVL and peripheral blood indicating that limited evolution at the site of contact is not the limiting factor determining the preferential transmission of macrophage tropic viruses."
1261,0.001,1.0000,"GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV), a recently discovered orphan flavivirus, is distantly related to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although both GBV-C/HGV and HCV can be transmitted by the parenteral route, their principal modes of transmission and associated risk behaviors may differ. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the 5'-noncoding regions of GBV-C/HGV and HCV were amplified from plasma or sera of 209 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). As verified by Southern blot analysis, GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection were detected in 37 (17.7%) and 22 (10.5%) of 209 HIV-1-infected individuals, respectively. GBV-C/HGV infection was significantly associated with homosexual sex (P = 0.044) and was more common than HCV infection among HIV-1-infected homosexual men (P = 0.006). The prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection was nearly equal in women infected with HIV-1 via high-risk heterosexual sex (14.0%) or injection drug use (IDU) (17.5%). By contrast, HCV infection was associated significantly with women reporting IDU when compared to women reporting high-risk heterosexual sex (P < 0.0001). Alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated in HIV-1-infected individuals who were co-infected with HCV (P = 0.009), but not with GBV-C/HGV (P = 0.9). The high prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection in HIV-1-infected nondrug-injecting homosexual men and among women engaging in high-risk heterosexual sex is consistent with transmission by the mucosal route and with acquisition of infection by the receptive rather than insertive partner."

This study tested 1,206 sera collected from patients aged 1-25 years from various health facilities across the country for HBV serological markers and HBV DNA. Based on the year the vaccine was introduced, samples were stratified by age into pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations, which were then compared for evidence of immunity and chronic carriage using the Chi-square test. Where HIV status was known, subset analyses were performed. Immunity to HBV infection increased from 13.0% in the pre- to 57.0% in the post-vaccine introduction population (P < 0.001). This decreased with increasing age within the post-vaccine introduction population (76.1% for 1-5 years, 50.0% for 6-10 years, and 46.3% for 11-16 years). In addition, HBV chronic carriage was significantly (P = 0.003) reduced in the post- (1.4%) compared to the pre-vaccine introduction population (4.2%). The difference in prevalence of active HBV infection in the serologically exposed pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations was not statistically significant. Subset analyses showed that evidence of immunity was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the HIV negative compared to the HIV positive subset in both populations. Universal hepatitis B vaccination has been a remarkable success, with a significant increase in immunity to HBV infection. The observation that HBV chronic carriage increases as immunity wanes over time calls into question whether the time has come to consider a pre-adolescence vaccine booster dose policy."
9226,0.001,1.0000,"A heterosexual partner study was carried out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 1990 to December 1991. The main objectives were to determine the rate of male-to-female transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to determine risk factors. Male index cases were recruited according to the following criteria: 1) confirmed HIV positivity, 2) 18 years old or older; 3) heterosexual contact within the past year. Only female partners who reported not to have other risk factors but to have had sexual contact with the index case were invited to participate. Couples were interviewed for risk factors and had blood collected for laboratory studies. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 45 percent among 204 female partners in the study. Using logistic regression, the authors found the following factors to be independently (p < 0.05) associated with HIV infection: 1) anal sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-7.45); 2) condom use during vaginal sex sometimes (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96), rarely (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.83), or never (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.23-7.50) as compared with always; 3) frequency of sexual contacts in the year prior to interview (100+) (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.91); and 4) oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 0.97-4.29).

1111,0.001,1.0000,"In the United States, approximately one in three new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are transmitted via heterosexual contact. To monitor HIV risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among heterosexuals and other populations, CDC surveys persons in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), using the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS). This report summarizes data collected from heterosexuals in 24 MSAs with a high prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that participated in NHBS during 2006-2007. Of 14,837 heterosexuals aged 18-50 years who were interviewed and tested, 2.0% were HIV infected. HIV prevalence was higher among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). For example, HIV prevalence was 2.8% among participants with less than a high school education compared with 1.2% among those with more than a high school education, 2.6% among participants who were unemployed compared with 1.0% among those who were employed, and 2.3% among participants with annual household incomes at or below the poverty level compared with 1.0% among those with incomes above the poverty level. This association between HIV prevalence and SES could not be attributed to factors commonly associated with HIV infection risk in heterosexuals, such as using crack cocaine, exchanging sex for things such as money or drugs, or being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Based on the association observed between HIV prevalence and SES, HIV prevention activities targeted at heterosexuals in urban areas with high AIDS prevalence should be focused on those with lower SES."

The AIDS cases (20) presented mainly with tuberculosis, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary. The mode of infection, both in the HIV seropositive and AIDS cases, was mainly heterosexual relationship followed by blood transfusion. In a few cases, infection was perinatally transmitted. In the limited number of HIV positive contacts studied, seven were confirmed as Western Blot positive.

9231,0.001,1.0000,"We previously reported a significant reduction in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) from 2007 to 2012 in people who inject drugs (PWID; 35.9% to 18.5%, p < 0.001) and female sex workers (FSW; 23.1% to 9.8%, p < 0.05), but not in blood donors (BD) or pregnant women, in Haiphong, Vietnam. Our aim in the present study was to assess trends in the prevalence of infection with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively). We also investigated the coinfection rates of HBV and HCV with HIV in the same groups. Between 2007 and 2012, HBV prevalence was significantly decreased in BD (18.1% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.007) and slightly decreased in FSW (11.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.21), but not in PWID (10.7% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.84). HCV prevalence was significantly decreased in PWID (62.1% in 2007 vs. 42.7% in 2008, p < 0.0001), but it had rebounded to 58.4% in 2012 (2008 vs. 2012, p < 0.0001). HCV prevalence also increased in FSW: 28.6% in 2007 and 2009 vs. 35.3% in 2012; however, this difference was not significant (2007 vs. 2012, p = 0.41). Rates of coinfection with HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID and FSW did not change significantly during the study period. Our findings suggest that the current harm reduction programs designed to prevent HIV transmission in PWID and FSW may be insufficient to prevent the transmission of hepatitis viruses, particularly HCV, in Haiphong, Vietnam. New approaches, such as the introduction of catch-up HBV vaccination to vulnerable adult populations and the introduction of HCV treatment as prevention, should be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality due to HIV and hepatitis virus coinfection in Vietnam."

We randomly selected 150 case patients and 150 control patients whose AIDS diagnosis was made during 1994 to 1996 (male:female, 2:1) from among 19,238 persons reported to the NYC Health Department HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Case patients had died of AIDS-related causes in 1996. Control patients, category matched with case patients on gender, were not known to have died by the end of 1996. Analysis was performed on 279 patients (142 cases and 137 controls). Cases and controls were similar in age, gender, race, HIV transmission category, and health insurance coverage. The median baseline CD4 count was 30 cells/microL for those who died and 103 cells/microL for survivors (p < 0.001). The prescription of HAART (antiretroviral combination that includes at least one protease inhibitor) in 1996 was strongly associated with survival in univariate analysis (OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 2.5-10.2). This association remained in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, race, health insurance status, HIV transmission categories, year of AIDS diagnosis, baseline CD4 count, and other antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI = 3.5-20.7). Prescription of combination therapy other than HAART in 1996 and baseline CD4 count were also associated with survival, but less strongly so. The survival benefit of HAART extends beyond the confines of a few highly selected patients into the ""real world,"" reducing AIDS deaths at the population level. This population-based study supports the likelihood that the introduction of HAART in 1996 played a primary role in the decline in NYC AIDS mortality."

Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."
5227,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is capable of infiltrating the brain and infecting brain cells. In the years following HIV infection, patients show signs of various levels of neurocognitive problems termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of HIV-dementia, which is the most severe form of HAND, the milder forms have become more prevalent today due to the increased life expectancy of infected individuals. Pre-HAART era markers such as HIV RNA level, CD4+ count, TNF-α, MCP-1 and M-CSF are not able to clearly distinguish mild from advanced HAND. One promising approach for new biomarker discovery is the identification and quantitation of proteins that are post-translationally modified by oxidative and nitrosative species. The occurrence of oxidative and nitrosative stress in HIV-infected brain, both through the early direct and indirect effects of viral proteins and through the later effect on mitochondrial integrity during apoptosis, is well-established. This review will focus on how the reactive species are produced in the brain after HIV infection, the specific oxidative and nitrosative species that are involved in the post-translational modification of the brain proteome, and the methods that are currently used for the detection of such modified proteins. This review also provides an overview of related research pertaining to oxidative stress-related HAND using cerebrospinal fluid and human brain tissue. "

The median plasma HIV RNA level was 4.77 log(10) copies/mL at baseline and decreased by a median of 3.5 log(10) copies/mL at 24 weeks, with 98% and 93% of patients achieving plasma HIV RNA levels <400 and <50 copies/mL, respectively. The median CD4 cell count was 373 cells/microL at baseline and increased by a median of 159 cells/microL at week 24. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate central nervous system symptoms (73% of patients), diarrhea (33%), rashes (10%), and biochemical abnormalities. Adverse reactions led to permanent drug discontinuation in only 1 patient. The once-daily combination therapy of emtricitabine, didanosine, and efavirenz was safe and demonstrated strong antiviral and immunologic effects that lasted for the 24-week period of the study."
9291,0.001,1.0000,"Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during the clinical latency phase with drugs inhibiting reverse transcriptase (RT) reduces the HIV-1 RNA load and increases the CD4+ T-cell count. Typically, however, the virus evolves mutations in the RT gene that circumvent the drugs. We develop a mathematical model for this situation. The model distinguishes quiescent from activated CD4+ T cells, incorporates the fact that only activated cells can become productively infected by HIV-1, embodies empirical estimates for the drug resistance and the mutation frequency for each of the HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants, and assumes the antiviral immune response to remain constant over the course of the experiments. We analyze clinical data on the evolution of drug-resistant mutants for the RT inhibitors lamivudine and zidovudine. The results show that the evolutionary sequence of the drug-resistant mutants in both data sets is accounted for by our model, given that lamivudine is more effective than zidovudine. Thus, current empirical estimates of the mutation frequencies and the drug resistances of the mutants suffice for explaining the data. We derive a critical treatment level below which the wild-type HIV-1 RNA load can rebound before the first drug-resistant mutant appears. Our zidovudine data confirm this to be the case. Thus, we demonstrate in the model and the data that the rebound of the HIV-1 RNA load in the case of zidovudine is due to the outgrowth of wild-type virus and the first drug-resistant mutant, whereas that in the case of lamivudine can only be due to the drug-resistant mutants. The evolution of drug resistance proceeds slower in the case of zidovudine because (i) zidovudine is not as effective as lamivudine and (ii) the first zidovudine drug-resistant mutant is competing with the rebounding wild-type virus."
3074,0.001,1.0000,"To identify signals that can alter leukocyte function in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed single blood samples from 74 HIV-1-infected patients and additional blood was collected at 90-day intervals from 51 HIV-1-infected patients over a 516 +/- 172 (mean +/- SD) day interval. Despite the absence of circulating immune complexes and normalization of phagocytic function, compared with controls, the fraction of patients' monocytes expressing CD49e and CD62L was decreased and expression of CD11b and CD86 increased. Plasma from 63% of patients but none from normal controls contained 110-120 kDa fibronectin fragments (FNf). Presence of FNf did not reflect poor adherence to therapy. Addition of FNf to normal donor blood in vitro replicated changes in monocyte CD49e, CD62L, CD11b, and CD86 seen in vivo. FNf also induced monocytes to release a serine proteinase, nominally identified as proteinase-3, that hydrolyzed cell surface CD49e. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin blocked FNf-induced shedding of CD49e in a dose-dependent manner. Plasma with a normal frequency of CD49e(+) monocytes contained antiproteases that partially blocked FNf-induced monocyte CD49e shedding, whereas plasma from patients with a low frequency of CD49e(+) monocytes did not block this effect of FNf. Electrophoretic analyses of plasma from the latter group of patients suggested that a significant fraction of their alpha(1)-antitrypsin was tied up in high molecular mass complexes. These results suggest that monocyte behavior in HIV-1-infected patients may be influenced by FNf and the ratio of protease and antiproteases in the cells' microenvironment."

In this study semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is compared with a new branched DNA signal amplification methodology. Samples from HCV-infected patients as well as from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase PCR correlated well with the branched DNA assay (r = 0.7036, P < 0.05). HCV RNA was found to occur at significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with titers in those infected with HCV alone.

5591,0.001,1.0000,"Primary viral infections, including primary HIV infection, trigger intense activation of the immune system, with marked expansion of CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells. Whether this expansion involves only viral-specific cells or includes a degree of bystander activation remains a matter of debate. We therefore examined the activation status of EBV-, CMV-, and influenza virus (FLU)-specific CD8(+) T cells during primary HIV infection, in comparison to HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. The activation markers CD38 and HLA-DR were strongly expressed on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, CD38 expression was also up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells specific for other viruses, albeit to a lesser extent. Activation marker expression returned to normal or near-normal values after 1 year of highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV viral load correlated with CD38 expression on HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells but also on EBV-, CMV-, and FLU-specific CD8(+) T cells. In primary HIV infection, EBV-specific CD8(+) T cells also showed increased Ki67 expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression, compared with values observed in HIV-seronegative control subjects. These results show that bystander activation occurs during primary HIV infection, even though HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells express the highest level of activation. The role of this bystander activation in lymphocyte homeostasis and HIV pathogenesis remains to be determined."

The indication for treatment with human gammaglobulin in patients with this syndrome has been well established. Here we report a case history of a patient diagnosed of common variable immunodeficiency, and she had treatment with i.v. commercial gammaglobulin. In the course of the disease, she developed symptoms that make us think about the possibility of hepatitis virus infection. HBV-associated antigens and antibodies, and HCV-Ab were all negative. So, amplification of HCV-RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, and it became positive in two different determinations. Liver failure got worse quickly and the patient died. About the course of the HCV infection, only 30% of patients with acute hepatitis get biochemical resolution, and 50-70% become carriers and have persistent chronic hepatitis or active chronic hepatitis. In this case, HCV infection showed an unusual acute and fatal course, it is possible that the impaired immune status of the patient could play a role in the acute course of the disease. Therefore, every patient who have intravenous immunoglobulin replacement must be monitored regularly for liver function tests, and by PCR for HCV infection."
7373,0.001,1.0000,"The dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transcription was analyzed in vitro and in vivo by using a specific molecular approach which allows accurate quantitation of the different classes of viral mRNAs. Unspliced (US) and multiply spliced (MS) HIV-1 transcripts were assayed by competitive reverse transcription (cRT)-PCR, using a single competitor RNA bearing in tandem internally deleted sequences of both template species. Acute HIV-1 infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes/macrophages cells, and the A3.01 T-lymphocyte-derived cell line was studied; both classes of HIV-1 mRNAs increased exponentially (r2 > 0.98) at days 1 to 3 and 1 to 4 postinfection in HIV(IIIB)-infected A3.01 cells and PBMCs, respectively, whereas monocytes/macrophages infected with monocytotropic HIV(BaL) exhibited a linear (r2 = 0.81 to 0.94) accumulation of US and MS transcripts. Following induction of chronically infected ACH-2 cells, MS transcripts increased 2 h postinduction and peaked at 5 h (doubling time, 58 min), while at 24 h, US mRNAs increased 3,053-fold compared with basal time (doubling time, 137 min). To address the biopathological significance of HIV-1 expression pattern during infection progression, pilot cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were carried out with samples from untreated and treated HIV-1-infected patients. In almost all untreated (recently infected, long-term nonprogressor, and progressor) patients, MS transcript levels followed the general trend of systemic HIV-1 activity. In patients under treatment with powerful antiretroviral compounds, viral MS transcripts rapidly fell to undetectable levels, indicating that in vivo, levels of MS mRNAs in PBMCs are closely associated with the number of newly infected cells and suggesting a new role for the quantitative analysis of HIV-1 transcription in infected patients."

Sera from 181 inmates were analysed for HAV antibody, hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibody, HDV antibody, HIV antibody and HCV genotypes. Prevalence of HAV antibody, HBcAb, HBsAg, HCV antibody, HDV antibody and HIV antibody were 99.4, 4.4, 0.0, 10.0, 0.0 and 0.6% respectively. HCV genotype 1a predominated in HCV-infected inmates (62.5%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (25%) and HCV genotype 3 (12.5%). An association between HBV infection and age > 30 years was found. HCV infection was associated with being born in Durango City, history of hepatitis, ear piercing, tattooing, drug abuse history, intravenous drug use and lack of condom use. We concluded that the prevalence of HAV, HBV, HDV and HIV infections in inmates in Durango, Mexico were comparable to those of the Mexican general population and blood donors, but lower than those reported in other prisons around the world. However, HCV infection in inmates was higher than that reported in Mexican blood donors but lower than those reported in other prisons of the world. These results have implications for the optimal planning of preventive and therapeutic measures."
5301,0.001,1.0000,"Liver transplantation is currently considered definitive therapy for end-stage liver disease (1-4). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects a large group of candidates for liver transplantation (1-4), however, liver transplantation for HBV is associated with unique and serious problems due to post-transplant predisposition for HBV re-infection of the allograft (5-10, 12-14). Patients with actively replicating HBV infection, as demonstrated by positive pre-transplant hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV-DNA, patients retransplanted for HBV infection, patients not receiving long term hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) therapy (5-10, 12, 14), and patients of Asian descent (15), appear to be most likely to experience clinically significant recurrent hepatitis (2, 3, 6-14). Recurrent HBV can produce acute or chronic liver disease leading to graft failure, retransplantation, or death (2, 3, 5, 13, 14). For these reasons, liver transplantation for HBV remains controversial. In this review, we describe the proposed mechanisms, predisposing factors, and clinical presentation associated with HBV recurrence in liver allograft recipients. We also discuss current and potential methods of prevention of HBV infection following liver transplantation."
6621,0.001,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are nucleotide analogs that inhibit the replication of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lamivudine (3TC)-resistant virus in HBV-infected patients, including those who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. The combination of ADV or TDF with other nucleoside analogs is a proposed strategy for managing antiviral drug resistance during the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral ADV or TDF, alone or in combination with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC), against chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study in the woodchuck, an established and predictive model for antiviral therapy. Once-daily treatment for 48 weeks with ADV plus 3TC or TDF plus FTC significantly reduced serum WHV viremia levels from the pretreatment level by 6.2 log(10) and 6.1 log(10) genome equivalents/ml serum, respectively, followed by TDF plus 3TC (5.6 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV alone (4.8 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV plus FTC (one survivor) (4.4 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), TDF alone (2.9 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), 3TC alone (2.7 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), and FTC alone (2.0 log(10) genome equivalents/ml). Individual woodchucks across all treatment groups also demonstrated pronounced declines in serum WHV surface antigen, characteristically accompanied by declines in hepatic WHV replication and the hepatic expression of WHV antigens. Most woodchucks had prompt recrudescence of WHV replication after drug withdrawal, but individual woodchucks across treatment groups had sustained effects. No signs of toxicity were observed for any of the drugs or drug combinations administered. In conclusion, the oral administration of 3TC, FTC, ADV, and TDF alone and in combination was safe and effective in the woodchuck model of HBV infection."
9997,0.001,1.0000,"Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the graft is the major problem for patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation, which could be potentiated by the immunosuppression. In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."
6279,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major global health burden. Currently, the approved therapeutic regimens include nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and either interferon or pegylated interferon. NA therapy is generally safe and well tolerated, but the rate of posttreatment virologic relapse is high, making NA treatment a lifetime commitment. The benefits of pegylated interferon treatment include a finite duration, more-durable response and absence of viral resistance. However, sustained response to interferon alone is achieved only in a minority of patients, and side effects are common, which limit its clinical use. Given that HBV covalently closed circular DNA and the integrated HBV genome persist stably in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, elimination (complete cure) of HBV is rarely achieved. After completion of treatment, sustained HBV surface antigen loss, with or without seroconversion to HBV surface antibody positivity (ie, functional cure), is therefore recommended as the ideal end point for anti-HBV treatment, despite the lack of complete eradication of HBV. Theoretically, combination of antiviral agents with differential mechanisms of actions on HBV, including viral suppression combined with immune modulation (as occurs during treatment with NA plus pegylated interferon), is an encouraging strategy to treat chronic hepatitis B. Recent studies have confirmed certain virological and serological advantages of simultaneous administration of NA and pegylated interferon (de novo combination therapy) or addition of pegylated interferon to ongoing NA therapy (sequential combination therapy) over monotherapy. Few data exist, however, on the long-term outcomes of patients receiving combination therapy. This review summarizes current combination therapy developed to cure chronic HBV infection."

The number of patients worldwide who are known to have undergone such procedures, been notified, and subsequently tested is still too small to be confident that the risk of HIV transmission in these circumstances is negligible. We describe a patient notification exercise, undertaken in the United Kingdom in 1991. Attempts were made to contact 1217 patients, in three health districts (A, B, and C), who had undergone surgical procedures performed by an obstetrician/gynaecologist who was infected with HIV. The exercise aimed to offer the patients reassurance, counselling and--if they wished--HIV testing. One thousand one hundred and forty-two patients (94%) were contacted, and all 520 who elected to be tested were negative for anti-HIV. The proportion of identified patients tested was 63% in district A, 35% in district B, and 61% in district C. Surgical procedures were classified retrospectively according to the likely risk (none, possible, or high) of exposure to the doctor's blood and, therefore, risk of HIV transmission. One hundred and ninety-five of those tested had undergone a procedure that carried a high risk of exposure; 179 had undergone a procedure thought to carry no risk. Patients in districts A and C who had undergone a procedure that carried a high risk of exposure were more likely to be tested than those who had not; 206 patients overall had undergone procedures that carried a high risk of exposure but were not subsequently tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

This study aimed at reassessing the significance of 'anti-HBc alone' in unselected sera referred to the clinical laboratory and determining whether significant HBV viraemia can be found in this setting. Of the 6431 patients tested for HBsAg, total anti-HBc and anti-HBs in a Paris hospital over a 1-year period, 362 (5.6%) had 'anti-HBc alone' (24.8% of anti-HBc-positive patients). Only 11 of the 362 sera (3.0%) were found to be false positive. One patient was in the resolving phase of acute hepatitis B. HBV-DNA was detected in 10 of 362 (2.8%) patients, using a commercial standardized assay (threshold: 350 IU/mL). Viral loads exceeded 10(4) copies/mL in 6 of 10 patients. Mutations in the HBsAg immunodominant region were identified in seven of the viraemic patients. HBsAg was detected in only two cases when retested by one of the latest, multivalent assays. Neither human immunodeficiency virus nor hepatitis C virus serostatus distinguished between patients with and without HBV-DNA. In conclusion, 'anti-HBc alone' should be considered a risk marker for a so-called 'false occult' HBV infection with significant viraemia. Indeed, results in this hospital population indicate that a small proportion of patients with 'anti-HBc alone' have high viral loads, revealing the occurrence of infection with HBV mutants that escape detection even by multivalent HBsAg assays."

The data on 1425 HIV-positive patients with recorded serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were retrospectively analysed. The estimated rate of treatment change was slightly higher in the HBsAg-positive group (0.57 per year) compared with the HBsAg-negative group (0.50 per year). Although this difference was insignificant in multivariable modelling, the confidence intervals of the estimates barely included unity. Antiretroviral drug family, calendar period, prior exposure to antiretrovirals and the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with the number of drug alterations. A slight impact of co-infection on the frequency of treatment change after the beginning of HAART cannot be excluded. However, the paucity of studies on this issue necessitates the conduct of further research."

These infants are at high risk for perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, chronic HBV infection, and associated complications of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. All vaccine advisory groups recommend that all pregnant women be routinely tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit during each pregnancy to determine whether their newborns will require immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of perinatal HBV infection. Administration of appropriate immunoprophylaxis is approximately 90% effective in preventing HBV infection among children born to HBsAg-positive mothers. In 1995, the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California (KP)--a health-maintenance organization (HMO) providing care to 2.5 million members and delivering 30,000 infants annually--implemented HBsAg screening of all pregnant women. After initiating the program, KP estimated that at least 25% of the infants born to HBsAg-positive women were not receiving appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis. In response, KP implemented a tracking and follow-up program in 1988. This report describes an assessment of the impact of this program, which indicates that a centralized case-management and tracking system can substantially improve levels of post-exposure prophylaxis."

This retrospective long-term cohort study was aimed to investigate whether coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic HBV infection. A total of 1,042 non-HCC patients were recruited and followed up for a median 4.3 years (range 1.0-22 years). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for HCC development. The prevalence of coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was 7.0% (73/1,042). In univariate analysis, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year cumulative incidences of HCC were significantly higher in coexistence group than in HBsAg only group (12.7%, 23.4%, 69.4% vs. 4.9%, 13%, 20.6%, respectively; P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs [Hazard ratio (HR), 2.001; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.023-3.912; P = 0.043] as well as male gender [HR, 1.898; 95% CI, 0.31-0.896; P = 0.018], age over 40 years [HR, 14.56; 95% CI, 4.499-47.08; P = 0.0001], and cirrhosis [HR, 7.995; 95% CI, 4.756-13.439; P = 0.0001] was identified as the independent factor for HCC development. Also, the cumulative incidence of HCC increased in proportion to the number of the risk factors. In conclusion, coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs may increase independently the risk of HCC development in chronic HBV infection. Therefore, consideration of HCC development is required in patients with coexistence of HBsAg and anti-HBs."

Current treatments rarely cure chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting the need for new anti-HBV drugs. Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) are phosphorothioated oligonucleotides that have demonstrated a great potential to inhibit infection with several viruses. In chronically infected human patients, NAPs administration lead to a decline of blood HBsAg and HBV DNA and to HBsAg seroconversion, the expected signs of functional cure. NAPs have also been shown to prevent infection of duck hepatocytes with the Avihepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and to exert an antiviral activity against established DHBV infection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the specific anti-HBV antiviral activity of NAPs in the HepaRG human hepatoma cell line and primary cultures of human hepatocytes. NAPs with different chemical features (phosphorothioation, 2'O-methyl ribose, 5-methylcytidine) were assessed for antiviral activity when provided at the time of HBV inoculation or post-inoculation. NAPs dose-dependently inhibited HBV entry in a phosphorothioation-dependent, sequence-independent and size-dependent manner. This inhibition of HBV entry by NAPs was impaired by 2'O-methyl ribose modification. NAP treatment after viral inoculation did not elicit any antiviral activity."

Response to interferon (IFN) alpha-based therapies in HIV-1 positive patients co-infected with HCV genotype 4 is poor, similar to that obtained for HCV genotype 1 and much lower than for HCV genotypes 2 and 3. The lack of sequence data related to HCV of genotype 4 prompted us to sequence the complete genome of two genotype 4 variants isolated from two HIV-1 co-infected patients (24 and 25). Our aim was to investigate the evolutionary relationships of the former variants with other genotypes and/or genotype 4 subtypes. Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis from genomic regions 5'NC, core-E1 and NS5B revealed that the variants isolated from patients 24 and 25 (both subtyped 4c/4d by INNO-LIPA II HCV) belong to subtypes 4d and 4a, respectively. When looking at the complete genome sequence one of the variants showed a new genotype 4 subtype. Interestingly, sequence length differences in the interferon sensitivity determining region coding regions were observed when compared with sequences from other genotypes. Similarly, when the catalytic efficiency of the NS3/4 protease from patients 24 and 25 samples were determined, they displayed 70.6+/-7.7 and 23.5+/-3.4%, respectively, of the activity shown by genotype 1 NS3/4 proteases. Overall, pairwise comparison and phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of the complete genome or the different protein-encoding regions showed that genotype 4 sequences were more closely related to genotype 1 sequences. The description of new HCV genome variants may help our understanding of the HCV biology as well as the role of different genotypes in HCV treatment and therapy response."

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 115 (85%) subjects were infected with subtype B viruses, 1 with a subtype F1 virus, and 20 (15%) carried BF intersubtype recombinants. Most BF recombinants grouped into two clusters, one related to CRF12_BF, while the other could represent a new circulating recombinant form (CRF). In conclusion, this is the first report analysing the prevalence of ARV resistance which includes patients under HAART from Chile. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of the PR-RT coding sequences reveals the presence of BF intersubtype recombinants."
1168,0.001,1.0000,"This study was aimed to evaluate TT virus prevalence in subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in patients affected by hepatitis of unknown origin (non-A-non-E hepatitis) and in healthy subjects who had not been exposed to HBV, HCV and HIV. A total of 317 subjects were tested; 40 were HBsAg asymptomatic carriers, 57 subjects were anti-HCV positive (45 without chronic hepatitis and 12 with HCV-related chronic hepatitis), and 27 had chronic non-A-non-E hepatitis. Fifty-seven subjects were intravenous drug users (IVDUs) (52 with HCV or/and HIV infections), seven patients underwent a liver transplant for fulminant hepatitis and 137 were healthy subjects from the general population. Overall, TTV-DNA was detected in 62 subjects (19.6%): in 17.9% of the HBsAg carriers, in 14% of the anti-HCV-positive patients (in 8.3% and in 15.5% of patients with and without chronic hepatitis, respectively), in 22.2% of non-A-non-E hepatitis patients, in 22.8% of IVDUs, in 57.1% of fulminant hepatitis patients. TTV-DNA was also found in 20.4% healthy subjects. The prevalence in the different subgroups was not statistically different. The genotypes were identified in 40 of the 62 (64.5%) TTV-DNA positive samples: genotype 1a in 17.5%, 1b in 27.5%, genotype 2 in 27.5%, genotype 3 in 15.0%, genotype 4 in 5.0% and genotype 5 in 7.5%; the genotype distribution in the subsets of patients was not significantly different. In conclusion, this study showed that TTV infection is common in Italy; it is widespread throughout the entire population and five genotypes are present in Sardinia. Our results further dismiss the role of TTV as cofactor in influencing the clinical course of infections with other hepatitis viruses as well as the role of HIV in enhancing TTV transmission and replication."
4633,0.001,1.0000,"GV-TH-01, a Phase 1 open-label trial of a DNA prime—Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost vaccine (GOVX-B11), was undertaken in HIV infected participants on antiretroviral treatment (ART) to evaluate safety and vaccine-elicited T cell responses, and explore the ability of elicited CD8+ T cells to control viral rebound during analytical treatment interruption (TI). Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/μl. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine."

We established the use of tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) for detecting IL28B rs8099917 genotype (T>G) in 56 Chinese chronic hepatitis C patients infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1. The new assay showed 98.2% specificity, and was confirmed by direct sequencing. Among the 56 samples, TT genotype and TG genotype accounted for 80.4% (45/56) and 19.6% (11/56), respectively. GG genotype was not found. The proportion of responders in TT group was higher than that in TG group (68.9% vs. 27.3%, p=0.029). For HCV clinical decision-making, using the new assay, rs8099917 genotyping could provide similar information to rs12979860 genotyping due to a strong association between the two SNPs in Chinese patients. The assay system in this study can be implemented using basic laboratory equipments, making it convenient for clinical and research purposes."
3716,0.001,1.0000,"In this study we have evaluated the concordance between serology, using five commercially available antibody assays designed to discriminate between HIV-1 and HIV-2, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual infection. Thirty-seven HIV-1 and HIV-2 dually reactive serum samples from individuals in Guinea-Bissau with total CD4+ T lymphocyte counts ranging from 9 to 948 x 10(6)/liter were included in the study. All samples were tested by Multispot, Pepti-LAV, and Immunocomb HIV-1 and HIV-2 discriminatory antibody assays. Thirty-two of the 37 samples were also tested by a combination of two HIV type-specific antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; Wellcozyme HIV-1 and Murex HIV-2). Each sample showed dual reactivity in all or any of these assays. A nested PCR based on primer systems in the vif and pol regions of HIV-1 and in the gag and LTR regions of HIV-2 was used to evaluate the serological results. Thirty samples from HIV-1 antibody-positive individuals and 30 samples from HIV-2 antibody-positive individuals were all PCR positive with their corresponding primer systems. The type specificity was 100% for all of the primer systems. The concordance between dual HIV-1 and HIV-2 reactivity on the serological assays and PCR was 77.7% for Multispot, 80% for Pepti-LAV, 81.8% for Immunocomb, and 85.7% for the two ELISAs used in combination. Thus the majority of individuals included in this study appeared to be truly dually infected. The study shows that it is possible, through a careful selection of assays, to reach a high concordance between serological assays and PCR in studying HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual infections."
9612,0.001,1.0000,"Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In screening of chemical libraries, we found 6-azido-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AzBBU) and 6-amino-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AmBBU) to be highly active and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in vitro. To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with escalating concentrations of each compound. After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were obtained, and they were more than 500-fold resistant to the uracil derivatives compared to the wild type. Sequence analysis was conducted for RT of the escape viruses at passages 12 and 24. The amino acid mutation Y181C in the polymerase domain of RT was detected for all escape viruses. Docking studies using the crystal structure of RT showed that AmBBU requires the amino acid residues Leu100, Val106, Tyr181, and Trp229 for exerting its inhibitory effect on HIV-1. Four additional amino acid changes (K451R, R461K, T468P, and D471N) were identified in the RNase H domain of RT; however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still unclear. In conclusion, the initial mutation Y181C seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the uracil derivatives AzBBU and AmBBU. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each mutation in the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance."
5312,0.001,1.0000,"We report detailed quantitative analysis of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) p24 and HIV-1 RNA in tonsil biopsies from 13 patients with early, asymptomatic HIV infection before and during combination antiretroviral therapy. Using fluorescent microscopy in conjunction with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of frozen tissue sections, we show that plasma and tissue viral loads decreased by approximately 3 logs during the 1-year treatment period, with good correlation between the HIV-1 p24 and HIV-1 RNA response in tissue. The decrease of tissue viral load was delayed compared to plasma viral load, possibly explained by the observation that the amount of follicular dendritic cell-associated virus correlated best with the area under the curve of plasma HIV-1 RNA throughout the last 12 weeks. Before and during treatment, the relative proportions of HIV-1 on follicular dendritic cells and within mononuclear cells remained constant, suggesting similar decay characteristics in these two lymphoid tissue compartments. However, viral p24 or RNA remained almost always detectable in tissue despite full suppression of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, and increased even after short-term rebounds in plasma viral load. Thus, full and sustained suppression of viral replication was required to efficiently decrease viral load in lymphoid tissue, but complete abolition of residual viral replication was not achieved."
3397,0.001,1.0000,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."
555,0.001,1.0000,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."
5344,0.001,1.0000,"CD4+ T lymphocytes are the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but there is increasing evidence that other immune cells in the blood, including CD8+ T lymphocytes and monocytes, are also productively infected. The extent to which these additional cellular reservoirs contribute to ongoing immunodeficiency and viral persistence during therapy remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of HIV-1 diversity and genetic structure in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes of 13 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Analysis of molecular variance and nonparametric tests performed on HIV-1 envelope sequences provided statistically significant evidence of viral compartmentalization in different leukocyte populations. Signature pattern analysis and predictions of coreceptor use provided no evidence that selection arising from viral tropism was responsible for the genetic structure observed. Analysis of viral genetic variation in different leukocyte populations demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. In the absence of evidence for leukocyte-specific selection, these features were supportive of a metapopulation model of HIV-1 replication as described previously among HIV-1 populations in the spleen. Compartmentalization of the virus in different leukocytes may have significant implications for current models of HIV-1 population genetics and contribute to the highly variable way in which drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."
648,0.001,1.0000,"Combinations of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus a third agent represent the current standard for antiretroviral therapy. Stavudine is a nucleoside analogue that demonstrates in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 within an acceptable therapeutic index in a range of T lymphocyte and haematopoietic precursor cell lines. It is additive or synergistic in vitro with a number of other antiretrovirals including protease inhibitors in two and three way combinations and is active against zidovudine-resistant virus. It exhibits excellent oral bioavailability, with CSF penetration. In clinical use, stavudine exhibits antiretroviral activity as a monotherapy similar to zidovudine, and is of proven clinical benefit in zidovudine-pretreated patients. In combination with didanosine and/or nelfinavir it results in more substantial and durable responses in immunological and virological markers than reported with either drug alone. Comparative trials in zidovudine-experienced patients suggest a similar frequency of adverse events to that observed with zidovudine. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common dose-limiting toxicity with haematological and hepatic function disturbance being infrequent. Reasons for stavudine failure are not established, with no consistent genotypic pattern being associated with changes in stavudine sensitivity in vitro or in vivo. The role of stavudine is as a component of triple therapy regimens both in initial therapy and in patients with prior zidovudine experience."
4491,0.001,1.0000,"The naphthyridinone GSK364735 potently inhibited recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in a strand transfer assay (mean 50% inhibitory concentration +/- standard deviation, 8 +/- 2 nM). As expected based on the structure of the drug, it bound competitively with another two-metal binding inhibitor (Kd [binding constant], 6 +/- 4 nM). In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase."
1980,0.001,1.0000,"CD14, originally recognized as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, has recently been implicated in the process of T-cell suppression and apoptosis. Its soluble form has been shown to bind, in vitro, to human T cells, a process that may carry a negative signal onto these cells. We recently described a novel lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood, a population that expresses an intracellular CD14-like antigen. This novel T-cell population, composed mainly of CD8 cells and of very few CD4 cells, was found to be greatly enhanced in asymptomatic, untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. In the present study, we further characterized this cell population and found that it differed from other CD8 subpopulations associated with HIV infection such as CD8/CD38. In addition, we followed HIV patients under conditions of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and observed two groups of patients: patients in whom the CD14-like positive-testing T cells returned to normal within 1 to 3 months, and patients in whom it did not, in spite of a significant plasma HIV-RNA viral load decrease. Thus, this new CD14-like positive-testing lymphocyte population may represent an interesting and important component of the cellular events associated with HIV infection. On the basis of its modulation following HAART, we speculate that it may be used, in the future, as a drug-monitoring cellular marker in antiretroviral treatment."

The efficacy of an additional booster dose in children with immune recovery on HAART remains unknown. This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response. HIV-infected children with immune recovery after HAART are likely to benefit from three-dose HBV re-vaccination."

Overall, 69% reported having been vaccinated for HAV and 70% reported having been vaccinated for HBV. Multivariate models were used to identify predictors of HAV and HBV vaccination, and younger men, HIV-positive men, and men who had access to a doctor or clinic were more likely to be vaccinated than older men, HIV-negative men, and men without access to a doctor or clinic. Men with health insurance coverage were more likely to have received HBV vaccination than men without coverage.

4958,0.001,1.0000,"The report describes an HIV/AIDS patient seen at a referral center in Mexico City, in whom a mycobacterial infection in the oral mucosa, probably tuberculosis (TB) was identified. The purpose is to describe the clinical and histological findings in an HIV-infected patient, who after being treated successfully for tuberculous lymphangitis 4 years ago, presented with a lingual ulcer as the only suggestive sign of recurrence of mycobacterial infection, probably M. tuberculosis. A 39-year-old man seen in the HIV clinic of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición ""Salvador Zubirán"" in Mexico City since 1991 for HIV infection. In 1999 the patient developed tuberculous lymphangitis; he was managed with a 4-drug regimen for 12 months, with improvement of local and systemic symptoms. In May of 2003, the patient presented a painful superficial lingual ulcer, 0.7 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, crateriform with slightly elevated, irregular and indurated borders, of 4 months duration. The histopathological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with giant multinucleated cells, suggestive of mycobacterial infection, and recurrence of TB was considered. Rifampin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were administered. The lingual lesion improved with partial healing at the first week and total remission at 45 days after the beginning of the antituberculous treatment. In June, 2003, the patient began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that included two NRTIs and one NNRTI. At 7 months of follow-up, the patient remains free of lingual lesions. The particularity of the present case is that the lingual ulcer was the only sign of infection by mycobacteria, suggestive of TB, in an HIV/AIDS patient that probably represented a recurrence of a previous episode."

The cohort studied was representative for i.v. drug users of the Zurich street scene including occasional users, weekend users and severe drug addicts. 56% of the drug users tested showed HBV markers. 21% had an ongoing infection. 32% were naturally HBV immune and 4% showed immunity due to vaccination. HAV markers were detected in 50% of the individuals tested, with an ongoing infection present in 8%. 48% of the individuals tested showed signs of HCV contact. 15% of the i.v. drug users were HIV infected. 22% of these individuals were HIV-antigen positive. The data confirm that i.v. drug users have the highest rates of infection within the total population. The prevalence of viral markers correlated positively with the duration and intensity of i.v. drug use and with the practice of needle sharing. In comparison to comparable earlier studies, the present viral prevalence data were lower. This is thought to be due to an Aids prevention campaign undertaken in the Zurich street drug scene, including free distribution of injection material and condoms."

The absolute numbers of iNKT cells were significantly decreased in TB patients and in HIV-1+ individuals who were antiretroviral therapy naive or had detectable viremia despite receiving HAART. iNKT cell subset analysis demonstrated a decreased percentage of CD4(+) iNKT cells in HIV-1+ subjects, and a decreased percentage of double negative iNKT cells in TB patients. Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients. These findings indicate that peripheral blood iNKT cells in these two chronic infections show an up-regulated expression of activation markers, suggesting their role in the immune response to infection."

Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."
9219,0.001,1.0000,"Sequence variation in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of HIV-1 was analyzed in viral isolates of 17 infected individuals. Two classes of LTR size variants were found. One HIV-1 variant was detected containing an additional binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. Another LTR size variation was observed in four patients in a region just upstream of the NF-kappa B enhancer. This variation was the result of a duplication of a short DNA sequence (CTG-motif). Cell culture experiments demonstrated that the natural variant with four Sp1 sites had a slightly higher promoter activity and viral replication rate than the isogenic control LTR with three Sp1 sites. No positive effect of the duplicated CTG-motif could be detected. In order to measure small differences in virus production more accurately, equal amounts of a size variant and the wild-type plasmid were cotransfected into T-cells. The virus with four Sp1 sites did outgrow the three Sp1 virus in 35 days of culture and CTG-monomer virus outcompeted the CTG-dimer virus in 42 days. Based on these results we estimate a 5-10% difference in virus production of the LTR variants when compared to that of wild-type."
7208,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat protein has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced."
3492,0.001,1.0000,"HLA antigens, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated antigens and lymphocyte subsets in liver tissue from 35 patients with HBs antigenemia were studied using an immunoperoxidase double staining method and immunoelectron microscopy in order to clarify the immune mechanism of hepatocyte lysis in type B hepatitis. Immune light and electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte subsets revealed that infiltrating lymphocytes in the areas of piecemeal necrosis and focal necrosis were predominantly CD8-positive, showing direct contact with hepatocytes. In contrast, CD4(+) cells were infrequently observed in necrotizing inflammatory lesions. HLA-A,B,C antigens were mainly found on hepatocytes in areas of piecemeal necrosis and focal necrosis, in association with CD8(+) lymphocyte infiltration. HLA-DR antigens were demonstrated on a few hepatocytes in the same lesions. In cases of CAH with serum HBeAg positive, HLA-A,B,C, antigens and HBV antigens simultaneously demonstrated on the same hepatocytes. Especially, hepatocytes expressing both HLA-A,B,C antigen and HBsAg on the plasma membrane showed direct contact with CD8(+)lymphocytes. This finding fulfilled the morphological requirements for HBsAg as a target antigen. On the other hand, HBcAg was hardly demonstrated in the liver cell membrane but was demonstrated mainly in the cytoplasm. Compared with the nuclear localization of HBcAg in cases of NSR, cytoplasmic localization of this antigen may be associated with membranous expression of new antigens induced by HBV infection."
292,0.001,1.0000,"Study of the mechanism of transmission of hepatitis B virus is important for public health. An improved experimental model is described for studying vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) via human spermatozoa. Recombinant plasmid pIRES2-EGFP-HBx which would express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) used as a marker for the expression of hepatitis B virus X (HBx) gene was constructed successfully and confirmed by PCR, EcoR I and Sal I digestion, and DNA sequencing. After exposure to the plasmid, human spermatozoa were used to fertilize zona-free hamster ova in vitro. Two-cell embryos were collected and classified into group A with green fluorescence and group B without green fluorescence under fluorescence microscope. The results showed that HBx DNA positive bands were detected in the embryos with green fluorescence (PCR and RT-PCR) and positive controls (PCR) indicating presence and expression of HBx gene. In contrast, HBx gene expression was not detected in the embryos without green fluorescence and negative controls (PCR and RT-PCR). This improved experimental model is more efficient, accurate and reliable for studying further perinatal transmission of HBV or other viruses causing chronic human disease possibly via the male germ line."

EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) was detected in 43 of 68 cases (63%) of peripheral T-cell lymphoma: in 100% (11 of 11 cases) of NK/T-cell lymphomas, 70% (14 of 20 cases) of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AILT) and 49% (18 of 37 cases) of other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A positive band was also detected at high incidence (36 of 65 cases; 55%) in a PCR analysis using primers to detect the Bam HI-W fragment of EBV. In the immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody to latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) of EBV, one of the EBV-encoded latent gene products, LMP-1, was found to be expressed in 13 of 64 cases (20%), but EBNA-2 was not expressed in all the cases examined (0 of 59 cases; 0%). The 5-yr survival rate was 28% for peripheral T-cell lymphomas overall, 0% for NK/T-cell lymphomas, 38% for AILTs and 28% for other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The difference in the overall survival rate between NK/T-cell lymphoma and non-NK/T-cell lymphoma was significant (P = 0.0498 by Log-rank test). Among peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients overall, the group severely infected with EBV (EBER-ISH ++) had a lower 5-yr survival rate (8%) than the group slightly (EBER-ISH +) or not infected (38%; P = 0.0013)."
2472,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of human T-cell leukaemia virus-I and -II infection was studied in a cohort of 346 intravenous and nonintravenous drug users in Amsterdam. Three participants (0.86%) had antibodies to HTLV-I by two commercially available HTLV-I enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Infection in these three subjects was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In the immunoblot study, only two of the three subjects were considered positive, since the serum of the third subject had antibodies to p24 only. By means of the polymerase chain reaction two participants (male intravenous drug users infected with human immunodeficiency virus; HIV) appeared to be infected with HTLV-I and one subject (a male nonintravenous drug user from Surinam) with HTLV-II. It is concluded that HTLV-I and HTLV-II circulate sporadically among drug users in Amsterdam and that risky injecting behaviour, which led to an HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users, has not led so far to an appreciable transmission of the other retroviruses among this group."
7851,0.001,1.0000,"A 33-year-old Hispanic woman with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of 2, viral load of 730,000 copies/mL, candidal esophagitis, seizure disorder, a history of bacterial pneumonia, and recent weight loss was admitted with tonic clonic seizure. On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."
4427,0.001,1.0000,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the lung is an important niche for the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may have implications for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The lung itself is a major site for the opportunistic infections associated with the progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), specifically Pneumocystis carinii, Myobacterium tuberculosis and pyogenic bacteria. These cases of active pulmonary complications are direct indicators of enhanced progression to AIDS-defining illness and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore essential that the interaction between the lung and HIV is fully understood. Recent research indicates the lung may be a major sanctuary for the virus, with distinct evolution and replication in contrast to other target organs for HIV. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings of HIV infection, evolution, host factors involved in the control of HIV within the lung and the impact this may have on current therapy."
6997,0.001,1.0000,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 149 base-pair region of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) genome and a 551 base-pair region of the HIV-1 proviral long terminal repeat (LTR) present in DNA extracted from post-mortem tissue. Multiple tissues (n = 116) obtained from 16 patients which were subjected to PCR were also subjected to cell culture and histopathological analyses. One hundred and seven samples (92%) contained CMV DNA and 66/116 (57%) contained HIV proviral DNA at a level of > or = 10 genomes. Both viruses were detected in 60/116 (51.7%) of samples, with co-infection most frequent in the lung (69%). Cell culture for CMV detected 9.3% of the PCR-positive samples, whilst histology identified CMV inclusions in 15.9% of samples, all of which were CMV PCR-positive. CMV was most frequently detected in adrenal and lung tissues by histology. These results show that co-infection with CMV and HIV is a common occurrence in organs from AIDS patients and provide further evidence for a role of cytomegalovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
3408,0.001,1.0000,"Recent reports have suggested a possible association between HIV-1 infection and primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), but most of the patients described to date have either had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) with concurrent lung infections or have administered Factor VIII intravenously for hemophilia. We report three human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive homosexual white males with clinical and hemodynamic diagnoses of PPH. None of the patients had any opportunistic lung infections or other pulmonary pathology, nor were they hemophiliacs. They had no histories of intravenous drug use. Lung tissue from two of the patients revealed hypertensive arteriopathy consistent with PPH and no other pulmonary pathology. Attempts at localizing HIV-1 infection to the vascular endothelium with electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, DNA in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction techniques did not reveal direct pulmonary artery infection with the virus. These data and the finding of tubuloreticular structures on electron microscopy suggest that HIV-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases of PPH through mediator release associated with HIV-1 infection rather than by direct endothelial infection."
1612,0.001,1.0000,"Pulmonary aspergillosis has recently been described as an emerging infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but the pathological changes have not been well documented. In this autopsy study, 17 cases of AIDS-related pulmonary aspergillosis were identified from the files of two institutions. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions, the entire spectrum of pulmonary aspergillosis was represented. Thirteen patients exhibited acute invasive aspergillosis, and seven patients had evidence of subacute or chronic invasive infection, four of whom also had areas of acute invasion. One patient had necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis as well as acute invasive infection, and one individual had saprophytic colonization of a cavity caused by previous Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) without evidence of invasive aspergillosis. The same conditions known to predispose immunocompromised individuals without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were also identified in these patients with AIDS and included neutropenia, steroid therapy, and underlying lung disease. Additional pulmonary conditions were identified in all but one case and consisted mainly of infection or some form of chronic lung disease. In particular, half of the cases were associated with pulmonary fibrosis related to prior PCP. All cases occurred in or after 1990, confirming the perception of the recent emergence of aspergillosis in AIDS. As suggested by this study, one reason for this may be that patients with AIDS are now living long enough to develop one or more of the predisposing conditions for pulmonary aspergillosis."
6088,0.001,1.0000,"Drug toxicity and viral resistance limit the long-term efficacy of antiviral drug treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Thus, alternative therapies need to be explored. We tested the infusion of T lymphocytes transduced with a retroviral vector (M87o) that expresses an HIV entry-inhibitory peptide (maC46). Gene-modified autologous T cells were infused into ten HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus during anti-retroviral combination therapy. T-cell infusions were tolerated well, with no severe side effects. A significant increase of CD4 counts was observed after infusion. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, the CD4 counts of all patients were still around or above baseline. Gene-modified cells could be detected in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow throughout the 1-year follow-up, and marking levels correlated with the cell dose. No significant changes of viral load were observed during the first 4 months. Four of the seven patients who changed their antiviral drug regimen thereafter responded with a significant decline in plasma viral load. In conclusion, the transfer of gene-modified cells was safe, led to sustained levels of gene marking, and may improve immune competence in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and multidrug-resistant virus."
6763,0.001,1.0000,"The increased risk of developing lung diseases in cigarette smokers has been well recognized. The association between smoking and the risk of developing pulmonary infections in HIV-1-infected patients, however, which has not been established, was evaluated in the present study. Twenty-seven cases with lower respiratory infections (15 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), 12 TB cases) were compared with 27 age, gender, socio-economic and HIV status-matched patients, without history of respiratory diseases. Medical history and physical examinations were obtained every 6 months. Blood was drawn for CD4 and viral load measurements. A substantial number of HIV + smokers who developed PCP (one-third) had been on highly active retroviral therapy (HAART) for more than 6 months and prophylaxis had been discontinued. Multivariate analyses indicated that in HIV-infected people, after controlling for HIV status and antiretrovirals, cigarette smoking doubled the risk for developing PCP (p = 0.01). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that long-term smoking also increased the risk (2 x) of developing tuberculosis (p = 0.04). Moreover, daily tobacco use seemed to attenuate by 40% the immune and virological response to antiretroviral therapies. These findings indicate that tobacco use significantly increases the risk of pulmonary diseases in HIV infected subjects and has a potential deleterious impact on antiretroviral treatment."
5262,0.001,1.0000,"Pulmonary histopathological and clinical changes associated with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were found to be less severe in 10 HIV-positive patients (group A) with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in 8 patients (group B) with other immune deficiencies. Lung biopsies from group A showed minimal thickening of the alveolar walls from oedema and slight mononuclear cell infiltration, while in group B alveolar wall thickening was more prominent with distinct mononuclear cell infiltration and evidence of diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial fibrosis. Infection with P. carinii cysts was heavy in 60%, moderate in 30% and mild in 10% in group A patients v. heavy in 0%, moderate in 14% and mild in 86% in group B patients. These findings appear to suggest that AIDS/PCP presents with a heavy parasite load but only minimal histopathological changes that are reversible and that atypical change as observed in PCP in other immune deficiencies are caused by previous or concomitant insults other than pneumocystosis. Milder propagation of P. carinii in HIV-negative patients may be because there is a lack of undamaged type I pneumocytes to which trophozoites probably need to be attached at a certain developmental stage."
7789,0.001,1.0000,"We obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 45 Malawian adults, to measure the concentrations of innate pulmonary immune factors that are important in lung defense against infection. Increased concentrations of the beta -chemokine RANTES were found in BAL fluid from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected subjects, compared with those in BAL fluid from the HIV-1-uninfected control subjects (mean, 86 pg/mL vs. 0 pg/mL; P<.001). Lysozyme concentrations were also elevated in the HIV-1-infected subjects, compared with those in the HIV-1-uninfected control subjects (1.9 mu g/mL vs. 1.1 mu g/mL; P=.03), but were not elevated in the HIV-1-infected subjects who had recently recovered from invasive pneumococcal disease. Concentrations of lactoferrin and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) were not different when the subjects were compared by HIV-1 serostatus. Concentrations of RANTES (R2=0.68 and P<.0001) and SLPI (R2=0.29 and P=.001) correlated with BAL fluid HIV-1 load but not with plasma HIV-1 load."
1738,0.001,1.0000,"Several epidemiological studies have suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the presence of obstructive lung disease (OLD). However, there is a strong link between HCV infection and tobacco abuse, a major risk factor for the development of OLD. In this study we analyzed clinical, laboratory and spirometric data from 1068 study participants to assess whether HCV infection, viremia, or HCV-associated end organ damage were associated with OLD. Demographics, risk behavior, serologic status for HCV and HIV, and spirometric measurements were collected from a cross-sectional analysis of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study, an observational cohort of IDUs followed in Baltimore, MD since 1988. Of 1,068 participants, 890 (83%) were HCV positive and 174 (16%) met spirometric criteria for OLD. Factors independently associated with OLD were age and BMI. HCV infection, viral load and HCV-associated end organ damage were similar in participants with and without OLD. In summary, there was no independent association between markers of HCV exposure, chronicity, viremia, or HCV-associated end-organ damage with OLD. Our findings support the strong correlation between HCV status, injection drug use, and smoking. These data suggest that HCV may not be a sole contributor to the increased prevalence of OLD described in previous studies of HCV-infected individuals."
7555,0.001,1.0000,"The conserved membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 is a target of two broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, and is an important lead for vaccine design. However, immunogens that bear MPER epitopes so far have not elicited neutralizing antibodies in laboratory animals. One explanation is that the immunogens fail to recreate the proper molecular environment in which the epitopes of 2F5 and 4E10 are presented on the virus. To explore this molecular environment, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis across residues 660 to 680 in the MPER of a pseudotyped variant of HIV-1(JR-FL), designated HIV-1(JR2), and examined the ability of 2F5 and 4E10 to neutralize the Ala mutant viruses. The results show that the only changes to produce neutralization resistance to 2F5 occurred in residue D, K, or W of the core epitope (LELDKWANL). Likewise, 4E10 resistance arose by replacing one of three residues; two (W and F) were in the core epitope, and one (W) was seven residues C-terminal to these two (NWFDISNWLW). Importantly, no single substitution resulted in resistance of virus to both 2F5 and 4E10. Surprisingly, 8 out of 21 MPER Ala mutants were more sensitive than the parental pseudovirus to 2F5 and/or 4E10. At most, only small differences in neutralization sensitivity to anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody b12 and peptide T20 were observed with the MPER Ala mutant pseudoviruses. These data suggest that MPER substitutions can act locally and enhance the neutralizing activity of antibodies to this region and imply a distinct role of the MPER of gp41 during HIV-1 envelope-mediated fusion. Neutralization experiments showing synergy between and T20 and 4E10 against HIV-1 are also presented. The data presented may aid in the design of antigens that better present the MPER of gp41 to the immune system."
4511,0.001,1.0000,"The evolutionary rate of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is considered to be very low, in strong contrast to the related human retrovirus HIV. However, current estimates of the HTLV-1 rate rely on the anthropological calibration of phylogenies using assumed dates of human migration events. To obtain an independent rate estimate, we analyzed two variable regions of the HTLV-1 genome (LTR and env) from eight infected families. Remarkable genetic stability was observed, as only two mutations in LTR (756 bp) and three mutations in env (522 bp) occurred within the 16 vertical transmission chains, including one ambiguous position in each region. The evolutionary rate in HTLV-1 was then calculated using a maximum-likelihood approach that used the highest and lowest possible times of HTLV-1 shared ancestry, given the known transmission histories. The rates for the LTR and env regions were 9.58 x 10(-8)-1.25 x 10(-5) and 7.84 x 10(-7) -2.33 x 10(-5)nucleotide substitutions per site per year, respectively. A more precise estimate was obtained for the combined LTR-env data set, which was 7.06 x 10(-7)-1.38 x 10(-5)substitutions per site per year. We also note an interesting correlation between the occurrence of mutations in HTLV-1 and the age of the individual infected."
6440,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatic steatosis (HS) is frequent in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, occurring in 40%-80%, associating with metabolic and virus-related factors, namely, genotype 3 and viral load. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral treatment seem to be risk factors for HS. Several studies addressed this issue in coinfected patients, with discrepant results. A meta-analysis was performed on the HS risk factors in coinfected patients. Eligible studies were identified through structured keywords including coinfection, HCV, HIV, and steatosis in relevant databases including PubMed. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence limits (CIs) were obtained with the random-effects model and the DerSimonian-Laird method. Twelve studies, including 1,989 coinfected patients, were selected. Twenty percent were infected with HCV genotype 3. The overall prevalence of HS was 50.8% (23%-72%). Four studies also included 1,540 HCV monoinfected patients, not showing an increased risk for HS in coinfected patients (OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.84-3.10, P = 0.151). In coinfected patients, HS was associated with higher body mass index (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.19, P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.32-4.07, P = 0.003), elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.61, P = 0.035), necroinflammatory activity (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.11-2.67, P = 0.016), and fibrosis (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.34, P = 0.003). No associations were found between HS and gender, other metabolic factors (dyslipidemia, glucose, metabolic syndrome), HCV-related factors (genotype, viral load), or HIV-related factors (viral load, CD4 count, antiretroviral therapy, and class of medication)."
4342,0.001,1.0000,"The reported incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has ranged from 0.25 to 0.96% in clinical studies, but up to 17% at autopsy. A preliminary analysis at our hospital suggested that the frequency of VTE among HIV-positive individuals might be higher than previously reported. To further evaluate this issue, we performed a retrospective study of patients with a diagnosis of VTE and/or HIV infection discharged from our hospital between July 1, 1998 and June 30, 1999. A total of 13,496 patients were discharged during the year of the study. There were 244 patients with VTE and 362 who were HIV-positive. Ten of the 244 patients with VTE were HIV-positive (4.1%). The frequency of VTE among HIV-positive individuals was 10/362 (2.8%) compared to 234/13134 (1.8%) in the non-HIV-positive group, but the difference is not statistically significant. However, in patients under age 50, the frequencies were significantly different: 10/302 (3.31%) versus 35/6594 (0.53%), respectively (p < 0.0001). The frequency of VTE in HIV-positive patients less than 50 years old (3.31%) was greater than in HIV-positive patients over 50 years of age (0/60), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. In contrast, in the non-HIV-positive group, VTE was significantly more frequent in those 50 and older compared to younger patients (3.04% versus 0.53%, p = 0.0001). Statistical analysis indicated that the direction of association between age and diagnosis of VTE differed for HIV-positive patients versus non-HIV-positive patients. Our results suggest that HIV-positive patients under age 50 are at increased risk for VTE compared with non-HIV-positive individuals."
3550,0.001,1.0000,"Reduced bone mass measurements are often found in HIV-infected youths. Both in vitro and human studies demonstrated a role of antiretroviral treatment in determining bone mass alteration. Nevertheless, the data regarding the responsibility of different antiretroviral drugs on bone health in children and adolescents are highly controversial. The purpose of the current study was to relate antiretroviral treatment to bone mass measurements in a large cohort of HIV-infected children and adolescents. Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured in 86 HIV-infected youths (aged 4.8-22.1 years), and in 194 healthy controls (aged 4.9-21.9 years). Fifteen patients were naive to antiretroviral treatment, 11 were receiving a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTIs) combination, 32 a protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral treatment, and 28 a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTIs)-based regimen. Comparisons between healthy and HIV-infected children and adolescents have been performed by multiple regression analyses to correct for differences in age, sex, and anthropometric measurements. Patients receiving a PI-based treatment had lumbar spine and whole body BMC values significantly lower than healthy children (P<0.05). BMC measurements of patients on other therapeutic regimens or naive to antiretroviral treatment did not differ significantly from those of healthy children. Among patients receiving a PI-based regimen, those receiving full dose Ritonavir had significantly lower lumbar spine BMC values compared to other patients. Lumbar spine and whole body BMC measurements of patients receiving a Stavudine-containing regimen were lower compared to healthy controls, naive patients, and patients on other antiretroviral regimens. Multivariate analyses showed that patients receiving both Stavudine and full dose Ritonavir had significantly lower BMC values both at the lumbar spine (P=0.0033), and in the whole skeleton (P=0.05). In conclusion, antiretroviral treatment may have a detrimental effect on bone health of HIV-infected youths: the use of Ritonavir full dose alone or in combination with Stavudine is associated to lower bone mass measurements. The use of antiretroviral regimens including these drugs should thus be monitored closely in HIV-infected youths."
8947,0.001,1.0000,"The HIV susceptibility and resistance alleles in the HLA genes were determined by investigating the distribution characteristics of the HLA alleles (A, B, and DRB1) in HIV-infected individuals of the Han population in Hubei, and by comparing these alleles with HIV-negative individuals from the same area. A cohort of 424 HIV-1 infected individuals were chosen as study subjects, and 836 HIV-negative healthy subjects from the same area served as the control population. HLA-A, B, and DRB1 allele typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) techniques. Arlequin ver3.0 was used to analyze the allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, B, and DRB 1, whereas Epi Info 7 and SPSS18.0 was used to analyze the differences in the HLA alleles between the HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative groups. A*02:03, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 alleles and their haplotypes as well as the HLA_Bw4-Bw6 hybrid showed a protective effect on HIV-1 infection. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age and sex, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that B*15:02G, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 subtypes were the resistance genes of HIV-1 infection, while B*13:01 might increase susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The correlation between A*02:06 and B*15:01G subtypes and HIV-1 susceptibility was independent of the age and sex of the host. This study demonstrated the influence of genetic factors in humans such as HLA polymorphism on individuals to resist HIV-1 infection. Association studies of HLA polymorphism, susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection, and hosts' genetic background are of significant importance for research on HIV-1 pathogenesis and vaccine design."
4094,0.001,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were to build a population pharmacokinetic model that describe plasma concentrations of indinavir in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with sustained virological response under a stable antiretroviral combination, and to characterize the effect of covariates and co-medications on indinavir pharmacokinetics. Data were obtained from 45 patients who received different dosages of indinavir: either indinavir alone t.i.d. (mostly 800 mg), either indinavir b.i.d. (mostly 800 mg) with a booster dose of 100 mg of ritonavir. Patients were required to have a baseline plasma HIV RNA <200 copies/mL and to have unchanged antiretroviral treatment for 6 months. Indinavir concentrations were measured at a first visit (one sample before drug administration and five after) and at a second visit 3 months later (before and 1 or 3 h after drug administration). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination best described indinavir pharmacokinetics. For patients treated with indinavir alone, absorption rate constant was estimated to be 0.43/h, and oral clearance Cl/F was 33 L/h. For patients treated with indinavir plus ritonavir these estimates were 0.25/h and 19 L/h, respectively. Cl/F was found to increase by 1.45-fold in men and by 1.18-fold in patients also receiving zidovudine. Oral volume of distribution (V/F) was 24 L. The inter-individual and intra-individual variability were 117 and 205% for V/F, 42 and 58% for Cl/F, respectively. This population analysis in patients with sustained virological response, quantified the effect of ritonavir on the absorption rate constant and on the clearance of indinavir, showed an increase of Cl/F in men and can be used to draw reference curve for therapeutic drug monitoring."
3586,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus antigen (HIV-ag) was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in HIV-antibody (anti-HIV) positive as well as pre-anti-HIV seroconversion sera and the results analysed according to stage of infection, risk group, age and geographic origin. Eleven (19%) of 58 homosexual men tested showed HIV-ag in a serum taken 3-4 months before or one at the time of anti-HIV seroconversion. In another eight (14%) HIV-ag persisted after seroconversion and half of them developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) in contrast to none of the other 50 anti-HIV seroconversions. Two (13%) of 16 haemophiliacs tested had HIV-ag only in the first anti-HIV seropositive sample. HIV-ag was present in 86% (30/35) of Dutch homosexual men with AIDS, in 32% (7/22) of men with ARC and in 17% (24/145) of men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) or without symptoms. Three percent (2/60) of sera of asymptomatic i.v. drug users from Amsterdam were HIV-ag positive. Ten percent (1 of 10) of sera from Central Africans with 'Slim Disease' were HIV-ag positive. Among infected children from the USA or Europe 89-100% (8/9 and 2/2) of AIDS cases, 67-100% (6/9 and 3/3) of children with ARC and 75% (3/4) of asymptomatic children were HIV-ag positive. The HIV-ag EIA appears to be able to identify HIV infection earlier than the available anti-HIV assays in a significant number of cases. Since persistence of HIV-ag, except possibly in African cases, is strongly associated with clinical deterioration, HIV-ag appears to be a suitable marker for, independent of their clinical status, selecting individuals for antiviral therapy and also for monitoring the efficiency of such therapy."
2430,0.001,1.0000,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
1778,0.001,1.0000,"The CAG polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene has been shown associated with the development of human male hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the shorter AR alleles conferring a higher risk. However, the significance of AR-CAG repeats in female hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be addressed. In this study, seventy-six pairs of female HCCs and corresponding nontumorous tissues were collected, and 180 cirrhotic nodules were microdissected from 7 cirrhotic livers. The clonality status, functional AR alleles, and CAG repeat number of each sample were determined by AR methylation analysis. In a total of 44 monoclonal HCCs, the mean of CAG repeats in the active alleles was significantly longer than that in the inactive alleles (22.0 +/- 2.8 versus 20.7 +/- 3.6; P = 0.047). When we divided HCCs into hepatitis B virus-positive [HBV(+)] and HBV(-) subgroups, the long AR allele dominance was found only in HBV(+) ones (P = 0.006 versus P = 0.923). Notably, the preference of long CAG repeat has also been found in the 100 monoclonal nodules (P = 0.013). For comparison of monoclonal nodules obtained from the same individual, a dominant long AR allele was found in 6 patients. The proportion of monoclonal cirrhotic nodules and HCCs expressing longer AR allele, 69 and 68%, are both significantly higher than 50%, the assumed value in normal liver (P < 0.001 for cirrhotic nodules and P = 0.005 for HCC). The dominance is again only prominent in HBV-infected HCCs [85% for HBV(+) HCC; P < 0.001 but 54% for HBV(-) HCC; P = 0.27]. The results indicated that in female hepatocarcinogenesis, hepatocytes expressing the longer AR allele seem to be favorably selected for autonomous growth and transformation, especially in synergy with HBV infection."
4502,0.001,1.0000,"Persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may have protean clinical manifestations. These characteristics have not been described for adult patients in Jamaica. This study was conducted to determine the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult and adolescent persons newly diagnosed with HIV presenting at a specialized clinic for sexually transmitted infections (STI). A retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult and adolescent patients newly diagnosed with HIV was undertaken over a 12-month period. The results showed that most patients (64%) were between 20 and 39 years old (age range 14-68 years, M:F ratio 1.4:1). Heterosexual practice was admitted to by 77% of patients. At the time of presentation most patients (53%) were asymptomatic while 24% had some symptoms and 21% had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The most common presentation was generalized lymphadenopathy (67%) which was significantly higher than skin rash (27%), oral candidiasis (24%), cough (24%), weight loss (24%) and pallor of mucous membranes (19%, p < 0.001). This study affirms that young people account for the majority of new cases of HIV infection. The heterosexual route was the predominant mode of transmission. Generalized lymphadenopathy was the commonest presenting feature of persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection."
4848,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B vaccination programs have prevented infection in many dialysis patients, although the antibody response to vaccination is still insufficient in approximately 50%. Reinfection or reactivation of latent hepatitis B infection (HBV) has been reported in certain groups of immunosuppressed patients, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). We report the reactivation or reinfection of HBV with resurgence of hepatitis B surface antigen in a dialysis patient coinfected with HIV-1. Thus, in dialysis patients with latent HBV infection, with undetectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels, the potential exists to reactivate during immunosuppression associated with HIV-1 infection and/or end-stage renal disease. Reinfection with a different subtype is also possible. The development of hepatitis B surface antigenemia in this patient population creates a potential for transmission in the dialysis setting. This is of special concern since the number of patients infected with HIV-1 and with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection is increasing in urban units."
8259,0.001,1.0000,"Our study objective was to determine the current use of liver biopsy in chronic viral hepatitis and how patient management is affected by the procedure. Members of the Italian Association of Hospital Gastroenterologists were asked to complete a questionnaire for patients submitted to biopsy. Their clinical diagnosis was compared with the histological diagnosis. Of 660 patients evaluated, we selected 535 cases with viral infection. Concordance of clinical vs histologic diagnosis amounted to 84.3%, with 92.7% sensitivity and 32.4% specificity rates for diagnosing chronic hepatitis; the clinical diagnosis was correct in only 24 of 57 cases with cirrhosis. In 20 cases (3.7%) additional diagnoses were provided. The biopsy was rated avoidable in 36.8% of cases. Knowledge about grading and staging was considered of value in 59.6 and 66.4% of cases, respectively; however, when it became available, the scheduled treatment with interferon was not changed in 81.7 and 80.9% of cases. In the majority of patients with abnormal ALT and infection with HCV and/or HBV, histology documents mild/moderate inflammation with minimal fibrosis and liver biopsy neither increases the accuracy of clinical diagnosis nor affects the choice of therapy. The data from this study support the view that liver biopsies are less helpful than conventionally understood."
5228,0.001,1.0000,"Jamaica has the second highest number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and deaths in the Caribbean and a significant number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals have a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI). The study determined the prevalence of non-ulcerative and ulcerative STIs and their association with sexual risky behaviour in a sample of HIV seropositive men and women. This study was conducted at the Comprehensive Health Centre in Jamaica, a sexually transmitted infection referral centre. The sample comprised 138 men and 132 women age 15-49 years, of average 29.5 years. The study was retrospective, from 2000 to 2002, and sample collection was randomized. The sexual behaviours of the subjects were assessed from the case records. In the 270 HIV diagnosed cases examined, the prevalence of STIs was 51.1% in men and 48.9% in women, with 85.4% having one or more STIs with an average of four STIs per patient. There was a total occurrence of 744 STIs with non-gonococcal urethritis (19.4%), gonorrhoea (17.2%), candidiasis (13.4%), trichomonas (12.4%), genital ulcer (10.4%) and syphilis (7.3%) the most common in HIV infected men and women. The presence of STI was associated with continued practice of risky sexual behaviour. The age group most implicated was the 30-34 year old, and 73.1% of the HIV infected patients had multiple sexual partners with only 16.4% reporting frequent condom use. The study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of non-ulcerative and to a lesser extent ulcerative STIs in HIV infected patients in Jamaica. There are significant associations between STIs and continued high risk sexual practices in HIV infected men and women. The findings support the need for implementation of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies coupled with education about safe-sex practices in HIV prevention and STI control programmes."

The histological findings of the biopsy specimen were compatible with the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). An association between HIV infection and the development of PG was considered after a thorough investigation. Antiretroviral therapy without the use of adjunctive immunosuppressive agents resulted in clinical improvement. Our case implies that antiretroviral therapy alone could heal PG in untreated HIV-infected patients."
10010,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection-induced apoptosis of infected CD4 T cells as well as uninfected (bystander) CD4 T cells and other types of cells is a major factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Clinically, HIV-2 patients have a higher CD4 cell count at the time of an AIDS diagnosis, and generally have longer survival after development of symptoms. The mortality after an AIDS diagnosis has been reported to be more influenced by CD4 cell count than HIV type. Previous studies have shown significant variations in cytopathic effects following in vitro infection with primary isolates of HIV-1 or HIV-2 subtypes; however, the relative contributions of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection leading to cell death remain unclear. Using a human cell line, Jurkat, we examined differences in key molecules involved in apoptotic signaling pathways during infection with either HIV-1 or HIV-2. HIV-1 infection generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the expression of a larger number of molecules involved in cell signaling such as p47, p38alpha, JNK, c-Yes, total PKC, and decreased the expression of molecules such as p38beta, ERK1/2, and XIAP relative to HIV-2 infection. HIV-1 induced a higher degree of cell death through stronger activation of both apoptotic pathways. HIV-1 infection downregulated both Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expressions at later time points postinfection, while HIV-2 infection dramatically upregulated both Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expression. We also found that the expression of Bcl-X(L) or FLIP resulted in significant inhibition of HIV replication in Jurkat cells. These findings suggest that HIV-1 infection with high levels of cytotoxicity results in a higher level of cell death through apoptosis during a short time postinfection. The longer period of infection observed with HIV-2 with a lower degree of cytotoxicity was accompanied by increased Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expression. High protein levels of Bcl-X(L) or FLIP inhibit HIV replication and may be one explanation for the clinical observation that HIV-2 infected patients generally tend to be long-term nonprogressors with high CD4 lymphocyte counts compared with HIV-1 infected persons."
9811,0.001,1.0000,"Resistance to antiretroviral drugs remains an important limitation to successful human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapy. Resistance testing can improve treatment outcomes for infected individuals. The availability of new drugs from various classes, standardization of resistance assays, and the development of viral tropism tests necessitate new guidelines for resistance testing. The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations. Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important."

HIV patients were studied from 1993 to 2004, using information recorded in a database of the STI Clinic. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, patterns of risk behavior and test results (ELISA-HIV, IFA-HIV, HBsAg, viral load and CD4 counts) were analyzed. We analyzed 851 HIV patients. Median age was 35.0 (interquartile range 30; 42) years and median years of education was 8.0 (IQR 5; 11). The prevalence of chronic HBV was 3.8% (95% CI 2.5-5.1). Illicit drug use was reported in 185 (21.7%) cases, alcohol abuse in 80 (9.4%) cases, men who have sex with men in 116 (13.6%) cases, and past STI in 320 (37.6%) cases. Chronic HBV was associated with intravenous drug use, male gender, STI associated with HIV diagnosis, and death. There is a need for prevention and assistance strategies to control the evolution of this infection in HIV patients."
9651,0.001,1.0000,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients with subsequent higher susceptibility to EBV-associated lymphoproliferations. In contrast to transplant recipients, limited data are available concerning the EBV load in HIV-infected patients, with or without AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We developed a TaqMan real-time PCR assay, allowing both the EBV genome and a cellular gene to be quantified in order to obtain a reliable normalized measurement of the EBV load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). With a wide 6-log(10) quantification range and inter-assay variations of less than 24%, this quantitative PCR was sufficiently accurate and reproducible for routine follow-up. The EBV load was determined in PBMCs from 113 HIV-infected patients, 11 patients with primary HIV infection and 24 HIV-seronegative healthy controls. The rates of EBV detection were similar in the three groups. However, EBV loads were higher in the HIV-infected group (P < 0.00001) except for the patients with primary HIV infection. Unexpectedly, EBV loads were not correlated with the clinical stages of HIV infection or HIV replication, and did not depend on the degree of immunodepression, as judged by CD4+ counts. This study contributes towards the definition of the baseline EBV load during HIV infection and stresses the broad inter-individual variability of the EBV load in HIV-infected patients. Real-time PCR provides a useful tool that can be used in further longitudinal studies to assess the relevance of the EBV load to identify HIV-infected patients with a high risk of EBV-associated lymphoproliferations."

We isolated and treated patients who were suspected to have TB. To determine risk factors for in-prison transmission of TB, we conducted a case-control study to compare inmate case patients infected with a distinct outbreak strain of TB with control subjects who resided in the HIV unit. We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak."
1401,0.001,1.0000,"A prospective, case-control study was undertaken to characterise seizures occurring in the context of human immunodeficiency type-1 (HIV-1) infection. Fifty consecutive patients with a documented seizure were enrolled along with fifty control patients. Among cases the median CD4 cell count was 8/mm3 and 84% had a prior AIDS defining illness; 14/mm3 and 80% among the control group. Generalised seizures were seen in 84%, partial with secondary generalisation in 10% and partial in 6%. Associated conditions included cerebral toxoplasmosis (22%), cryptococcal meningitis (8%), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (6%), cytomegalovirus encephalitis (6%), central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (2%), and other causes (14%) including pre-HIV epilepsy. No associated condition was identified in 42% of patients of whom 18% were receiving foscarnet therapy at the time of seizure, compared with 4% of control patients (p < 0.001). Concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid â2-microglobulin and neopterin, markers that have been associated with HIV-1 involvement of the CNS, were elevated in 12/12 and 13/13 patients, respectively, of the group with no identifiable cause for their seizure. We conclude that seizures occur principally in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease, with opportunistic infections of the CNS the predominant underlying condition. In the group with no identifiable cause foscarnet therapy and subclinical HIV-1 involvement of the CNS may be factors responsible for seizure activity."
7099,0.001,1.0000,"Although in Western Europe and North America the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined in patients awaiting renal transplantation, it remains a relevant clinical problem, mainly in patients with a long history of renal replacement therapy (RRT) who may have been infected many years ago. At the same time, a significant proportion of renal transplant recipients (RTR) is at risk for HBV infection in areas with endemic HBV. HBV infection may increase morbidity and mortality in RTR. The majority of long-term studies reported reduced patient survival compared with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative RTR. The risk for morbidity and mortality of HBsAg-positive RTR transplantation is probably related to the extent of pretransplant liver disease. A thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy in many patients, is required to assess the individual HBsAg-positive patient's risk-benefit ratio. The influence of immunosuppressive therapy on HBV replication and HBV-associated complications is not well established and for clinical practice individually tailored immunosuppression is recommended in HBsAg-positive RTR. Careful screening for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RTR and a regular clinical follow-up after renal transplantation (RTX) including liver sonography is required for early detection of HBV-associated complications. With the availability of new antiviral drugs, new options for pre- and posttransplant therapy might improve the prognosis of RTR with chronic HBV infection."
6607,0.001,1.0000,"Ethanol consumption is negatively associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and general health in HIV positive individuals. Previously, we demonstrated ethanol-mediated alterations to metabolism of elvitegravir (EVG) in human liver microsomes. In the current study, we investigated ethanol influence on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of EVG in HIV infected monocytic (U1) cells. U1 cells were treated with 5 μM EVG, 2 μM Cobicistat (COBI), a booster drug, and 20 mM ethanol for up to 24 hours. EVG, HIV p24 levels, alterations in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, MRP1, and MDR1 protein expressions were measured. Presence of ethanol demonstrated a significant effect on the total exposures of both EVG and EVG in combination with COBI. Ethanol also increased the HIV replication despite the presence of drugs and this elevated HIV replication was reduced in the presence of MRP1 and MDR1 inhibitors. Consequently, a slight increase in EVG concentration was observed in the presence of MRP1 inhibitor but not with MDR1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CYP3A4, MRP1 and MDR1 protein levels were significantly induced in treatment groups which included ethanol compared to those with no treatment. In summary, these findings suggest that Ethanol reduces intra cellular EVG exposure by modifying drug metabolism and transporter protein expression. This study provides valuable evidence for further investigation of ethanol effects on the intracellular concentration of EVG in ex vivo or in vivo studies."
2170,0.001,1.0000,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute prothrombotic disorder. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an identified precipitant. This study reviewed 30 episodes of HIV-associated TTP in 24 patients from the South-East England Apheresis units, over the last 10 years. All patients were heterosexual Black Africans. First presentation of TTP revealed a new diagnosis of HIV in eight patients. TTP relapse occurred on six occasions (in four patients) as a result of non-adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Prompt initiation/re-initiation of HAART in parallel with plasma exchange (PEX)±steroid led to prompt remission. Adjunct immunomodulatory agents (e.g. Rituximab) were required in 10% of cases. Once-daily HAART regimens are recommended, being compatible with PEX requirement, maximizing drug exposure between PEX. High viral loads (>500,000 copies/ml) require more PEX to remission. ADAMTS13 activity was reduced (<5%) as detected by collagen-binding assay and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G antibodies were raised in 80%. Continued HAART-adherence ensured a durable TTP remission with associated viral control resulting in no evidence of relapse. PEX and HAART are associated with replenishment of ADAMTS13 and viral suppression. More PEX is required in cases with higher viral loads. Continued HAART maintains remission. In a small proportion of cases, further immunomodulatory therapy may be required."
4037,0.001,1.0000,"Cohort studies have shown that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can improve liver-related mortality in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. A reduction in the accelerated liver fibrosis progression observed in HIV infection induced by HAART could explain these findings. A few studies have assessed the impact of HAART on liver fibrosis, but with contradictory results. Therefore, we evaluated the associations between the use of different antiretroviral drug classes and HAART combinations, and liver fibrosis in HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C. Six hundred and eighty-three HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who underwent a liver biopsy and who had not received anti-HCV treatment were included. Age at HCV infection < 23years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.3-0.9, P = 0.05) and protease inhibitor (PI)-based HAART versus no use of HAART (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9, P = 0.01) were negatively associated with advanced fibrosis (> or = F3). PI-based HAART versus no use of HAART (AOR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.2-0.7, P = 0.001) was negatively associated with fibrosis progression rate > or = 0.2 units/year and independently of age at HCV infection and CD4+ T-cell counts. Fifteen (17%) patients treated only with PIs and zidovudine plus lamivudine showed > or = F3, compared with 65 (37%) patients without HAART (P = 0.001). Forty (31%) patients on PI and stavudine plus lamivudine showed > or = F3 (P = 0.3, when compared with patients with no HAART). The use of PI-based HAART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is associated with less severe fibrosis and slower progression of fibrosis. The nucleoside analogue backbone in a HAART regimen may influence this association."
2088,0.001,1.0000,"The current therapies to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are limited. Recently, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) systems, originally identified in bacteria and archaea, have been found to consist of an RNA-based adaptive immune system that degrades complimentary sequences of invading plasmids and viruses. Here, we studied the effects of the CRISPR/CRISPR-associated Cas9 system that was targeted to the surface antigen (HBsAg)-encoding region of HBV, both in a cell culture system and in vivo. The HBsAg levels in the media of the cells and in the sera of mice were analyzed by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The HBV DNA levels were assessed by quantitative PCR and HBsAg expression in mouse livers was assessed by an immunohistochemical assay. The amount of HBsAg secreted in the cell culture and mouse serum was reduced by CRISPR/Cas9 treatment. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed almost no HBsAg-positive cells in the liver tissue of CRISPR/Cas9-S1+X3-treated mice. The CRISPR/Cas9 system efficiently produced mutations in HBV DNA. Thus, CRISPR/Cas9 inhibits HBV replication and expression in vitro and in vivo and may constitute a new therapeutic strategy for HBV infection. "
9056,0.001,1.0000,"Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a central component of the innate immune response and thus may be important for determining hepatitis B virus (HBV) persistence. Since single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding MBL (mbl2) alter the level of functional MBL, we hypothesized that mbl2 genotypes are a determinant of HBV persistence or recovery from viral infection. We tested this hypothesis by using a nested case control design with 189 persons with HBV persistence matched to 338 individuals who had naturally recovered from HBV infection. We determined genotypes of two promoter and three exon 1 SNPs in mbl2 and grouped these genotypes according to the amount of functional MBL production. We found that the promoter SNP -221C, which leads to deficient MBL production, was more common in those subjects with viral persistence (odds ratio [OR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.89; P = 0.04). Those subjects homozygous for the combination of promoter and exon 1 genotypes associated with the highest amount of functional MBL had significantly increased odds of recovery from infection (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.84; P = 0.005). Conversely, those homozygous for the combination of promoter and exon 1 genotypes which produce the lowest amount of functional MBL were more likely to have viral persistence (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.02 to 3.01; P = 0.04). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that functional MBL plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."
2328,0.001,1.0000,"Telbivudine (LdT) is an orally L-nucleoside with potent and specific antihepatitis B virus (HBV) activity. The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion of LdT treatment than other anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes of regulatory T cell (Treg)/interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4+T helper (Th17) balance during LdT treatment and to discuss the relationship of Treg/Th17 balance with HBeAg change in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients receiving LdT antiviral treatment. Twenty-seven HBeAg-positive CHB patients received LdT for 24 weeks and the percentages of Tregs and cells (Th17 cells) in peripheral blood as well as the serum TGF-β1 and IL-17 levels in these patients were longitudinally analyzed. We found that the frequencies of Tregs and Th17 cells in peripheral blood as well as the serum TGF-β1 and IL-17 levels increased significantly in CHB patients compared with healthy controls. During the LdT treatment, the Tregs frequency and TGF-β1 level tended to decrease, and Th17 cells frequency and IL-17 level showed a reverse ""V""-type change. The frequency of Tregs and the ratio of Treg/Th17 were significantly lower in the HBeAg loss group than those in the HBeAg no-loss group at the baseline. More important, the Tregs frequency and TGF-β1 level were both positively correlated with HBeAg level during the LdT treatment for 24 weeks. Our data suggest that the lower Tregs frequency and Treg/Th17 ratio at the baseline of LdT treatment, the more likely to get the HBeAg loss. HBeAg negative can be predicted using changes in Tregs frequency and TGF-β1 level during LdT treatment in CHB patients. Maybe we could provide the immunology marker for exploring the mechanism of the higher HBeAg seroconversion rate of LdT therapy."

In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
7898,0.001,1.0000,"The RNA genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is converted into DNA after infection in order to integrate into the host cell DNA. However, a large number of these reverse-transcribed genomes remain unintegrated in the nucleus of infected cells. Currently, there are no data available about the intranuclear distribution pattern of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA in relation to nuclear structures as observed on the single-cell level. In the present study, we investigated the intranuclear fate of unintegrated viral DNA in cell lines expressing CD4 and coreceptors (HOS-CD4.CCR5 and U373-MAGI-CXCR4(CEM)) infected with HIV-1 (strain 89.6). We used a novel approach to distinguish in situ unintegrated from integrated viral DNA by performing fluorescent in situ hybridization on cells in which stress-induced chromosome condensation had been induced, a procedure that contracts chromosomes independent of the cell cycle. Cells infected for 15 h accumulated large amounts of HIV-1 DNA which was located between the condensed chromosome strands, allowing the identification of this viral DNA as unintegrated. In contrast, in HeLa/LAV, a cell line carrying integrated HIV-1 genomes, the great majority of viral DNA colocalized with the cellular DNA. We show that unintegrated HIV-1 DNA does not evenly distribute within the host cell nucleus but tends to aggregate into clusters containing many copies of the viral genomes. The formation of these DNA clusters was independent of viral DNA replication and thus appeared to result solely from multiple infections. The DNA aggregates remained in the nuclei of infected cells for at least 25 h after the infection was stopped. The emergence of transcription sites, which most likely denote sites of the integrated provirus, lagged clearly behind the accumulation of viral DNA. These transcription foci could not be linked to unintegrated DNA molecules, suggesting that this DNA type is unable to transcribe, at least at levels comparable to those of integrated DNA. Neither unintegrated HIV-1 DNA nor transcription foci nor integrated DNA was observed to associate with nuclear domain 10 (ND10), a nuclear structure known to represent the site where several DNA viruses replicate and transcribe. Also, HIV-1 does not modify ND10 at early or late times of infection. There was no specific association of HIV-1 transcripts with splicing factor SC35 domains, in contrast to what has been reported for a number of both cellular and viral genes. Surprisingly, unintegrated HIV-1 DNA was found to accumulate within or in close association with SC35 domains, demonstrating a specific distribution of the viral DNA within the host cell nucleus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that unintegrated proviral HIV-1 DNA does not randomly localize within infected cells but preferentially aggregates in the nucleus within SC35 domains."
6709,0.001,1.0000,"The national blood transfusion policies have been changed significantly in recent years in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donors at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul and to evaluate the effect of changes in the national blood transfusion policies on the prevalence of these infections. The screening results of 72695 blood donations at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul between January and December 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were screened by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method. Samples found to be positive for anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV were confirmed by Inno-Lia HCV Ab III and Inno-Lia HIV I/II Score, respectively. The seropositivity rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were determined as 1.76%, 0.07%, and 0.008%, respectively. Compared to the previously published data from Red Crescent Centers in Turkey, it was found that HBV and HCV seroprevalances decreased and HIV seroprevalance increased in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that the drop in HBV and HCV prevalence rates are likely multifactorial and may have resulted from more diligent donor questioning upon screening, a higher level of public awareness on viral hepatitis as well as the expansion of HBV vaccination coverage in Turkey. Another factor to contribute to the decreased prevalence of HCV stems from the use of more sensitive confirmation testing on all reactive results, thereby eliminating a fair amount of false positive cases. Despite similar transmission routes, the increase in HIV prevalence in contrast to HBV and HCV may be linked to the increase in AIDS cases in Turkey in recent years."
1070,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major clinical problem in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and can lead to many serious consequences. This study was carried out in order to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and the possible risk factors for acquiring it, in patients on maintenance HD. All patients on regular HD in seven hospitals of the Royal Medical Services, Amman, Jordan, were studied during the period between July and December 2006. The medical history and records of these patients were reviewed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), and possible risk factors for acquiring this infection. A total of 430 patients on HD with a mean age of 47.3 years were studied. Three patients, who were positive for HBsAg before starting dialysis, were excluded from the study. The remaining 427 patients, who were HBsAg negative before starting dialysis were included. Of these, 25 (5.9%) became HbsAg-positive during the study period. Being on HD for longer than two years and positive history of blood transfusion(s) were more frequently noticed in the HbsAg-positive group (88% and 60% respectively) compared with the HbsAg-negative group (43% and 56% respectively). Of 379/402 (94%) patients who remained Hbs Ag-negative and 1/25 (4%) of those who converted to Hbs Ag-positive were reportedly vaccinated. Our study suggests that the prevalence of HbsAg positivity in our HD patients was 5.9%. Dialysis for more than two years, but not history of blood transfusions, was noted to be a significant risk factor for acquiring this infection. Vaccination against the HBV gives good protection against this virus."
2336,0.001,1.0000,"Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutations have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cross-sectional case-control study examined the relationship between HCC and mutations in the enhancer II/core promoter and precore regions of HBV by comparing 135 Korean HCC patients infected with HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2; HCC group) with 135 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non- HCC group). Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group. Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group. However, no association was observed between mutations in the precore region and HCC. Upon multivariate analysis, the presence of the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was an independent predictive factor for HCC. The addition of the T1653 or T1689 [corrected] mutation to T1762/A1764 increased the risk of HCC. In conclusion, the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and/or T1762/A1764 mutations were associated with the development of HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV/C2."
6484,0.001,1.0000,"A cross-sectional study was carried out in employees of 17 Greek companies with the aim of assessing the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus, identifying associated prognostic/risk factors and evaluating the effectiveness of a questionnaire as a pre-screening tool. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and a random sample of them was asked to provide a blood sample for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) testing. Individual questions or combinations of them were evaluated in terms of their ability to detect HBV or HCV(+) cases. Of 9085 eligible employees, 6074 (67%) completed the questionnaire. Of 990 samples obtained, 19.9% were anti-HBc(+), 2.6% HBsAg(+) and 0.5% anti-HCV(+). All anti-HCV(+) cases had multiple parenteral risk factors. Multiple logistic regression identified associations between anti-HBc and older age, family members with chronic hepatitis, job category and history of transfusion before 1992. HBsAg(+) was associated with older age and history of transfusion before 1992. None of the risk/prognostic factors had sufficient sensitivity and specificity for HBV but report of at least one risk factor identified all HCV(+) cases. Anti-HCV screening of those with at least two parenteral risk factors not only identified all anti-HCV(+) cases but also resulted in 86% decrease in the screening cost. Under the light of recent treatment advances, targeted questionnaire-based screening of asymptomatic people may prove to be a cost-effective way to face hepatitis C."
3195,0.001,1.0000,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide and a known factor leading to increased risk of death, especially in conjunction with other risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of DM among HIV-infected patients and its association with overall mortality. All HIV-infected patients 18 years or older who were followed in the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) cohort from January 1991 to December 2011 were included. Time-updated covariables included DM status, calendar year, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and CD4 cell counts. Fixed demographic covariables included gender and age at entry. Poisson models were used to calculate mortality rate ratios (RR) with robust variances. Among the 4,871 patients included, 1,192 (24.4%) died (mortality rate = 4.72/100 person-years [PY]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.46-5.00). Death rates were significantly higher among those presenting with DM compared with those who did not (6.16/100 vs. 4.61/100 PY, respectively. p = 0.001). In the final model, DM was significantly associated with mortality (RR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.57-1.94; p < 0.001). When the analysis was restricted to those on cART or the period post-1996, the association between DM and mortality was even stronger (RR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.91-2.46; p < 0.001 and RR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.75-2.18; p < 0.001, respectively). Among the major groups of cause of deaths (CODs), the proportion of AIDS-related conditions in patients with DM was lower (74.27% vs. 58.93%, respectively; p < 0.001); whereas in non-AIDS-related conditions, nonimmunodeficiency-related causes (22.44% vs. 34.82%, respectively; p = 0.004) were more common in patients with DM. In conclusion, DM was associated with increased mortality rates even after controlling for HIV-related variables associated to this outcome. Differences in the underlying CODs were identified, reinforcing the necessity to assess and treat comorbidities such as DM in HIV-infected patients."
3213,0.001,1.0000,"A small number of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remain clinically and immunologically healthy for more than a decade after infection. Recent reports suggest that these individuals may be infected with an attenuated strain of HIV-1; however, a common genetic basis for viral attenuation has not been found in all cases. In the present study, we examined the functional properties of the HIV-1 env genes from six long-term survivors. env clones were generated by PCR amplification of proviral env sequences, followed by cloning of the amplified regions into expression vectors. Eight to ten clones from each subject were screened by transient transfection for expression of the envelope precursor glycoprotein, gp160. Those clones expressing gp160 were then cotransfected with an HIV-1 luciferase reporter vector, pNL4-3Env(-)LUC(+) and evaluated for their ability to mediate infection of phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in single-cycle infectivity assays. Clones expressing gp160 were identified for all six long-term survivors, indicating the presence of proviral env genes with intact open reading frames. For two subjects, D and DH, the encoded envelope glycoproteins yielded high levels of luciferase activity when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 virions and tested in single-cycle infectivity assays. In contrast, envelope glycoproteins cloned from four other long-term survivors were poorly processed and failed to mediate infection. Sequencing of the gp120/41 cleavage site and conserved gp41 cysteine residues of these clones did not reveal any obvious mutations to explain the functional defects. The functional activity of env clones from long-term survivors D and DH was comparable to that seen with several primary HIV-1 env genes cloned from individuals with disease progression and AIDS. These results suggest that the long-term survival of subjects D and DH is not associated with overt functional defects in env; however, functional abnormalities in env may contribute to maintaining a long-term asymptomatic state in the other four cases we studied."
133,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate why human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is less virulent than HIV-1, the evolution of coreceptor usage, autologous neutralization, envelope sequence and glycosylation was studied in sequentially obtained virus isolates and sera from four HIV-2-infected individuals. Neutralization of primary HIV-2 isolates was tested by a cell line-based assay and IgG purified from patients' sera. Significant autologous neutralization was observed for the majority (39 of 54) of the HIV-2 serum-virus combinations tested, indicating that neutralization escape is rare in HIV-2 infection. Furthermore, sera from 18 HIV-2 patients displayed extensive heterologous cross-neutralization when tested against a panel of six primary HIV-2 isolates. This indicates that HIV-2 is intrinsically more sensitive to antibody neutralization than HIV-1. In line with earlier reports, HIV-2 isolates could use several alternative receptors in addition to the major coreceptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Intrapatient evolution from CCR5 use to CXCR4 use was documented for the first time. Furthermore, CXCR4 use was linked to the immunological status of the patients. Thus, all CXCR4-using isolates, except one, were obtained from patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells microl(-1). Sequence analysis revealed an association between coreceptor usage and charge of the V3 loop of the HIV-2 envelope, as well as an association between the rate of disease progression and the glycosylation pattern of the envelope protein. Furthermore, HIV-2 isolates had fewer glycosylation sites in the V3 domain than HIV-1 (two to three versus four to five). It is proposed here that HIV-2 has a more open and accessible V3 domain than HIV-1, due to differences in glycan packing, and that this may explain its broader coreceptor usage and greater sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies."
6475,0.001,1.0000,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."
1101,0.001,1.0000,"Little is known regarding the prevalence and distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos. We sought to determine the prevalence of HBV exposure (serum HBV core antibody; anti-HBc), active HBV infection (serum HBV surface antigen; HBsAg), and vaccine-induced HBV immunity (antibody against HBV surface antigen; anti-HBs) in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos and consider how these data inform clinical screening recommendations. Our analysis included 11,999 women and men of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a population-based, household survey in four urban communities (Bronx, NY; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; and San Diego, CA) of U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized self-identifying Hispanic/Latino adults ages 18-74. Vaccine-induced immunity was defined as detection of anti-HBs, but not anti-HBc. However, if anti-HBc were present, it was considered evidence of exposure to HBV, with detection of HBsAg used to distinguish those with active HBV infection. Mean age was 45.7 years, and 7,153 were women. Vaccine-induced immunity was greatest among those ages 18-29 years (60.2% in women, 54% in men) and decreased with increasing age, regardless of country of birth. The prevalence of active HBV infection was 0.29% (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.43), but varied by country of birth. Those born in the Dominican Republic had the highest prevalence of HBV exposure (20.3% in women, 29.7% in men) and active HBV infection (0.95%)."
789,0.001,1.0000,"Interleukin-12 and -18 (IL-12 and IL-18) are known to enhance the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response synergistically, but their precise involvement in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not well known, especially for IL-18. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to study the production of these cytokines in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of patients infected chronically with HCV before initiation of antiviral therapy. Fifty-six patients and 40 healthy controls were evaluated. Patients infected with genotype 1 or with genotype other than genotype 1 HCV had significantly a high production of plasma IL-12 compared with controls (P < 0.05). However, patients infected with genotype 1 HCV had lower levels of PBMC IL-18 than were founded in the controls (P < 0.05); plasma IL-18 also tended to be lower in this group of patients than in the controls, although nonsignificantly. Plasma IL-18 was related to hepatic histological activity (P < 0.05). The data suggest a relationship between these two cytokines and some features of HCV infection, so that their respective production in relation to the outcome of the infection deserves further study."
8220,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are leading causes of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Because underreporting has complicated the understanding of disease burden, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine requested that CDC perform a comprehensive evaluation of national viral hepatitis surveillance. Hepatitis surveillance data rely on local and state estimates, and a better understanding of reporting at these levels can inform strategies to improve national data quality. As an initial assessment, CDC partnered with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and an urban health-care system in southeastern Michigan to evaluate the completeness of reporting (including case status, demographic, and risk factor information) of cases of chronic HBV and HCV infection among persons who were enrolled in a multicenter chronic hepatitis cohort study to the MDCH viral hepatitis registry. This report summarizes the results of that assessment. Among clinically confirmed chronic hepatitis infections, 82% of HBV infections and 65% of HCV infections were reported. Completeness of reporting of chronic HBV and HCV infections was significantly improved for those with more recent clinical diagnoses, but reporting still remained incomplete. The completeness of reporting varied significantly by demographic characteristics of patients with HCV infection. Few reports of either HBV or HCV infection included risk factors. Improving surveillance of chronic hepatitis in Michigan will require exploration of more efficient methods for the transfer of laboratory and clinical data and evaluation of the most appropriate sources for risk factor information to aid in the prevention of viral hepatitis transmission. Similar collaborations with health-care institutions that use electronic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and laboratory data can provide local and state health departments with insight into the challenges to case reporting in their jurisdictions."
9618,0.001,1.0000,"Certain immunological parameters (i.e. low CD4+ T cell numbers, high serum soluble CD8) have been described as prognostic factors for the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to later clinical stages. In the present study we have found in one hundred HIV-infected Spanish patients (81% drug abusers, 7% homosexuals, 6% heterosexuals, and 6% other or unknown risk groups) that CD11b+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells are increased in those with persistent lymphadenopathy as compared to other clinical stages (asymptomatic, AIDS-related complex and AIDS). Serum IgA was significantly increased in AIDS patients, and in patients at any other clinical stage who had concomitant infections (mainly mycobacterial and fungal). CD11b (an integrin with complement receptor functions) may thus be of clinical interest for the staging of HIV-infected patients, and reflect stage-selective immunological changes in mononuclear cell biology during HIV infection. High IgA on the other hand, would be a marker of concomitant infection as well as of disease progression. The results concern mostly drug addicts (the main risk group in Spain), but may apply to the other risk groups because no significant differences were detected between drug addicts (n = 81) and non-drug addicts (n = 19) for the studied variables (p greater than 0.05)."

Mother infant transmission plays the most important role in the endemy resulting in 20% of the children being HBsAg carrier at 4 years of age. A large proportion of HBV carriers will develop a chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis and ultimately to primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers (7% of neonates) have an estimated risk of 90% to become HBsAg chronic carriers. A plan for control of Hepatitis B in Taiwan will aim to solve the problem of these children, as a priority. A Hepatitis B vaccine trial has been undertaken in Taiwan since October 1981 in a selected population of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of Hepatitis B vaccine alone or in combination with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin in preventing maternal infant transmission of HBV infection. A three way prophylactic regimen comparison was carried out. Subjects consisted of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. Only mature and apparently healthy neonates were included with the parents' formal consent based on real knowledge and understanding. Babies were randomly included in four different groups of study."

In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."
5098,0.001,1.0000,"After the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), there has been a decrease in the incidence of lymphoma among the HIV-infected population and also significantly improved survival rates. We describe a remarkable case of an HIV-infected patient with advanced stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), completely regressed with the use of HAART alone. He remained disease-free for 6 years and he achieved cure without chemotherapy. Although several cases of low-grade lymphoma with complete regression were reported, we could not find any case of stage IV high-grade malignant lymphoma with HAART alone in complete remission for over 5 years from our review of the literature. This unique case shows the importance of HAART in improving survival and achieving cure in HIV-high-grade malignant lymphoma."
4587,0.001,1.0000,"Despite recent advances in the chemotherapy of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), an effective viral suppression after cessation of therapy has not yet been achieved. To investigate whether hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T-cell responses are inducible and can contribute to the viral suppression after cessation of the therapy, we conducted a proof-of-concept study with a DNA vaccine comprising of most HBV genes plus genetically engineered interleukin-12 DNA (IL-12N222L) in 12 CHB carriers being treated with lamivudine (LAM). When the ex vivo and/or cultured IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was performed, the detectable HBV-specific IFN-gamma secreting T-cell responses were observed at the end of treatment and during a follow-up. These type 1T-cell responses, particularly CD4(+) memory T-cell responses could be maintained for at least 40 weeks after the therapy and correlated with virological responses, but not with alanine aminotransferase elevation. Moreover, DNA vaccination under LAM treatment appeared to be well-tolerated and showed 50% of virological response rate in CHB carriers. Thus, a combination therapy of the DNA vaccine with chemotherapy may be one of new immunotherapeutic methods for the cure of CHB."
6455,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis virus infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although anti-viral therapies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have dramatically progressed during the past decade, the estimated number of people chronically infected with HBV and/or HCV is ~370 million, and hepatitis virus-associated hepatocarcinogenesis is a serious health concern worldwide. Understanding the mechanism of virus-associated carcinogenesis is crucial toward both treatment and prevention, and the recently developed whole genome/exome sequencing analysis using next-generation sequencing technologies has contributed to unveiling the landscape of genetic and epigenetic aberrations in not only tumor tissues but also the background liver tissues underlying chronic liver damage caused by hepatitis virus infection. Several major mechanisms underlie the genetic and epigenetic aberrations in the hepatitis virus-infected liver, such as the generation of reactive oxidative stress, ectopic expression of DNA mutator enzymes, and dysfunction of the DNA repair system. In addition, direct oncogenic effects of hepatitis virus, represented by the integration of HBV-DNA, are observed in infected hepatocytes. Elucidating the whole picture of genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, will facilitate the development of efficient treatment and prevention strategies for hepatitis virus-associated HCC."
5858,0.001,1.0000,"Studies on human genetic variations are a useful source of knowledge about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. The Langerin protein, found at the surface of Langerhans cells, has an important protective role in HIV-1 infection. Differences in Langerin function due to host genetic factors could influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "
314,0.001,1.0000,"We have studied the extent of genetic and phenotypic diversification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) upon 15 serial passages of clonal viral populations in MT-4 cell cultures. Several genetic and phenotypic modifications previously noted during evolution of HIV-1 in infected humans were also observed upon passages of the virus in cell culture. Notably, the transition from non-syncytium-inducing to syncytium-inducing phenotype (previously observed during disease progression) and fixation of amino acid substitutions at the main antigenic loop V3 of gp120 were observed in the course of replication of the virus in MT-4 cell cultures in the absence of immune selection. Interestingly, most genetic and phenotypic alterations occurred upon passage of the virus at a low multiplicity of infection (0.001 infectious particles per cell) rather than at a higher multiplicity of infection (0.1 infectious particles per cell). The degree of genetic diversification attained by HIV-1, estimated by the RNase A mismatch cleavage method and by nucleotide sequencing, is of about 0.03% of genomic sites mutated after 15 serial passages. This value is not significantly different from previous estimates for foot-and-mouth disease virus when subjected to a similar process and analysis. We conclude that several genetic and phenotypic modifications of HIV-1 previously observed in vivo occur also in the constant environment provided by a cell culture system. Dilute passage promotes in a highly significant way the expression of deviant HIV-1 genomes."

This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

This study tests two predictions: (a) levels of preimmune anti-gpl20 Igs are a polymorphic trait; and, (b) these levels are correlated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission. The first prediction was confirmed in a longitudinal study of a low-risk seronegative population. In this group, levels of both endogenous anti-gpl20 IgM and IgG varied widely, but were characteristic and stable for each individual. The second prediction was addressed in a study of participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, in which men ""susceptible"" and ""resistant"" to HIV infection were identified based on numbers of sexual partners and eventual seroconversion. Specimens consisted of archival sera obtained > 2 yr before seroconversion. Men in the susceptible population (low-risk seroconverters) were distinguished by low levels of anti-gpl20 IgG. We conclude that the level of preimmune anti-gpl20 IgG is a polymorphic population trait, and low levels are a potentially specific and significant factor in homosexual transmission of HIV infection."
2477,0.001,1.0000,"Potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in plasma to levels below the limit of detection for up to 2 years, but the extent to which viral replication is suppressed is unknown. To search for ongoing viral replication in 10 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy for up to 1 year, the emergence of genotypic drug resistance across different compartments was studied and correlated with plasma viral RNA levels. In addition, lymph node (LN) mononuclear cells were assayed for the presence of multiply spliced RNA. Population sequencing of HIV-1 pol was done on plasma RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA, PBMC DNA, LN RNA, LN DNA, and RNA from virus isolated from PBMCs or LNs. A special effort was made to obtain sequences from patients with undetectable plasma RNA, emphasizing the rapidly emerging lamivudine-associated M184V mutation. Furthermore, concordance of drug resistance mutations across compartments was investigated. No evidence for viral replication was found in patients with plasma HIV RNA levels of <20 copies/ml. In contrast, evolving genotypic drug resistance or the presence of multiply spliced RNA provided evidence for low-level replication in subjects with plasma HIV RNA levels between 20 and 400 copies/ml. All patients failing therapy showed multiple drug resistance mutations in different compartments, and multiply spliced RNA was present upon examination. Concordance of nucleotide sequences from different tissue compartments obtained concurrently from individual patients was high: 98% in the protease and 94% in the reverse transcriptase regions. These findings argue that HIV replication differs significantly between patients on potent antiretroviral therapy with low but detectable viral loads and those with undetectable viral loads."
4457,0.001,1.0000,"Viruses have been found to exhibit protein kinase activity associated with their purified viral particles. HIV-1 virus particles possess a novel 72 kD protein, Topoisomerase II beta kinase (Topo IIβKHIV) activity. The enzyme, isolated and purified from PEGprecipitated HIV-1 particles, is insensitive against a diverse set of known kinase inhibitors. The pyridine derivatives were found to be active against both Topo IIβKHIV activity and HIV-1 replication. For both kinase antagonism and anti-HIV-1 activity the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) models were proposed. The CoMFA model was also evaluated independently with a set of test molecules for their anti-viral activity. The kinase inhibition and anti-viral activities for these inhibitors, tested in an in vitro kinase agree with the CoMFA model (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.642 with six principal components), lower acceptable results are obtained with anti- HIV-1 activity (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.358 with four principal components) and also correlate with relative solvation free energy calculations. The predictive power of the models was evaluated with 2 test molecules each and tends to lie within 1 log unit. An in cell validation of the model with a representative inhibitor, 2-methoxypyridine shows its ability to inhibit Topo IIβ phosphorylation during acute HIV-1 infection. Close correlation of molecular fields of inhibitory domains of kinase and HIV-1 inhibitors suggests specificity of action of pyridine derivatives in affecting HIV-1 replication through inhibition of Kinase activity. These investigations suggest that Topo IIβKHIV is a potential target for an effective control of HIV-1 replication that would help in developing new anti-retroviral molecules. "
5256,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the prevalence and associated risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in patients attending inner-city clinics for sexually transmitted diseases in Baltimore, we screened 4028 patients anonymously, of whom 209 (5.2 percent) were seropositive for HIV. HIV-seropositivity rates were higher among men (6.3 percent) than women (3.0 percent) (P less than 0.001) and among blacks (5.0 percent) than whites (1.2 percent) (P less than 0.02). Among men, but not women, HIV seroprevalence increased markedly and steadily up to the age of 40. In men, HIV seropositivity was independently associated with increased age, black race, a history of homosexual contact, and the use of parenteral drugs. In women, a history of parenteral drug use or of being a sexual partner of a bisexual man or parenteral drug user were independently predictive of HIV seropositivity. In men, HIV seropositivity was also associated with a history of syphilis or a reactive serologic test for syphilis, and in women, with a history of genital warts. Since these associations were independent of the type and number of reported sexual partners, they raise the possibility that sexually transmitted diseases that disrupt epithelial surfaces may be important in the transmissibility of HIV. In addition, on a self-administered questionnaire, one third of HIV-infected men and one half of infected women did not acknowledge previous high-risk behavior for HIV exposure. These data suggest that patients at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases represent a group at high risk for HIV infection, and that screening, counseling, and intensive education should be offered to all patients attending such clinics."
564,0.001,1.0000,"Antibody to hepatitis E virus of IgG class (anti-HEV IgG) is regularly detected in industrialized countries, where HEV is non-endemic, at levels not exceeding 2-3%; seropositive individuals are often found in certain groups of patients and professionals exposed to an increased risk of blood-borne infections. The present study was aimed at the identification of anti-HEV IgG in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), living in Russia and Belarus, an area of low anti-HEV prevalence with a moderate spread of HIV infection and AIDS. In Russia, 13 out of 117 HIV-infected patients (11.1%) were found to be anti-HEV seropositive. This differed significantly from the frequency observed in the normal population (1.7%) but not from the frequency in a matching control, high-risk group consisting of male prisoners (8.0%). No difference in the frequency of anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was found between groups of HIV-infected men subdivided by sexual orientation. The rate of anti-HEV seropositivity increased with the progression of HIV infection, reaching 43.3% in AIDS patients and 38.1% in those who died from AIDS. In Belarus, anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was not found among 20 HIV-infected subjects nor among individuals from the control risk group, which consisted of 25 intravenous drug users. In conclusion, HEV infection may have common transmission mechanisms (risk factors) with HIV infection rather than represent an additional opportunistic infection in AIDS."
6569,0.001,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is predominantly a hepatotropic virus but also infects cells of the lymphatic system. HBV genomes (DNA, messenger (m)RNA, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA) and proteins have been found in extrahepatic sites such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. HBV entry into hepatocytes occurs by binding of the HBV preS1 surface protein to its specific receptor, the bile acid transporter, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Although the mechanism of HBV entry into lymphatic cells is unknown, the pre S1 encoded surface protein is thought to be involved. Extrahepatic HBV infection has been studied in both chronic HBV (CHB) and in occult HBV infection (OBI). Studies have shown that HBV genomes are present in different PBMC subsets from chronically infected carriers. Unique HBV variants have been found in PBMC compared to plasma or liver in both nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treated and untreated CHB carriers, suggesting replication and compartment specific evolution of HBV. In HBV coinfection, HBV genomes were found in PBMC from hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) co-infected individuals. Moreover, during pregnancy, the trans placental passage of HBV infected PBMC from highly viremic mothers to infants is one of the postulated means of vertical transmission of HBV. Taken together, HBV infection in extrahepatic sites (i.e., PBMC) is implicated in multiple facets of HBV pathogenesis such as persistence, viral evolution and vertical transmission."
2441,0.001,1.0000,"The association between risk behaviors and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been extensively studied. It is also proved that impulsivity is associated with risk behaviors. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between HCV and impulsivity, a characteristic that can contribute directly to these risk behaviors. This study aimed to investigate HCV-infected individuals' impulsivity and whether this feature mediates risk behavior. Adult patients with liver diseases (n=269) were divided into two groups: viral group (n=157) - patients with HCV and nonviral group (n=112). Risk behaviors were evaluated by a sociodemographic questionnaire. Impulsivity was assessed through Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-11. Psychiatric comorbidities were investigated by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.0. The viral group patients had higher impulsivity than the nonviral group in all domains: attentional impulsivity, motor impulsivity, and nonplanning. Risk behaviors were also shown to be associated with impulsivity levels. Our results suggest that HCV-infected patients are more impulsive than individuals with other liver diseases, even when analyses are controlled for the presence of comorbid mental disorders. In addition, at-risk behavior was significantly mediated by impulsivity."
2821,0.001,1.0000,"This study was designed to investigate the contribution of miRNA-122-binding site polymorphism at the IL-1A gene and its multiplicative interactions with hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutations in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 1021 healthy controls, 302 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, and 2011 HBsAg-positive subjects (including 1021 HCC patients) were enrolled in this study. Quantitative PCR was used to genotype rs3783553. HBV mutations were determined by direct sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations of rs3783553, mutations, and their interactions with the risk of HCC. No significant association was found between rs3783553 and the risk of HCC among healthy controls, HBsAg seroclearance subjects, HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC, and all controls. Additionally, rs3783553 was not significantly associated with chronic HBV infection, liver cirrhosis, HBV e antigen seroconversion, abnormal alanine aminotransferase, and high viral load (> 10(4) copies/ml). However, the TTCA insertion allele of rs3783553 was significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV C7A mutation compared with homozygous TTCA deletion carriers [(del/ins + ins/ins) vs. del/del, adjusted odds ratio (OR)= 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.09-2.02, P = 0.013]. Multiplicative interaction of rs3783553 with HBV preS deletion significantly reduced the risk of HCC in males, with an adjusted OR of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42-0.98; P = 0.041) after age and HBV genotype were adjusted. Although rs3783553 did not significantly affect genetic susceptibility to HBV-related HCC, its variant allele may predispose the host to selecting HBV C7A mutation during evolution and significantly reduce the risk of HCC caused by HBV preS deletion. This study provides an insight into the complex host-virus interaction in HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and is helpful in determining HBsAg-positive subjects who are likely to develop HCC. "
1370,0.001,1.0000,"Several studies have reported that the prevalence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is significantly overrepresented in patients affected by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), thus suggesting that besides the well-established link with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, a possible role for HCV is determining the development of at least some types of B-cell NHL. Such an association, however, seems to be limited to geographic areas where the presence of HCV is more relevant or endemic. According to a multistep pathogenetic model based on a large series of clinical, immunological, histological, and molecular evidences, an HCV antigen-driven polyclonal B-cell lymphoproliferation could be the initial phase of a process leading, in a variable time, into a true clonal disease. Particular genetic and environmental backgrounds could play a role in the development of a malignant phenotype, while specific HCV genotypes do not seem to be relevant in this setting. Hepatitis C virus correlated with NHL often shows some distinctive clinicopathological features, such as older age, liver damage, presence of monoclonal gammopathy (often with no clinically relevant cryoglobulinemic and/or rheumatoid activity), increased rate of autoimmune disorders, extranodal localizations, and restricted histological subtypes. Overall, the clinical outcome of HCV-positive NHL does not seem to be different from that of NHL patients without HCV infection. However, the evidence of a significant hepatic injury may predict a worse prognosis in these subjects."
6525,0.001,1.0000,"During the routine care of patients, pulmonary and critical care specialist may have significant exposure to respiratory infections and potentially infectious body fluids such as blood and pleural fluid. Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."
523,0.001,1.0000,"Oral opportunistic infections in the HIV-positive individual have been documented since the first reports of the epidemic, with many lesions associated with reduced CD4(+) T lymphocyte cell count. The most common oral lesions seen in HIV disease prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were oropharyngeal candidiasis and oral hairy leukoplakia. However, since the advent of HAART while many oral lesions have decreased significantly the incidence of oral warts has surprisingly increased. Despite the correlation of diminished CD4(+) T lymphocyte count to the occurrence of these lesions, it is rare for the lesions to occur concurrently suggesting that each pathologic lesion type is associated with distinct host immune dysfunctions. To date, the oral opportunistic infection most frequently investigated is oropharyngeal candidiasis, where data suggests that both systemic and local immunity is important for protection against infection. In contrast, recent investigations into the host responses associated with oral hairy leukoplakia and oral warts show little to no evidence of systemic or mucosal immune responsiveness despite the presumed competence of several types of leukocytes other than CD4(+) T cells. Together these data are suggesting that susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidasis in HIV-positive persons is predominantly immune-based, whereas protection or susceptibility to oral hairy leukoplakia and oral warts may be more associated with factors other than mucosal immune function."
5673,0.001,1.0000,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
2669,0.001,1.0000,"Abnormalities that predispose to a hypercoagulable state with an increased incidence of venous thrombosis have been described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and are associated with an increased mortality. A recent systematic review by Klein et al concluded that further studies are essential to elucidate the link between HIV infection and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We prospectively evaluated 24 consecutive, active people presenting with an acute DVT; 13 consented to HIV testing, revealing an HIV prevalence of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.04). In a matched healthy control group, the HIV prevalence was 4% (95% CI, 0.039-0.041). The high HIV prevalence in the DVT group that consented to testing was also significantly higher compared to that in the South African population, estimated to be 10% in 2005. Although the study numbers were low, a statistically significant increased prevalence of HIV infection was found in patients with acute DVTs."
4135,0.001,1.0000,"Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together, AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutics.

Although to a lesser extent, C-to-T1653 and T-to-V(C/A/G)1753 were also noteworthy in our previous study. To assess the clinical significance of these mutations, we determined the nucleotide sequence of an HBV DNA fragment covering these sites in HBsAg-positive blood donors (n = 160) and patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 66), liver cirrhosis (n = 45), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 58), most of whom were infected with genotype C HBV (subtype adr). In cases where HBe antigen was positive, the frequency of T1653 and/or V1753 showed a striking increment from chronic hepatitis patients (18%) to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatoma patients (82%), whereas that of T1762/A1764 was already high in chronic hepatitis patients (76%). In HBe antigen-negative cases, by contrast, significant difference in the frequency of T1653/V1753 mutants was found between blood donors (22%) and chronic hepatitis patients (67%). Our results suggest that T1653/V(particularly C)1753 mutants are more closely associated than T1762/A1764 with the progression of liver disease from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis in HBe antigen-positive patients. A system of site-directed mutagenesis PCR RFLP was constructed to diagnose T1653 and C/A1753 more conveniently. Detecting T1653 and C/A1753 by this method would contribute to the differential diagnosis of HBV-associated liver disease."

In the UK and Ireland, the number of patients who present with advanced HIV disease is increasing, with 301/977 (31%) of patients presenting late (<200 CD4 cells/mm(3)). Many patients who present with advanced HIV disease will have comorbid conditions, such as hepatitis B or C or tuberculosis (TB), which complicates the choice of therapy. This article reviews the evidence and some clinical scenarios for specific patient groups who may present with advanced HIV disease: those with comorbid TB, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. The aim is to offer practical advice on therapeutic options for treatment-naïve patients who present with advanced HIV disease on the basis of available clinical evidence."

No confirmed report of resistance selection during treatment with TDF in treatment-naïve and nucleoside/nucleotide analog-treated chronic hepatitis B patients has yet been reported. Here, we report for the first time a patient with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis who emerged with virologic breakthrough during combination therapy with TDF and entecavir (ETV), against ETV-resistant virus. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), whose genotype was C, received ETV monotherapy continuously followed by TDF and ETV combination therapy, because her HBV DNA levels had been >3.5 log copies/mL. At the start of combination therapy, amino acid substitutions of the reverse transcriptase (rt) gene, rtL180M, rtT184I/M, and rtM204V, were detected. After this, serum HBV DNA decreased to less than 2.1 log copies/mL and remained at this level until 31 months of combination therapy, when it again began to increase. Amino acid substitutions of rtL180M, rtS202G, and rtM204V emerged and were associated with an increase in serum HBV DNA at virologic breakthrough. Long-term therapy with TDF against the ETV-resistant virus has the potential to induce virologic breakthrough and resistance, and careful follow-up should be carried out. "
835,0.001,1.0000,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are also infected with HIV, and undergo antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Due to changes in HIV burden and immunologic status, HIV ARV treatment may have indirect effects on the HCV population, which could impact the effectiveness of subsequent HCV protease inhibitor (PI) treatment. The genetic variability of the protease-encoding HCV NS3 gene was evaluated in 10 co-infected patients initiating ARVs (both before and after ARV initiation), and compared to the genetic variability in 10 patients on stable ARV therapy. After RT-PCR of plasma-derived HCV RNA, a mean of 20 clones per patient time-point were sequenced and analyzed for changes in the HCV quasispecies population. No significant differences in sequence diversity or complexity at the nucleic acid or amino acid levels were seen at baseline between groups or between the two time points in either group. HCV protease diversity in the pre- and post-ARV treatment samples was not significantly different than samples from patients on stable ARV therapy. There was no significant development of amino acid substitutions known to confer HCV PI resistance in either group. Initiation of ARV for HIV infection does not significantly alter the genetic diversity or complexity of the HCV NS3 gene or result in increased number of HCV PI-associated amino acid changes. These results suggest ARV treatment for HIV would not affect the efficacy of HCV PI treatment."
125,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide, frequently leading to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence suggests that high viral antigen load may play a role in chronicity. Production of viral proteins is thought to depend on transcription of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In a human clinical trial with an RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutic targeting HBV transcripts, ARC-520, HBV S antigen (HBsAg) was strongly reduced in treatment-naïve patients positive for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) but was reduced significantly less in patients who were HBeAg-negative or had received long-term therapy with nucleos(t)ide viral replication inhibitors (NUCs). HBeAg positivity is associated with greater disease risk that may be moderately reduced upon HBeAg loss. The molecular basis for this unexpected differential response was investigated in chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that HBsAg was expressed not only from the episomal cccDNA minichromosome but also from transcripts arising from HBV DNA integrated into the host genome, which was the dominant source in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees. Many of the integrants detected in chimpanzees lacked target sites for the small interfering RNAs in ARC-520, explaining the reduced response in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees and, by extension, in HBeAg-negative patients. Our results uncover a heretofore underrecognized source of HBsAg that may represent a strategy adopted by HBV to maintain chronicity in the presence of host immunosurveillance. These results could alter trial design and endpoint expectations of new therapies for chronic HBV."
5780,0.001,1.0000,"The morphologic evolution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) liver disease in 45 hepatic allograft recipients who were HBV surface-antigen positive (HBs-Ag+) at the time of liver replacement and who survived for more than 60 days was studied by routine histologic and immunocytochemical analysis of serial pathology specimens. The findings in these patients were compared to a control group of 30 individuals who were immune to the HBV (anti-HBs antibody positive), but required hepatic replacement for other reasons. Eight of the forty-five (18%) HBsAg-positive patients have no serologic evidence of HBV reinfection after transplantation. All 37 remaining patients are reinfected; 21 (47%) developed chronic active hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, 3 (7%) developed submassive necrosis, and 6 (14%) developed chronic lobular hepatitis. One patient lost her graft to chronic rejection, despite reinfection with the B virus. Four other patients (9%) developed a chronic carrier state. No long-term follow-up biopsies were available in the remaining two patients. The histologic features associated with dysfunction related to recurrent HBV infection evolved from an acute to chronic phase and were similar to hepatitis B seen in nonallografted livers. Furthermore HBV-related lesions could be separated from rejection using routine histology alone. The only exception to this conclusion was the occurrence of a peculiar HBV-related lesion in two recipients, described herein. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in almost all cases. Hepatic inflammation also was commonly present during HBV disease and consisted mostly of accessory cells and T lymphocytes. Analysis of the effect of major histocompatibility complex matching revealed no clear association between the number of class I or II matches or mismatches and the development, or pattern, of active hepatitis in the allograft. Peculiar pathologic alterations in several of the biopsies and failed allografts after HBV reinfection suggests that, under special circumstances, the B virus may be cytopathic."

We have determined, in this study, that topical application of DNCB alone, even without induction of contact skin hypersensitivity, was sufficient to observe activation of the human immunodeficiency virus promoter (long terminal repeat) in the skin of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat-luciferase transgenic mouse model. Such treatment might be contra-indicative in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, because in earlier studies DNCB-exposed skin dendritic cells might migrate into draining lymph nodes which play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis."
6076,0.001,1.0000,"The transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 647 subjects who presented no apparent risk factors for the infection other than having had promiscuous heterosexual relations, heterosexual relations with people with an elevated risk of infection, or heterosexual relations with people infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty subjects were found to be seropositive for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The elevated risk factors included being the habitual partner of a person at risk of infection or of a person who was infected by human immunodeficiency virus, or being the partner of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The transmission of the virus was verified in 13 of 284 subjects (4.57%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons at risk and in 16 of 101 subjects (15.84%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. No significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus infection and a history of sexually transmitted infections, nor between human immunodeficiency virus infection and female subjects was found. These data suggest that the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can also spread through heterosexual relations, even if the possibility of becoming infected in this way seems at the moment limited to particular risk behaviors."
7242,0.001,1.0000,"The long terminal repeat (LTR) transcriptional promoters of different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 subtypes were inserted into the LAI molecular clone of subtype B. The viral genotypes represent seven subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and one circulating recombinant form (AG). We performed replication studies with this isogenic set of viruses across six cellular environments. This approach revealed strong cellular environment effects, but the method was not sensitive enough to detect small differences in the replication rate between the subtypes. By conducting pairwise competition experiments between the virus variants in six cellular environments, we could demonstrate significant differences in the replication rates of the subtypes and that LTR-determined viral fitness depends both on the host cell type and the activation state of the cell. In addition, we determined the degree of conservation of the transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in the different-subtype LTRs by analyzing sequences from the HIV sequence database. The sequence analyses revealed subtype-specific conservation of certain TFBS. The results indicate that one should consider the possibility of subtype-specific viral replication rates in vivo, which are strongly influenced by the host environment. We argue that the multidimensional host environment may have shaped the genetic structures of the subtype LTRs."
8697,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) is a significant source of disability in the HIV-infected population. Even with stringent adherence to anti-retroviral therapy, >50% of patients living with HIV-1 will develop HAND (Heaton et al., 2010). Because suppression of viral replication alone is not enough to stop HAND progression, there is a need for an adjunctive neuroprotective therapy in this population. To this end, we have developed a small-molecule brain-penetrant inhibitor with activity against mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), named URMC-099. MLK3 activation is associated with many of the pathologic hallmarks of HAND (Bodner et al., 2002, 2004; Sui et al., 2006) and therefore represents a prime target for adjunctive therapy based on small-molecule kinase inhibition. Here we demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of URMC-099 in multiple murine and rodent models of HAND. In vitro, URMC-099 treatment reduced inflammatory cytokine production by HIV-1 Tat-exposed microglia and prevented destruction and phagocytosis of cultured neuronal axons by these cells. In vivo, URMC-099 treatment reduced inflammatory cytokine production, protected neuronal architecture, and altered the morphologic and ultrastructural response of microglia to HIV-1 Tat exposure. In conclusion, these data provide compelling in vitro and in vivo evidence to investigate the utility of URMC-099 in other models of HAND with the goal of advancement to an adjunctive therapeutic agent."
4719,0.001,1.0000,"Amino acid substitutions at positions rtN238T/D of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase have been reported as potential mutations associated with adefovir (ADV) resistance. In this study, we characterized the prevalence of the rtN238H mutation and determined the susceptibility to LAM and ADV using phenotypic analyzes in vitro. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-five HBsAg-positive patients with chronic HBV (CHB) infection were included in this study. HBV genotypes and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations were determined by direct sequencing. Replication-competent HBV constructs containing the naturally occurring rtN238H mutation were generated and replication capacity and susceptibility to LAM and ADV in transiently transfected hepatoma cell lines were determined. Among 1865 enrolled HBV infected patients, 8.8% (165/1865) showed mutations in the rtN238 locus (143 males/22 females, 91 treatment-naive, 42 ADV-treated, 16 LAM-treated and 16 ADV+LAM-treated), namely 86% rtN238H (142/165), 5.5% rtN238S (9/165), 5.5% rtN238T (9/165) and 3% rtN238D (5/165). Among the rtN238H mutant strains, there were no significant differences between ADV- or/and LAM- treated patients and treated-naive patients (42% vs. 58%). Compared with wild-type HBV, this mutant displayed an equivalent susceptibility to LAM or ADV in phenotypic assays. Importantly, we found that the incidence rate of rtN238H was higher in HBV genotype B infected patients than HBV genotype C subsets (80.3% vs. 19.7%), even without exogenous selection pressures. As rtN238H did neither impair the viral replication efficiency nor susceptibility to LAM or ADV in vitro, rtN238H likely represents background polymorphisms rather than resistance mutations with clinical implications. The incidence of rtN238H may be associated with HBV genotype."

Membrane fluidity was assessed by fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, using the fluorescence probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-[4-(trimethylamino)-phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH). AChE activity was determined by the colorimetric Ellman's method and [Ca2(+)](int) using the fluorescent fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester. When compared with the control group, lymphocytes of infected patients presented significantly decreased membrane fluidity, decreased AChE activity, and increased [Ca2(+)](int). Erythrocytes from HIV-infected patients presented decreased [Ca2(+)](int) when compared with the control group and decreased membrane fluidity near the lipid/water interface. Our data show that HIV-1 infection leads to biochemical and biophysical changes in the membrane itself and in membrane protein activity in lymphocytes (average of infected and noninfected subpopulations) and even in erythrocytes. The present observations are in agreement with a process of facilitated propagation of the infection to new cells, stimulation of virion production, and maintenance of a reservoir of erythrocyte-bound infectious virus."
4360,0.001,1.0000,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."
2587,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity has been suggested to correlate with protection from progression to AIDS. We have examined the relationship between HIV-specific CTL activity and maintenance of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and control of viral load in 17 long-term survivors (LTSs) of HIV-1 infection. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the LTS cohort demonstrated a decreased rate of CD4+ T cell loss (18 cells/mm3/year) compared with typical normal progressors (approximately 60 cells/mm3/year). The majority of the LTSs had detectable, variable, and in some individuals, quite high (>10(4) RNA copies/ml) plasma viral load during the study period. In a cross-sectional analysis, HIV-specific CTL activity to HIV Gag, Pol, and Env proteins was detectable in all 17 LTSs. Simultaneous analysis of HIV-1 Gag-Pol, and Env-specific CTLs and virus load in protease inhibitor-naive individuals showed a significant inverse correlation between Pol-specific CTL activity and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (p = 0.001). Furthermore, using a mixed linear effects model the combined effects of HIV-1 Pol- and Env-specific CTL activity on the viral load were significantly stronger than the effects of HIV-1 Pol-specific CTL activity alone on predicted virus load. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1-specific CTL activity in HIV-1-infected long-term survivors is an important component in the effective control of HIV-1 replication."
8631,0.001,1.0000,"The pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome dementia complex (ADC) is still poorly understood. Many studies suggest that proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha released by microglia/macrophages or astrocytes play a role in CNS injury. A microscopic finding of a microglial nodule with multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs) is a histopathologic hallmark of ADC and named HIV encephalitis. However, in vivo expression of these cytokines in this microenvironment of HIV encephalitis is not yet clarified. One of the main reasons is complexities of brain pathology in patients who have died from terminal AIDS. In this study, we infected two macaques with macrophage-tropic Simian immunodeficiency virus SIV239env/MERT and examined expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in inflammatory lesions with MNGCs and its relation to virus-infected cells using immunohistochemistry. One macaque showed typical inflammatory lesions with MNGCs in the frontal white matter. Small microglial nodules were also detected in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord. SIVenv positive cells were detected mainly in inflammatory lesions, and seemed to be microglia/macrophages and MNGCs based on their morphology. Expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were detected in the inflammatory lesions with MNGCs, and these positive cells were found to be negative for SIVenv by double-labeling immunohistochemistry or immunohistochemistry of serial sections. There were a few TNF-alpha positive cells and almost no IL-1beta positive cells in the area other than inflammatory lesions. Another macaque showed scattered CD3+ cells and CD68+ cells in the perivascular regions of the white matter. SIVenv and TNF-alpha was demonstrated in a few perivascular macrophages. These findings indicate that virus-infected microglia/macrophages do not always express IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, which suggests an indirect role of HIV-1-infected cells in cytokine-mediated pathogenesis of ADC. Our macaque model for human ADC may be useful for better understanding of its pathogenesis."
1231,0.001,1.0000,"We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of single, oral doses of amprenavir (141W94; formerly VX-478), a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 protease, administered as hard gelatin capsules in 12 HIV-infected subjects. The doses of amprenavir evaluated were 150, 300, 600, 900, and 1,200 mg. Amprenavir was rapidly absorbed, with the time to maximum concentration occurring within 1 to 2 h after dosing. On the basis of power model analysis, the increase in the maximum concentration of amprenavir in plasma (Cmax) was less than dose proportional, and the increase in the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-infinity) was greater than dose proportional; mean slopes (with 90% confidence intervals) were 1.25 (1.16 to 1.35) and 0.78 (0.78 to 0.86) for AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively. Amprenavir was eliminated slowly, with a terminal-phase half-life of 8 h. A second study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of the hard gelatin capsule relative to that of a subsequently developed soft gelatin capsule. The capsules were bioequivalent in terms of AUC0-infinity but not in terms of Cmax; geometric-least-squares means ratios (with 90% confidence intervals) were 1.03 (0.92 to 1.14) and 1.25 (1.03 to 1. 53) for AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively. Administration of soft gelatin capsules of amprenavir with a high-fat breakfast resulted in a 14% decrease in the mean AUC0-infinity (from 9.58 to 8.26 microg. h/ml), which is not likely to be clinically significant. The most common adverse events related to amprenavir were headache, nausea, and hypesthesia. Amprenavir appears to be safe and well tolerated over the dose range of 150 to 1200 mg. On the basis of the present single-dose studies, amprenavir is an HIV protease inhibitor with favorable absorption and clearance pharmacokinetics that are only minimally affected by administration with food."
6768,0.001,1.0000,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
4890,0.001,1.0000,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."

A total of 21,198 patients who had infections refractory to zidovudine or who were intolerant of the drug received didanosine as a buffered powder for oral solution (sachet), with total daily doses of 6.6-10 mg/kg; the median CD4 lymphocyte count was 0.04 x 10(9)/L for this population. At the currently recommended dose (6.6-8.29 mg/[kg.d]), 6-month estimated rates of pancreatitis ranged from 1.2% for patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC) and CD4 lymphocyte counts of > or = 0.1 x 10(9)/L to 6.7% for patients with AIDS and CD4 lymphocyte counts of < 0.05 x 10(9)/L. Laboratory toxicities of World Health Organization grades 3 and 4 developed in fewer than 4% of patients entering the study with normal baseline values; the sole exception was leukopenia, which was documented in 8% of these patients. The results of this program demonstrated that patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts of < 0.10 x 10(9)/L or with a diagnosis of AIDS (defined by the 1987 classification system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were less tolerant of didanosine and significantly more likely to develop adverse clinical reactions and myelosuppression than other patients."

Of this total, 438 tested positive for HIV antibody (1.1%). Of these, 215 men returned for post test interview and physical exam and were compared with 1,348 men randomly selected HIV-1 seronegative men. None of the HIV-1 seropositive had a history of injecting drug use or had received blood transfusion in the past seven years. HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with the TPHA serological marker for syphylis > 1.160 (p = 0.015, odd ratio 1.8), history of urethritis (p = 0.009, odd ratio 1.92) (Table 4). This study found that HIV-1 seropositive men were mostly single, were likely to be from the rural northern provinces of Thailand or Bangkok. History of purchase of low-fee commercial sex and less condom use were significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity as was a history of STD in the year prior to interview. Information on HIV disease and pre-test/post test counselling is needed for Thai laborers who are applying for work abroad to countries which require HIV and syphylis screening. In this effort, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Public Health and the clinic for laborers going abroad should join forces to provide this service. This will serve to increase awareness and self-determination among an increasingly vulnerable segment of the population who also have the potential to spread HIV infection to their spouse and other sex partners.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1051,0.001,1.0000,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient in 2007 has the option to commence an antiretroviral regimen that is extremely efficacious in suppressing the virus and has few side effects. In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."
8427,0.001,1.0000,"In Taiwan, injecting drug use has been the main route of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The aim of this study is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 anti-HDV seronegative IDUs and 60 anti-HDV seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of anti-HDV seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68.9% (60/87). The prevalence rate of anti-HDV seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40.0% (12/30) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to anti-HDV seropositivity (odds ratio = 9.34, 95% confidence interval = 2.67-31.59, p < 0.001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with anti-HDV seronegativity and those with anti-HDV seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to anti-HDV seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and anti-HDV should be monitored closely."
8869,0.001,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become widely available in China during the past seven years. However, many patients still initiate treatment at very late stages. To understand the distribution of baseline CD4 and factors associated with late antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, the National Free ART Database was retrospectively reviewed and a total of 49,321 HIV/AIDS patients were identified in this study based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥18; (2) initiated HAART between 1 July, 2006 and 31 December, 2009; (3) have recorded baseline CD4 cell count. This study showed that although both the median and mean baseline CD4 increased consistently over the study period, there were still about 30% of HIV/AIDS patients accessing ART at a very late stage (CD4 ≤ 50 µl) in 2009. Risk factors for late ART access included being male, single, having a short time interval between HIV diagnosis and treatment, and being infected through heterosexual contact. Being infected through injection drug use and homosexual contact were protective. Transmission route and marriage status showed different effects in a gender stratified analysis. A strengthened HIV testing and screening program is the key to improving the accessibility of ART and populations that are vulnerable to sexual transmission of HIV should be the primary target of the program."
3005,0.001,1.0000,"The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection."
2870,0.001,1.0000,"Skin lesions are often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, reflecting the immunocompromised status of the individual. We investigated the relationship between skin lesions and immune function in a retrospective study of 796 Chinese HIV patients with and without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Of the 651 patients who had not received HAART, we found that 531 (81.6%) had apparent skin lesions. The incidence of infectious skin diseases (fungi, viruses, bacteria, spirochetes and parasites) and non-infectious skin diseases (excluding skin cancer) was 68.8% and 34.9%, respectively. Mean CD4(+) T-cell counts and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratios were lower in patients with skin lesions than in patients without lesions (178 ± 96/µl vs. 306 ± 189/µl (p < 0.05) and 0.22 vs. 0.34 (p < 0.01), respectively). Candidiasis (25.8%), eczema (19.2%), nodular prurigo (13.8%), dermatophyte infections (10.6%) and herpes zoster (9.4%) were most common in Chinese patients with HIV. Among the 145 patients who had started HAART, there was a significantly lower prevalence of skin diseases (29.0%), although drug eruptions (12.4%) were more commonly observed. These findings indicate that HAART often reduces the incidence of infectious and non-infectious skin lesions in patients with HIV, but can itself be the cause of drug eruptions."
6871,0.001,1.0000,"Interruption of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients leads to increased HIV replication and viral rebound in peripheral blood. Effects of therapy interruption on gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) have not been well investigated. We evaluated longitudinal changes in viral replication and emergence of viral variants in the context of T cell homeostasis and gene expression in GALT of three HIV-positive patients who initiated HAART during primary HIV infection but opted to interrupt therapy thereafter. Longitudinal viral sequence analysis revealed that a stable proviral reservoir was established in GALT during primary HIV infection that persisted through early HAART and post-therapy interruption. Proviral variants in GALT and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) displayed low levels of genomic diversity at all times. A rapid increase in viral loads with a modest decline of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood was observed, while gut mucosal CD4(+) T cell loss was severe following HAART interruption. This was accompanied by increased mucosal gene expression regulating interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses and immune activation, a profile similar to those found in HAART-naive HIV-infected patients. Sequence analysis of rebound virus suggested that GALT was not the major contributor to the postinterruption plasma viremia nor were GALT HIV reservoirs rapidly replaced by HIV rebound variants. Our data suggest an early establishment and persistence of viral reservoirs in GALT with minimal diversity. Early detection of and therapy for HIV infection may be beneficial in controlling viral evolution and limiting establishment of diverse viral reservoirs in the mucosal compartment."
4432,0.001,1.0000,"Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype C is associated with a prolonged viremic phase, delayed hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and an increased incidence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma compared with genotype B infection. Genotype C is also associated with the more frequent emergence of core promoter mutations, which increase genome replication and are independently associated with poor clinical outcomes. We amplified full-length HBV genomes from serum samples from Chinese and U. S. patients with chronic HBV infection and transfected circularized genome pools or dimeric constructs of individual clones into Huh7 cells. The two genotypes could be differentiated by Western blot analysis due to the reactivities of M and L proteins toward a monoclonal pre-S2 antibody and slightly different S-protein mobilities. Great variability in replication capacity was observed for both genotypes. The A1762T/G1764A core promoter mutations were prevalent in genotype C isolates and correlated with increased replication capacity, while the A1752G/T mutation frequently found in genotype B isolates correlated with a low replication capacity. Importantly, most genotype C isolates with wild-type core promoter sequence replicated less efficiently than the corresponding genotype B isolates due to less efficient transcription of the 3.5-kb RNA. However, genotype C isolates often displayed more efficient virion secretion. We propose that the low intracellular levels of viral DNA and core protein of wild-type genotype C delay immune clearance and trigger the subsequent emergence of A1762T/G1764A core promoter mutations to upregulate replication; efficient virion secretion compensates for the low replication capacity to ensure the establishment of persistent infection by genotype C."
2793,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are two highly variable RNA viruses that cause chronic infections in humans. Although HCV likely preceded the AIDS epidemic by some decades, the global spread of both viruses is a relatively recent event. Nevertheless, HCV global diversity is higher than that of HIV-1. To identify differences in mutant diversity, we compared the HIV-1 protease and HCV NS3 protease quasispecies. Three protease gene quasispecies samples per virus, isolated from a total of six infected patients, were genetically and phenotypically analyzed at high resolution (HIV-1, 308 individual clones; HCV, 299 clones). Single-nucleotide variant frequency did not differ between quasispecies from the two viruses (HIV-1, 2.4 × 10(-3) ± 0.4 × 10(-3); HCV, 2.1 × 10(-3) ± 0.5 × 10(-3)) (P = 0.1680). The proportion of synonymous substitutions to potential synonymous sites was similar (3.667 ± 0.6667 and 2.183 ± 0.9048, respectively) (P = 0.2573), and Shannon's entropy values did not differ between HIV-1 and HCV (0.84 ± 0.02 and 0.83 ± 0.12, respectively) (P = 0.9408). Of note, 65% (HIV-1) and 67% (HCV) of the analyzed enzymes displayed detectable protease activity, suggesting that both proteases have a similar mutational robustness. In both viruses, there was a rugged protease enzymatic activity landscape characterized by a sharp peak, representing the master sequence, surrounded by a collection of diverse variants present at lower frequencies. These results indicate that nucleotide quasispecies diversification during chronic infection is not responsible for the higher worldwide genetic diversity observed in HCV."
9457,0.001,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope contains equimolar amounts of three viral proteins: the major (S), middle, and large (L) polypeptides. Their roles in the adsorption and penetration of the virus have not yet been elucidated. We have used a highly efficient in vitro model that permits reproducible HBV infection to investigate whether N-myristylation, a posttranslational modification of the L protein, was essential for viral infectivity. A point mutation abolishing myristylation was introduced into the HBV genome. Mutant virions were produced by transfecting viral DNA into hepatoma cells and their infectivity was evaluated on primary human hepatocyte cultures. No difference between mutant and wild-type viral RNA production could be observed. Furthermore, intermediate DNA replicative forms were observed in transfected cells demonstrating replication competence of mutant viral genomes. In addition, complete virions were produced in the cell supernatant. However, we found that mutant viral particles contained viral DNA with a reduced mean size, probably corresponding to a larger single-stranded region in the relaxed circular DNA form. We have evidenced the presence of pre-S1, pre-S2, and S epitopes at the outer surface of these virions by using immunoprecipitation with specific monoclonal antibodies. This result confirmed that mutant viruses were normally assembled. By contrast, myristylation-defective mutants completely lost their infectivity for human hepatocytes in primary cultures as shown by the absence of HBs antigen production and viral intermediate replicative forms in hepatocytes. In conclusion, the myristylation of the L protein is not required for the production of Dane-like particles but it is absolutely necessary for HBV infectivity."
1392,0.001,1.0000,"One of the serious sequelae of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among all the proteins encoded by the HBV genome, hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is highly associated with the development of HCC. Although Notch1 signaling has been found to exert a tumor-suppressive function during HCC development, the mechanism of interaction between HBx expression and Notch1 signaling needs to be explored. In this study, we report that HBx expression in hepatic and hepatoma cells resulted in decreased endogenous protein levels of Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) and messenger RNA levels of its downstream target genes. These effects were due to a reduction of Notch1 cleavage by HBx through the suppression of presenilin1 (Psen1) transcription rather than inhibition of Notch1 transcription or its ligands' expression. Through transient HBx expression, decreased ICN1 resulted in enhanced cell proliferation, induced G1-S cell cycle progression, and blunted cellular senescence in vitro. Furthermore, the effect of blunted senescence-like growth arrest by stable HBx expression through suppression of ICN1 was shown in a nude mouse xenograft transplantation model. The correlation of inhibited Psen1-dependent Notch1 signaling and blunted senescence-like growth arrest was also observed in HBV-associated HCC patient tumor samples."
974,0.001,1.0000,"Zimbabwe is a high prevalence area for HIV infection, and provides opportunities for studying complications of AIDS in both antiretroviral naive and treated groups of patients. Figures for HIV prevalence are among the highest in the world, but the number of people receiving treatment is very small. Economic and political factors contribute to this important health crisis. Opportunistic diseases as a whole and their relative frequencies of presentation in southern Africa are discussed, emphasizing the lead role of tuberculosis. The limited data that do exist regarding neurological complications in Zimbabwe are summarized, and combined with anecdotal experience from practicing clinicians. Opportunistic infections in the nervous system are very common, the most important being cryptococcal meningitis, causing half of all adult meningitis in the country. Tuberculous and bacterial meningitis have also become more common and carry a high mortality in HIV-infected people in Zimbabwe. Intracranial mass lesions, including tuberculoma, bacterial abscesses and toxoplasmosis encephalitis are less common and difficult to diagnose in the absence of stereotactic biopsy. Spinal tuberculosis and transverse myelitis are the most frequent causes of spinal cord opportunistic infections. Peripheral neuropathy is probably similar in presentation to that seen elsewhere, whereas dementia is less frequently recognized."
198,0.001,1.0000,"Antiviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through daily drug administration can protect healthy individuals from HIV-1 infection. While PrEP was recently approved by the FDA, the potential long-term consequences of PrEP implementation remain entirely unclear. The aim of this study is to predict the efficacy of different prophylactic strategies with the pro-drug tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF) and to assess the sensitivity towards timing- and mode of TDF administration (daily- vs. single dose), adherence and the number of transmitted viruses. We developed a pharmacokinetic model for TDF and its active anabolite tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and validated it with data from 4 different trials, including 4 distinct dosing regimes. Pharmacokinetics were coupled to an HIV model and viral decay following TDF mono-therapy was predicted, consistent with available data. Subsequently, a stochastic approach was used to estimate the % infections prevented by (i) daily TDF-based PrEP, (ii) one week TDF started either shortly before, or -after viral exposure and (iii) a single dose oral TDF before viral challenge (sd-PrEP). Analytical solutions were derived to assess the relation between intracellular TFV-DP concentrations and prophylactic efficacy. The predicted efficacy of TDF was limited by a slow accumulation of active compound (TFV-DP) and variable TFV-DP half-life and decreased with increasing numbers of transmitted viruses. Once daily TDF-based PrEP yielded [Formula: see text]80% protection, if at least 40% of pills were taken. Sd-PrEP with 300 mg or 600 mg TDF could prevent [Formula: see text]50% infections, when given at least before virus exposure. The efficacy dropped to [Formula: see text]10%, when given 1 h before 24 h exposure. Efficacy could not be increased with increasing dosage or prolonged administration. Post-exposure prophylaxis poorly prevented infection. The use of drugs that accumulate more rapidly, or local application of tenofovir gel may overcome the need for drug administration long before virus exposure."

The use of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 in obese patients with type 2 diabetes on HIV retroviral as an alternative to insulin therapy is not documented; we report the case of a 47-year-old treated with exenatide when insulin was discontinued. During the first year of treatment, exenatide, in combination with metformin and repaglinide, led to a weight loss of 14 kg and fat mass and waist circumference were respectively reduced from 31 to 25.5% and from 114 to 103 cm. Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) was used to calculate β-cell secretion which increased from 50 to 78% and insulin sensitivity which increased from 28 to 51%, reflecting a decrease in HbA(1c) by 1.9%. Exenatide may be a new therapeutic option for HIV-infected type 2 diabetes patients undergoing retroviral therapy."
6241,0.001,1.0000,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."
1094,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a risk factor for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We sought whether a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13, the enzyme specifically involved in the cleavage of von Willebrand factor, was associated with specific presenting features and outcome in HIV-associated TMA. In this prospective, multicentre, case-control study, 29 patients of 236 in the French Network on TMA had an HIV-associated TMA. Seventeen patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (ADAMTS13 <5% HIV(+) group) were compared to 12 patients with a detectable ADAMTS13 activity (ADAMTS13 >or=5% HIV(+) group). HIV(+) patients were also compared to 62 patients with idiopathic TMA, either with (45 patients, ADAMTS13 <5% idiopathic group) or without (17 patients, ADAMTS13 >or=5% idiopathic group) severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. ADAMTS13 <5% HIV(+) patients had less AIDS-related complications than ADAMTS13 >or=5% HIV(+) patients (23.5% versus 91.6%, respectively, P = 0.0005) and their median CD4(+) T cell count was higher (P = 0.05). TMA-associated death rate was higher in ADAMTS13 >or=5% HIV(+) patients than in ADAMTS13 <5% HIV(+) patients (50% versus 11.7%, respectively, P = 0.04). In ADAMTS13 <5% patients, TMA-associated death rate was comparable between HIV(+) and idiopathic patients (15.5% in idiopathic patients, P-value was non-significant). By contrast, TMA-associated death rate in ADAMTS13 >or=5% HIV(+) patients was higher than in idiopathic patients (11.7% in idiopathic patients, P = 0.04). In conclusion, HIV-associated TMA with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency have less AIDS-related complications and a higher CD4(+) T cell count. TMA prognosis is better and comparable to this of idiopathic forms."
766,0.001,1.0000,"There is no consensus regarding the specific management of HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome. We report a child whose first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was nephropathy and wasting syndrome associated with profound immunodeficiency. The patient had a dramatic clinical and immunologic response to triple antiretroviral therapy delivered through a gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of nephrotic syndrome. A 51/2-year-old African-American girl presented with a 2-week history of cough, chest pain, vomiting, loose stools, abdominal distention, anorexia, and fever. In addition, she had recurrent oral thrush. Her weight and height were below the 5th percentile. She was chronically ill, appearing with oropharyngeal thrush and pitting edema in lower extremities. She had scattered rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on both lung bases. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. A chest radiograph showed consolidation of the right upper and left lower lobes with bilateral pleural effusion. Admission laboratories were consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew from the blood culture and the child responded well to treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. She was found to be HIV-infected, her CD4(+) cell count was 3 cells/mcL and her plasma HIV-1 RNA was >750 000 copies/mL. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed for supplemental nutrition. She was treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir via gastrostomy tube with good clinical response. Twenty-one months after instituting antiretroviral therapy, her weight and height had increased to the 50th and 10th percentile respectively, and she had complete resolution of her nephrotic syndrome. Her CD4(+) cell count increased to 1116 cells/mcL and her viral load has remained undetectable. HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been described in children with profound immunodeficiency. The course of untreated HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome is rapid progression to renal failure in up to 40% of the children. Regardless of the presence of renal insufficiency, if untreated, it is uniformly fatal. A modest improvement of HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with zidovudine. Steroid and cyclosporine treatment have resulted in improved renal function but long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy has raised concerns about safety. We have described, to our knowledge, the first child with HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome who had a remarkable clinical, immunologic, and virologic response to triple-drug combination therapy given by gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of proteinuria and normalization of the serum albumin. She also had a striking improvement in weight, height, and quality-of-life. Whether the presence of a gastrostomy tube contributed to the excellent response because of improved compliance is unknown, but warrants systematic evaluation."
1456,0.001,1.0000,"In untreated, asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, elevated serum concentrations of soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR) types I and II are associated with progression to AIDS. To assess the utility of sTNFRs as markers for the assessment of antiretroviral treatment, sTNFRs were sequentially determined in 47 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men, who participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Progression to AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex occurred in six zidovudine (ZDV)- and six placebo-treated subjects. During ZDV treatment (n = 28) both types of sTNFRs declined compared with baseline and placebo, whereas they increased during placebo treatment (n = 19). A sustained decline of sTNFRs occurred only in subjects who experienced no disease progression. During the first 3 months of ZDV treatment, the hazard ratio for disease progression when sTNFR type II rose above the baseline value plus 5% was significantly increased (hazard ratio: approximately 25; 95% confidence interval: approximately 1.5-400; p < 0.03). Simultaneously determined CD4+ counts and serum neopterin levels showed a similar pattern in progressors and nonprogressors. Thus, in contrast to CD4+ counts and neopterin levels, sTNFR concentrations, especially those of the type II STNFR, appear to be valuable surrogate markers for monitoring the efficacy of ZDV treatment in asymptomatic HIV-1 infection."
8498,0.001,1.0000,"INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the consequences of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. The disease increases the risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and death and complicates antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of CKD in HIV-1-infected patients is difficult to estimate and depends on the diagnostic criteria for CKD. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of a single measurement of serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in the diagnosis of kidney damage in patients infected with HIV-1.  PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 119 HIV-1-infected individuals (88 males [74%]), both on antiretroviral treatment and treatment-naive, with a negative history of kidney disease, and 31 healthy volunteers. We analyzed demographic characteristics as well as data on concomitant diseases, antiretroviral regimen, serum ADMA concentrations, parameters of renal function, CD4+ cell count, and HIV-1 viral load. RESULTS No significant impairment of renal function was observed. Mean serum ADMA levels in all HIV-1-infected patients, as well as in treatment-naive patients and treated patients, were significantly higher (P <0.0001; P = 0.0001; P <0.0001; respectively) compared with those in the control group. The difference between treatment-naive and treated HIV-1-infected patients was nonsignificant. ADMA levels were not correlated with the mean duration of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral drugs used, or other risk factors for CKD. CONCLUSIONS A single measurement of ADMA levels is not useful for the diagnosis of CKD in patients without significant renal pathology or as an indicator of kidney damage related to antiretroviral therapy. The significance of repeated measurements of ADMA levels in renal function assessment requires further research."
2301,0.001,1.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
5064,0.001,1.0000,"The clinical symptoms of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include severe liver damage, which is associated with the elimination of the HBV‑infected cells by the immune system. It has been suggested that suppression of HBV replication is not sufficient for patients with hepatitis B and the damaged liver function requires restoration. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined with short hairpin (sh)RNA to treat liver injury and suppress HBV replication in a mouse model. Lx‑shRNA157‑1694 (an shRNA expression plasmid containing two shRNA expression cassettes) and mouse immortal (mi)MSCs stably expressing shRNA (miMSC‑shRNA) were constructed and their suppressive effects on HBV expression were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR), ELISA and immunofluorescence. Hepatogenic differentiation of miMSC‑shRNA was induced in vitro and confirmed by morphology, reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative and ‑quantitative PCR, urea production and Periodic acid‑Schiff staining analyses. miMSCs and the shRNA expression plasmid alone or combined with miMSCs stably expressing shRNA were injected into mice. The former therapeutic regimen successfully suppressed HBV expression in sera and liver tissue, whereas the latter only suppressed HBV expression in liver tissue. Analyses of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, liver weight/body weight ratio percentage and sirius red staining demonstrated marked amelioration of liver injury in mice treated with both therapeutic regimens. The results of the present study suggest that miMSCs combined with shRNA treatment may alleviate liver injury and suppress HBV expression, thus providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver injury induced by HBV infection."

The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of previous or occult HBV infection in a cohort of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with histologically advanced chronic hepatitis C in the United States who did or did not develop HCC. Stored sera from 91 patients with HCC and 182 matched controls who participated in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody, and HBV DNA. Frozen liver samples from 28 HCC cases and 55 controls were tested for HBV DNA by way of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Anti-HBc (as a marker of previous HBV infection) was present in the serum of 41.8% HCC cases and 45.6% controls (P=0.54); anti-HBc alone was present in 16.5% of HCC cases and 24.7% of controls. HBV DNA was detected in the serum of only one control subject and no patients with HCC.

841,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is a recently discovered RNA virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Although HGV infection is usually not associated with elevated serum transaminases, some recent studies have reported that HGV infection is found in a significant number of patients with fulminant hepatitis and may play a role in its etiopathogenesis. In this study the prevalence of HGV infection was determined in 500 healthy blood donors and in 24 patients admitted to hospital because of acute liver failure caused by fulminant hepatitis. The presence of HGV RNA was tested in sera, obtained at admission and before any transfusion was given, by a sensitive seminested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for detection of the non-structural (NS)5 region. Nine of the 500 blood donors (1.8%) and two of the 24 patients (8.3%) were found to be HGV RNA positive. One patient was co-infected with HCV and was known to be an intravenous (i.v.) drug user. After intensive supporting treatment, this patient recovered completely. The second patient had no serological markers of known viral hepatitis infection, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). This patient was successfully transplanted. From both patients, from HGV RNA-positive healthy blood donors and from other patients coinfected with HCV, a part of the HGV NS3 region (nucleotides 4191-4345, EMBL entry U45966) was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparison revealed that the NS3 region of HGV in patients with fulminant hepatitis contained three nucleotide substitutions as part of the six substitutions described in previous work. These nucleotide substitutions were not found in the tested blood donors or in patients with HCV co-infection. Our findings therefore support the concept of the association of fulminant hepatitis with infection of a specific HGV strain."
6839,0.001,1.0000,"Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept, formally AG1343) is a potent and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (K(i) = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M8) and 3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxynelfinavir (M1). Antiviral assays with HIV-1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of nelfinavir, M8, and M1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC50 against another HIV-1 strain, IIIB, in MT-2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M8, whereas an approximately 5- to 11-fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M1. The active metabolite, M8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98%). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1.73 to 4.96 microM and the M8 concentrations ranged from 0.55 to 1.96 microM, whereas the M1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.19 microM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease."
1444,0.001,1.0000,"The novel 2'-deoxyguanosine analog Entecavir (ETV) is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and is recommended for treatment in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HBV-co-infected patients because it had been reported that ETV is HBV-specific. Recent clinical observations, however, have suggested that ETV may indeed demonstrate anti-HIV-1 activity. To investigate this question at a molecular level, kinetic studies were used to examine the interaction of 5'-triphosphate form of ETV with wild type (WT) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutation M184V. Using single turnover kinetic assays, we found that HIV-1 WT RT and M184V RT could use the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite as a substrate for incorporation. The mutant displayed a slower incorporation rate, a lower binding affinity, and a lower incorporation efficiency with the 5'-triphosphate form of ETV compared with WT RT, suggesting a kinetic basis for resistance. Our results are supported by cell-based assays in primary human lymphocytes that show inhibition of WT HIV-1 replication by ETV and decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation. This study has important therapeutic implications as it establishes ETV as an inhibitor for HIV-1 RT and illustrates the mechanism of resistance by the M184V mutant."
2604,0.001,1.0000,"It has become clear that the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome follows continuous replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a decrease in immune capability, most obviously a decline in the number of CD4 lymphocytes. An understanding of key elements in the infectious life cycle of HIV has led to the development of potent antiretroviral drugs selectively targeting unique reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes of the virus. Completed clinical trials have shown that antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, begun early, reduces viral replication and reverses the decline in CD4 lymphocyte numbers. Recent studies of combination therapies have shown that decreases in plasma HIV viremia to low levels and sustained increases in CD4 cell numbers are associated with longer survival. Potent combination regimens including protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors suppress detectable viral replication and have demonstrated clinical benefits in patients with advanced disease. Progress in antiretroviral therapy and methods to monitor responses to treatment are providing new hope in the treatment of HIV infection."
5998,0.001,1.0000,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
5594,0.001,1.0000,"Possible pathophysiological, clinical and epidemiological interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tropical pathogens, especially malaria parasites, constitute a concern in tropical areas. Two decades of research have shown that HIV-related immunosuppression is correlated with increased malaria infection, burden, and treatment failure, and with complicated malaria, irrespective of immune status. The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, which is used to prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial prophylactic properties, despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine-artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity. Recent in vivo observations have confirmed that protease inhibitors have strong antimalarial properties. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether-lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients. These observations show that those accessing care for HIV infection are now, paradoxically, well protected from malaria. These findings therefore highlight the need for confirmatory diagnosis of malaria in HIV-infected individuals receiving these interventions, and the provision of different artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria only when the diagnosis is confirmed."

The research design consisted of before and during therapy measurements with a median treatment period of 100 days (range, 50 to 188) in frozen samples. The subjects included 17 consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients (15 men and 2 women; 25 to 65-years-old). Controls were 42 healthy individuals (28 men and 14 women; 24- to 82-years-old) without serologic evidence of HIV and/or hepatitis C infection and normal clinical chemistry. Subjects received treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors, azidothymidine (AZT) or stavudine (D4T) plus lamivudine (3TC) and either the protease inhibitors, indinavir (IND), nelfinavir (NELF), ritonavir (RITV), or saquinavir (SAQ) at the standard dosage. Serum concentrations of methionine, total homocysteine (tHcy), cystathionine (CYSTA), N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG), N-methylglycine (MG), methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total cysteine, as well as vitamin B6, folate, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor p75 were taken at baseline and during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Baseline, serum tHcy, MMA, CYSTA, vitamin B6 concentrations were not significantly different from healthy controls. There was, however, a trend towards lower folate serum concentrations at baseline in HIV-infected patients as compared with healthy controls (P =.06). There were no significant correlations between tHcy and vitamin B6, folate, or MMA. Elevated baseline levels of DMG and MG decreased significantly during antiretroviral therapy (P =.0019 and.04, respectively), whereas no significant changes in serum concentrations of CYSTA, MMA, or methionine were detected. tHcy increased in 12 of 17 patients (P =.09). HIV-infected patients displayed significant alterations (elevated DMG and MG serum concentrations) in metabolite levels of the betaine pathway in methionine metabolism, which might be positively influenced by newly initiated antiretroviral combination therapy."

Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."
2586,0.001,1.0000,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
9934,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV exhibits extensive genetic diversity and it is apparent that an infected individual contains different populations of distinct viral strains, a large proportion of which has been found surprisingly to be defective for replication. A similar phenomenon has also been observed with some cell lines that are known to produce infectious viral particles but harbor defective proviral genomes. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this phenomenon by cloning proviral genomes of HIV from a cell line that was capable of producing high titers of biologically active HIV particles that readily induced syncytia with CD4+ cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This cell line was found to contain five proviral genomes, all of which, when tested individually, failed to produce replication-competent viruses upon transfection into human cells. However, when a specific combination of two proviral genomes was used in such transfection studies, it was possible to obtain biologically active, replication-competent viral particles that infected and replicated in CD4+ cell lines and induced syncytia characteristic of HIV. Such a result may be due to homologous recombination between proviral DNAs occurring in cells after transfection and/or complementation of replication-defective proviral DNAs. The diploid nature of the viral RNA genome present in the viral particle may enable the persistence of defective HIV genomes."
8989,0.001,1.0000,"Distal leg epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD) is a validated predictor of HIV sensory neuropathy (SN) risk. We assessed how ENFD is impacted by initiation of first-time antiretroviral therapy (ART) in subjects free of neuropathy and how it is altered when mitochondrial toxic nucleoside medications are used as part of ART. Serial changes in proximal thigh and distal leg ENFD were examined over 72 weeks in 150 Thai subjects randomized to a regimen of stavudine (d4T) switching to zidovudine (ZDV) at 24 weeks vs ZDV vs tenofovir (TDF) for the entire duration of study, all given in combination with nevirapine. We found individual variations in ENFD change, with almost equal number of subjects who decreased or increased their distal leg ENFD over 72 weeks and no relationship to nucleoside backbone or to development of neuropathic signs or symptoms. Lower baseline distal leg ENFD and greater increases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I (CI) activity were associated with larger increases in distal leg ENFD over 72 weeks. Distal leg ENFD correlated with body composition parameters (body surface area, body mass index, height) as well as with blood pressure measurements. Assessed together with a companion cross-sectional study, we found that mean distal leg ENFD in all HIV+ subjects was lower than in HIV- subjects but similar among HIV+ groups whether ART-naïve or on d4T with/without neuropathy/neuropathic symptoms. The utility of ENFD as a useful predictor of small unmyelinated nerve fiber damage and neuropathy risk in HIV may be limited in certain populations."
3477,0.001,1.0000,"Injection drug use has been the most growing rout of drug abuse in Iran in the past decade and it has been responsible for the transmission of HIV virus in more than two third of cases. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B in a group of IDU cadavers and to compare the results to a group of cadavers of the normal population. In a case-control study the blood samples of the cadavers of 400 randomly chosen IDUS and 400 other cadavers as control group were checked for HBS antigen and Anti HIV antibody in the forensic medicine center of Tehran. The prevalence of HIV and HBV infection was compared in two groups according to their demographic characteristics. The number of HIV and HBV positive cadavers was significantly higher in the IDU group than the controls (6.25% vs 0.5%, P<0.001, 27.5% vs 3%, P<0.001). The risk of getting infected by HIV virus was 13.27 times greater in the IDU group and the risk of HBV infection was 12.26 times greater in this group as compared to the control group. The age distribution of IDU cadavers indicated that the percentage of IDU cadavers in the reproductive (21-40 years old) age was 80%. The greater prevalence of the HIV and HBV infection especially in the reproductive age of IDUS indicates a greater concern to the authorities for more attention to prevention and harm reduction programs."
1884,0.001,1.0000,"A small population of HIV-1-infected individuals remains clinically healthy and immunologically normal for more than ten years. We have studied ten subjects who have been asymptomatic with normal and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, despite 12 to 16 years of HIV-1 infection, to gain information on the determinants of nonprogression. Multiple methods were used to determine the viral load in their blood. Plasma cultures were uniformly negative for infectious virus. However, particle-associated HIV-1 RNA was detectable in four subjects using a sensitive branched DNA amplification assay. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), infectious HIV-1 was quantified in three subjects using a standard limiting-dilution culture method. Infectious virus was recovered from another subject using a CD8-depleted culture. In contrast, six subjects had no detectable infectious virus in PBMC. All had detectable viral DNA in PBMC by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, but the copy numbers were low, ranging from 10 to 100 copies per 10(6) PBMC in all but two subjects. Overall, the viral burden in the plasma and PBMC of long-term survivors was orders of magnitude lower than those typically found in progressors. Possible mechanisms for low levels of HIV-1 in vivo were examined experimentally."
8102,0.001,1.0000,"To identify factors that cause HIV-1 to establish perivascular foci of infected cells, we studied the transendothelial migration of blood mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) from 76 HIV+ patients and 41 controls. The fraction of patients' lymphocytes that migrated across endothelial cell monolayers in vitro was significantly increased (p < or = 0.03) compared with that of control donors. Migration of patients' CD4+ T cells was particularly enhanced, whereas the migration of monocytes did not differ between patients and controls. Lymphocyte migration correlated with expression of CD11a/CD18 and CD49d/CD29 and with the quantity of TNF-alpha produced as MNLs migrated through the endothelium. Measurement of HIV-1 proviral DNA copies in the patients' MNLs (n = 26) suggested that in half the cases virus-infected cells accumulated preferentially amidst the migratory leukocytes. We observed the same behavior with normal donor MNLs infected, in vitro, with each of 4 strains of HIV-1. The number of HIV-1 proviral DNA copies per million MNLs was 40 to 178 times higher in the migratory population than in the original population added to the endothelium. To test whether only certain strains of HIV-1 stimulate transendothelial migration of infected cells, we used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to identify quasispecies of HIV-1 in the MNLs. If all strains of HIV-1 were equal in their ability to stimulate transendothelial migration, we expected to find no differences in the quasispecies present in the original and migratory cell populations. In fact the quasispecies differed in 14 of 19 paired samples, suggesting that only certain HIV-1 quasispecies promote transendothelial migration of infected cells."
3289,0.001,1.0000,"There are sparse epidemiologic data on coinfection of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5). Independent associations with HBV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection were age ≤ 50 years, male sex, positive HIV status, history of hemophilia, sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, history of blood transfusion, cocaine and other drug use; there was decreased risk in patients of Hispanic ethnicity."
2491,0.001,1.0000,The course of neurosyphilis has been reported to be altered by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Prior reports of neurosyphilis occurring in association with HIV infection have been largely anecdotal and have failed to compare neurosyphilis in patients with HIV infection with an uninfected control group. This study was performed to determine if the clinical presentation encountered is different in the presence of HIV infection.
3368,0.001,1.0000,"Binding of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) external envelope glycoprotein (gp120) has been reported to alter the function and surface antigen expression of lymphocytes and monocytes in vitro. To determine whether these in vitro findings could be relevant in vivo, we searched for the presence of this antigen in the serum of patients with AIDS and the AIDS-related complex (ARC). Using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with polyclonal anti-gp120 antibody, we detected envelope antigens (gp160/120) in serum of 22 of 32 AIDS patients. In contrast, an ELISA using solid-phase recombinant CD4 to capture gp160/120 failed to detect any positives. A modification of the anti-gp120-based ELISA identified gp160/120-IgG immune complexes in all of 11 AIDS patients tested and in 4 ARC patients who were negative for gp160/120 antigen. We conclude that gp160/120, predominantly in the form of immune complexes, can be identified as circulating antigen in patients with AIDS. The potential pathogenic consequences of this antigenemia, its relation to soluble CD4 therapy, and its application as a clinical marker of disease merit further study."
2589,0.001,1.0000,"The phenomenon of post-traumatic stress has been well documented in the literature as a lasting mental health condition associated with exposure to traumatic life events. The diagnosis and experience of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease may be such a trauma. On the other hand, the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been described, whereby people show positive mental health growth in the face of such trauma. This systematic review was set out to explore post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and PTG in people with HIV to monitor prevalence, measurement and efficacy of interventions to reduce stress and/or promote growth. Standardised review techniques were used to track reports on both PTSD and PTG. A total of 206 papers were retrieved from the PTSD and HIV searches, and 13 from the PTG and HIV searches. After reviewing the papers for inclusion according to adequacy and relevance criteria and to remove duplicates, 33 PTSD papers and three PTG were available for full coding. Prevalence of PTSD in HIV ranged from 5% to 74%, which were much greater than the 7-10% in the general population. Seven studies showed a relation between trauma and PTSD, while six showed a link between PTSD diagnosis and reduced antiretroviral treatment adherence. Women were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD. Only three intervention reports were identified that fitted our inclusion criteria. All of these reported on psychological interventions for HIV+ individuals with trauma. The interventions utilised HIV education, training in coping techniques and support groups. Only coping interventions were shown to be effective. PTG was under researched but showed a promising avenue of study. There needs to be harmonised measurement and the evidence base would need strengthening in order to build on the understanding of the impact of PTSD and PTG over the course of HIV disease. There is good evidence to associate HIV diagnosis and experiences during the course of illness as traumatic. PTSD has been shown to be prevalent and there seems to be good evidence to incorporate standardised measures to track the course of the disorder. There is extremely limited evidence that interventions may affect the course of symptom experience. The evidence and insight into PTG show promise but is currently inadequate."
2650,0.001,1.0000,"Plasma levels of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) are elevated during the course of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the molecule has an impact on virus replication. This study investigated the mode of cell death and release of HMGB1 during HIV-1 infection in vitro. MT4 cells and primary CD4(+) T cells were infected with HIV-1 isolates, and HMGB1 release was monitored in relation to cytopathic effects (CPE) and apoptosis. HMGB1 release from cells was analysed by Western blotting. For MT4 cells, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay was adapted to measure the release during necrosis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was quantified using a commercial assay. Flow cytometry was used to determine the level of infection and apoptosis. MT4 cells were > or =90 % infected at 48 h post-infection (p.i.). CPE was first observed at 60 h and correlated with release of HMGB1, LDH activity and caspase-3 (C3) activation. HMGB1 spots were clearly detected by ELISPOT assay at 72 h p.i. Annexin V and C3 staining showed that apoptosis was substantially involved in HIV-1-related cell death. Addition of Z-VAD (a caspase inhibitor) in a single dose at 24 or 40 h p.i. decreased both the number of caspase-positive cells and the release of HMGB1. Infection of primary CD4(+) T cells showed a 22 % (median) infection rate at 96 h. Related CPE corresponded to LDH and HMGB1 release. Both necrosis and apoptosis contributed to HMGB1 liberation during HIV-1-induced cell death and the protein could induce tumour necrosis factor-alpha release from peripheral mononuclear blood cells. These data imply that passive HMGB1 release contributes to the excessive immune activation characteristic of HIV-1 pathogenesis."
874,0.001,1.0000,"Whether critically ill human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at risk of acquiring nosocomial infections and resistant or potentially resistant microorganisms (RPRMs) remains to be clarified. The aim was to compare the acquisition of RPRMs, infections and mortality in critically ill HIV-infected and non-infected patients. An observational, prospective cohort study of patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) was undertaken. Swabbing of nares, pharynx and rectum, and culture of respiratory secretions were obtained within 48 h of admission and thrice weekly thereafter. Clinical samples were obtained as deemed necessary by the attending physician. Clinical variables, severity scores on admission and exposures during ICU stay were collected. Logistic regression was used to evaluate ICU mortality. Out of the 969 included patients, 64 (6.6%) were HIV-infected. These patients had a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score on admission (19.5 ± 6.6 vs. 21.1 ± 5.4, p = 0.02), stayed longer in the care unit and were more exposed to several invasive devices and antibiotics. There were no differences in the rate of acquisition of RPRMs and the only difference in ICU-acquired infections was a significantly higher incidence of catheter-related bacteraemia (3% vs. 9%, p = 0.03). The ICU-related mortality was similar in both groups (14% vs. 16%, p = 0.70) and in HIV-infected patients, it tended to be associated with a lower CD4 cell count (p = 0.06). Despite a longer ICU stay, critically ill HIV-infected patients did not show a higher rate of RPRMs acquisition. The rate of ICU-acquired infection was similar between HIV-infected and non-infected patients, except for catheter-related bacteraemia, which was higher in the HIV-infected population. Mortality was similar in both groups."
4264,0.001,1.0000,"Given the enormous advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), it is clear that early identification and treatment of all pregnant women with HIV is the best way to prevent neonatal infection and also improve women's health. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the course of infection is beneficial for individuals infected with HIV and reduces the rate of sexual transmission to partners who are not infected. Screening should be performed after women have been notified that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant patients and that they will receive an HIV test as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt-out screening). Obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric providers should follow opt-out prenatal HIV screening where legally possible. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and women known to be at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening on labor and delivery using the opt-out approach where allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement. "
9921,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) was studied using a second-generation ELISA test in 121 patients with self-limiting acute hepatitis B, including 63 intravenous drug addicts (IVDA). Within the first month after the onset of illness, 47.1% of the patients were anti-HCV positive, this figure reaching 52.1% six months later. The prevalence in the sixth month was significantly higher in the IVDA (93.6%) than in the non-IVDA (6.9%) (p < 0.00001). Among the IVDA, anti-HCV was more frequent in those with (100%) than in those without hepatitis delta virus (HDV) coinfection (84.6%) (p = 0.004). Of the 63 anti-HCV positive patients, 36 (57.1%) continued to exhibit abnormal transaminase levels for more than six months, while this was not observed in anti-HCV negative patients. These results show a high prevalence of infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) in IVDA with acute B hepatitis. As a rule, infection by HCV occurred prior to the hepatitis B infection, although occasionally simultaneous infections were observed. HCV appears to be the agent responsible for chronic liver disease in patients with acute B hepatitis who become HBsAg negative."
2166,0.001,1.0000,"To evaluate the occurrence of hepatotoxicity in patients during antiretroviral therapy (ART) that contains protease inhibitors and the role of hepatitis viruses in its development, we performed a retrospective study including 1325 HIV-infected patients treated with ART for at least 6 months. Presence or absence of hepatitis viruses, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, CD4 cell count, and plasma HIV RNA levels were evaluated. Hepatotoxicity developed in a few study subjects without coinfection, whereas it was significantly higher in coinfected patients. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that viral hepatitis coinfections are independent risk factors for hepatotoxicity. After 6 months of treatment, ritonavir was associated with higher rates of severe hepatotoxicity in the coinfected group; in fact, ritonavir seems to be the most strongly hepatotoxic agent among coinfected patients. After 12 months of therapy, hepatotoxicity occurred more frequently in patients with hepatitis C virus who did not respond to antiretroviral therapy (ART), whereas patients who did respond to ART showed decreased ALT levels. Hepatotoxicity is not exclusively an effect of drug toxicity, and the presence of hepatitis coinfection is an independent risk factor. Moreover, chronic hepatotoxicity mainly occurs in patients who did not respond to therapy. Conversely, patients who did respond to ART seemed to show improvement of chronic liver infection."

Human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are known to affect health outcomes of HIV-infected adults even in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the current study aimed to characterize the prevalence and clinical correlates of HAND in youth living with HIV. Here, we report baseline neurocognitive data for behaviorally HIV-infected youth enrolled in a prospective study evaluating strategies of antiretroviral treatment initiation and use."
4930,0.001,1.0000,"To evaluate the safety and antiviral action of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in HIV-1 infection, we undertook a proof of concept study in 27 treatment-naive patients. Eligible patients comprised two groups: the IFN-alphaT group (n = 17), which received 5 MIU IFN-alpha s.c. daily for 32 consecutive days, and the IFN-alphaNT group (n = 10), which did not receive IFN-alpha prior to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which was commenced on day 28 in both groups. IFN-alphaTreatment was well tolerated in 14 of the 17 patients of the IFN-alphaT group who completed the study. The mean HIV RNA reduction in the IFN-alphaT group on day 14 was 1.1 log(10). Viral load suppression was inversely associated with baseline viral load (p = 0.031). Four weeks after initiation of HAART, IFN-alphaT and IFN-alphaNT group patients had 2.40 and 1.82 log(10) HIV RNA reduction from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). There was no evidence of cross-resistance with existing antiretrovirals in patients with HIV-RNA rebound after initial plasma viral load decline > or = 1 log(10) during IFN-alpha monotherapy. Thus, low daily IFN-alpha exhibits potent anti-HIV-1 activity in vivo without serious adverse effects. These properties render IFN-alpha an attractive candidate for further assessment as a constituent of HAART."
303,0.001,1.0000,"Subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk for atherosclerosis. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) assessed using ultrasound and coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected using computed tomography predict cardiovascular risk in the general population; however, their usefulness and comparability in patients with HIV are less well defined. The purpose of this study was to compare IMT and CAC in the detection of atherosclerosis in subjects with HIV. CAC and IMT were measured in 253 HIV-infected and 58 uninfected adults. Associations among HIV-related factors, traditional risk factors, and CAC and IMT were evaluated. The distribution of IMT among subjects with and without CAC was compared. Among the patients with HIV, 37% had detectable CAC compared to 28% of controls (p = 0.19); 16% of the patients with HIV had CAC >100 compared to 5% of controls (p = 0.03). With either detectable or undetectable CAC, HIV-infected subjects had higher IMT compared to controls (1.02 ± 0.34 vs 0.78 ± 0.12 mm, p <0.0001), even after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Among those with undetectable CAC, 34% of patients with HIV had markedly increased IMT (≥1 mm) compared to no controls (p <0.0001). HIV-related factors were associated with IMT but not with CAC. In conclusion, patients with HIV and controls had similar rates of detectable CAC, while absolute CAC scores were modestly higher in the HIV group. Conversely, carotid IMT detected advanced subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with HIV even in the absence of CAC. Thus, with HIV, IMT is associated with disease-related factors and may be a more sensitive indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis than CAC."
8602,0.001,1.0000,"Although scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) since 2005 has contributed to declines of about 30% in the global annual number of human immunodeficiency (HIV)-related deaths and declines in global HIV incidence, estimated annual HIV-related deaths among adolescents have increased by about 50% and estimated adolescent HIV incidence has been relatively stable. In 2012, an estimated 2,500 (40%) of all 6,300 daily new HIV infections occurred among persons aged 15-24 years. Difficulty enrolling adolescents and young adults in ART and high rates of loss to follow-up (LTFU) after ART initiation might be contributing to mortality and HIV incidence in this age group, but data are limited. To evaluate age-related ART retention challenges, data from retrospective cohort studies conducted in seven African countries among 16,421 patients, aged ≥15 years at enrollment, who initiated ART during 2004-2012 were analyzed. ART enrollment and outcome data were compared among three groups defined by age at enrollment: adolescents and young adults (aged 15-24 years), middle-aged adults (aged 25-49 years), and older adults (aged ≥50 years). Enrollees aged 15-24 years were predominantly female (81%-92%), commonly pregnant (3%-32% of females), unmarried (54%-73%), and, in four countries with employment data, unemployed (53%-86%). In comparison, older adults were more likely to be male (p<0.001), employed (p<0.001), and married, (p<0.05 in five countries). Compared with older adults, adolescents and young adults had higher LTFU rates in all seven countries, reaching statistical significance in three countries in crude and multivariable analyses. Evidence-based interventions to reduce LTFU for adolescent and young adult ART enrollees could help reduce mortality and HIV incidence in this age group. "
345,0.001,1.0000,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is generally high in most resource-limited settings. However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
710,0.001,1.0000,"Advanced HIV disease, defined as a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/μl or the presence of an AIDS-defining illness, remains common among HIV-infected individuals who first present for medical care. In developed countries, nearly 30% of new HIV diagnoses occurred at advanced stages of the disease, and it is important because advanced HIV disease has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including lower rates of virological response, higher morbidity, and higher mortality. However, there are scarce data regarding which is the best antiretroviral regimen in these patients. Nowadays, integrase inhibitor-based regimens are widely recommended as the best initial therapy for treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients by all international guidelines. However, these guidelines hardly mention the recommended regimens in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Otherwise, recent data indicating a higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated to the use of integrase inhibitors have raised concerns on the use of these drugs in patients with advanced HIV disease. The aim of this article is to review the available evidence from randomized clinical trials for the best treatment in patients with advanced HIV disease."

This study evaluated the effect of NTZ on interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in vitro and in vivo among HIV/HCV genotype-1 (GT-1) treatment-naive patients. The ability of NTZ to enhance host response to interferon (IFN) signaling using the HCV cell culture system was initially evaluated. Second, ISG expression in 53 patients with treatment outcomes [21 SVR and 32 nonresponders (NR)] in the ACTG A5269 trial, a phase-II study (4-week lead in of NTZ 500 mg daily followed by 48 weeks of NTZ, PegIFN, and weight-based RBV), was assessed. The relative expression of 48 ISGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured at baseline, week 4, and week 8 of treatment in a blinded manner. In vitro NTZ produced a direct and additive antiviral effect with IFN-alfa, with pretreatment of NTZ resulting in maximal HCV suppression. NTZ augmented IFN-mediated ISG induction in PBMCs from relapsers and SVRs (p < 0.05), but not NR. In ACTG A5269, baseline expression of most ISGs was similar between NR and SVR. NTZ minimally induced 17 genes in NR and 13 genes in SVR after 4 weeks of therapy. However, after initiation of PegIFN and RBV, ISG induction was predominantly observed in the SVR group and not NR group. NTZ treatment facilitates IFN-induced suppression of HCV replication. Inability to achieve SVR with IFN-based therapy in this clinical trial is associated with diminished ISG response to therapy that is refractory to NTZ."
2364,0.001,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to investigate possible resistance mutations which arose in the polymerase gene of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a patient with severe recurrent HBV infection following liver transplantation. The patient's management included antiviral chemotherapy for almost 4 years comprising ganciclovir, foscarnet and famciclovir. In the last 2.5 years of famciclovir treatment, an increase in serum HBV DNA levels and a reduced sensitivity of the virion-associated DNA polymerase to penciclovir triphosphate were observed."
178,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype G (HBV/G) was detected in sera from four individuals by polymerase chain reaction with hemi-nested primers deduced from an insertion of 36 nt in the core gene that is specific for this genotype. Despite two stop codons in the precore region characteristic of HBV/G, all patients were positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum. When 10 HBV clones were propagated from one patient, and sequenced within precore region and a section of the core gene, 6 clones were HBV/G while 2 were genotype A (HBV/A); a recombination between HBV/G and HBV/A occurred in the remaining 2 clones. Mixed infection of HBV/G and HBV/A, as well as the recombination, was demonstrated in the sequence of preS1 and preS2 regions also. Coinfection with HBV/G and HBV/A was demonstrated in the other three patients, and their recombination in two patients. Ten HBV clones were propagated from one patient at two time points separated by 1 year. Clones of HBV/A, HBV/G and their recombination were found in 9 : 1 : 0 when the patient was positive for HBeAg, while the proportion shifted to 0 : 8 : 2 after the patient seroconverted to anti-HBe. In conclusion, HBV/G is frequently found as a coinfection with HBV/A. This coinfection would explain the presence of HBeAg in individuals infected with HBV/G. Along with seroconversion to anti-HBe, HBV/G would be selected accompanied by the recombination with HBV/A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these findings."
2719,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is known to show significant genetic diversity. There are eight HBV genotypes (A-H) characterized by distinct geographical distribution. Mutations in the HBV genome, in particular precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations, may be important factors in the pathogenesis of disease. In this study genetic heterogeneity and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates from 32 naïve patients with acute HBV infection was investigated. Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had self-limiting illness. Only four isolates from patients with severe HBV infection harbored the G1896A stop codon mutation. One isolate (Irish-13), collected from a patient with acute asymptomatic infection, had a G1896A mutation and a 243 bp deletion of the polymerase gene. A triple mutation, T1753C/A1762T/G1764A was identified in only one isolate (Irish-3) associated with severe infection. The latter also had a mutation, A2339G, in the core gene, not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by genotype D. Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 isolates, including Gly145Ala, associated with vaccine immune escape, Asp144Glu, Ser143Leu and Phe134Leu, each associated with failure to detect HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis was determined using amplicons of the S gene (678 bp) and distal-X/PC region (672 bp). Genotype A was the most common (75%), followed by genotype D (15.6%), and equal proportions of C, E, F, and H. A novel recombinant of genotypes D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West Africa. Genetic heterogeneity of HBV isolates of HBV isolates from patients with acute infection needs further study of its significance."
1734,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the population of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals from Slovenia and Croatia was determined. One hundred and sixty-six out of a total of 188 Slovenian HIV-1-infected individuals and 120 subjects who were randomly chosen out of a total 342 Croatian HIV-1 antibodies-positive individuals were tested for HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibodies was carried out by a third generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and the positive samples were additionally tested by a third generation immuno-blot assay. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA was determined in all serum samples by a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four (14.5%) out of 166 Slovenian and 18 (15.0%) out of 120 Croatian HIV-1-infected individuals were HCV antibodies-positive. Nineteen out of 24 (79.2%) Slovenian and 13 out of 18 (72.2%) Croatian anti-HCV positive individuals were also viremic. HCV RNA was not detected in any of 244 HCV antibodies-negative/HIV-1-infected individual from both countries. A significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between blood (77.8% in Slovenia and 66.7% in Croatia) and sexual exposure risk groups (1.6% in Slovenia and 6.6% in Croatia) was found in both countries. In a study carried out on the highest proportion of entire population of HIV-1-infected individuals from a certain country or geographic region, Slovenia and Croatia were identified as countries with the second and third lowest prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-1/HIV-2 infected individuals worldwide."
4566,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of transfusion-induced chronic liver disease in hemophiliacs, with 70% to 90% being anti-HCV positive. Seroreversion or loss of antibody response to HCV has been observed in a small proportion of human immunodeficiency virus-positive [HIV(+)] anti-HCV(+) hemophilic men. Despite the seroreversion to an anti-HCV-negative state, such patients continue to show serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations and biopsy evidence of cirrhosis and/or chronic active hepatitis. To determine the cause for the loss of anti-HCV antibody, we compared first- and second-generation anti-HCV enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA 1.0 and 2.0), second-generation recombinant immunoblot (RIBA 2.0), and HCV-RNA amplification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 19 ""seroreverters"" before and after seroreversion. There was no difference between 19 seroreverters and 59 persistently anti-HCV-positive hemophiliacs in mean ALT (1.1 +/- 0.1 XUL v 2.0 +/- 0.2 XUL; chi 2 = 1.80, P > .05), in mean CD4 (188 +/- 36/microL v 232 +/- 28/microL; t = 0.965, P > .05), or in the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (13 of 19 [68.4%] v 30 of 59 [50.9%]; chi 2 = .987, P > .05, respectively). Before seroreversion, all 19 seroreverters (100%) were positive for EIA 1.0 and 2.0 and PCR, and all but 2 of 19 (89.5%) were RIBA 2.0 positive, whereas, after seroreversion, none were positive for EIA 1.0, 15 of 19 (78.9%) were positive for EIA 2.0, 8 of 18 (44.4%) were positive for RIBA 2.0, and 18 of 19 (94.7%) were positive for PCR. There was a lower CD4 lymphocyte number after seroreversion in those who were RIBA 2.0 negative as compared with those who were RIBA 2.0 positive (32 +/- 10/microL v 171 +/- 52/microL; t = 2.638, P > .05). These results indicate that HIV(+) anti-HCV(+) hemophilic men who undergo ""HCV seroreversion"" are truly infectious and anti-HCV positive by second-generation tests. Anti-HCV detection in immunosuppressed hosts is significantly improved by second-generation EIA and RIBA assays."
2253,0.001,1.0000,"In a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination in inhibiting HBV replication of chronic hepatitis B. Fourteen consecutive chronic HBs antigen carriers received standard vaccination with three injections of the GenHevac B vaccine, one month apart. All the patients had active HBV replication with chronic hepatitis but not cirrhosis. They were compared to a historical group of 34 patients who fulfilled the same inclusion criteria. Over the 6-month follow-up period after the first injection, serum HBV DNA became undetectable in 3 patients (21.4%). Four additional patients (28.6%) showed a significant decrease in HBV replication. In 4 cases, the disappearance of or decrease in HBV DNA was preceded by an increase in transaminase activities, which was also observed in one patient who did not modify his viral replication. Vaccination was otherwise uneventful. By contrast, during a mean follow-up of 40 months, only 3 (9%) of the 34 unvaccinated patients who served as controls lost serum HBV DNA, giving a 6-month HBV DNA disappearance rate of 1%. In sum, vaccination appeared able to reduce or stop HBV replication in half of the chronic HBsAg carriers with chronic hepatitis. This additional therapeutic tool may enhance the rate of response to interferon-alpha therapy, which is dependent on the level of HBV replication. Thus, immunotherapy should be considered of potential importance for the treatment of HBV infection."
4784,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of antibodies to HCV varies among Brazilian regions at rates of 8-16%. Since this virus is transmitted by the parenteral route through blood and blood products, patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis therapy are at an increased risk of infection. The study was conducted in seven dialysis centers in Belém, Pará, northern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 798 patients with chronic renal disease treated by hemodialysis. The samples were tested for antibodies against HCV and the viral genotype was identified. Sixty-seven (8.4%) of the 798 patients studied were anti-HCV positive by ELISA, ranging from 4% to 14% in different centers. Viral RNA was detected in 5.3% (43/798) of the patients; of these, 42 also had anti-HCV antibodies. HCV genotyping revealed genotype 1 as the most common, detected in 86.1% (37/43) of the patients, followed by genotype 2 in 11.6% (5/43) and genotype 3 in one patient (2.3%). The findings of this study highlight the importance of control strategies for hepatitis C in hemodialysis patients. Molecular biology methods need to be available in these centers to screen for HCV on admission in order to establish effective infection control measures."
8896,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate if early syphilis infection affects markers of HIV infection; CD4 T cells and viral load (VL). A retrospective study was performed on 160 HIV-positive patients (111 receiving antiretroviral therapy [ART] and 49 without ART). Early syphilis diagnosis was made in HIV patients during their follow-up at the HIV/AIDS Unit at a Greek Dermatology and Venereology Unit. The patients' blood tests were available at the time of diagnosis, as well as before and 12 weeks after early syphilis diagnosis. CD4 T cell counts and VL levels were measured. It was found that syphilis infection had a negative impact on the CD4 T cell counts in both groups, with reduced CD4 T cell counts observed in 84.6% (99/111) and 79.5% (39/49) of patients receiving and not receiving ART, respectively. After treatment for syphilis, CD4 T cell counts returned to pre-treatment levels in most patients, especially those receiving ART. There was a slight and transient VL increase. Patients receiving ART had a 27% increase in VL, compared to 71.4% among patients not receiving ART. Although the VL increase was slight (41-14,000 copies/ml) in the group under treatment, 4-5% (5/111) patients did not return to pre-treatment levels. Moreover, viral mutations associated with treatment resistance were identified in these patients. Early syphilis accelerates and complicates the progression of HIV infection. Early diagnosis and treatment of syphilis may prevent infection-associated complications in most instances. Consequently, prevention of syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections is of great importance for patients infected with HIV."
7383,0.001,1.0000,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which can be a complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure and peripheral vascular resistance, subsequently leading to right heart failure. In HIV-infected patients, the management of PAH is challenging given the potential drug interactions between PAH-specific vasodilators and antiretroviral drugs. We describe a 51-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated PAH. She was treated with the oral endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan while taking a nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)-based antiretroviral regimen. Due to concerns about potential drug interactions with the antiretroviral therapy, her nevirapine plasma concentration, as well as CD4(+) cell count and viral load, were continuously monitored. We observed no interaction between bosentan and nevirapine during a 4-year period. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate successful, long-term coadministration of bosentan and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor."
12,0.001,1.0000,"A proportion of the plasma for the triply inactivated, plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine produced in the United States is obtained from homosexual men. Because homosexual men are a high-risk group for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), concern has emerged that the vaccine could harbor the AIDS agent. To evaluate this risk, we tested 15-month postvaccination serum samples for antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III in 100 health care workers who had received inactivated hepatitis B vaccine lots made from plasma collected between 1977 and 1979 and 100 who had received placebo injections. None of the 200 health workers had serological evidence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III infection. These serological findings lend additional support to earlier epidemiologic and immunologic observations suggesting that hepatitis B vaccine does not transmit infection with an AIDS virus."
4911,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to be a major global public health issue and omnipresent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increase the risk of HIV acquisition. Moreover, STIs and HIV in pregnant women can harm the unborn child. In this study, we systematically investigated the prevalence of HIV, relevant STIs and vaginal group B streptococcus colonization among pregnant women presenting at Asella Teaching Hospital in central Ethiopia and their effect on perinatal mortality. A follow-up was performed six weeks after delivery. A total of 580 women were included, of which 26.6% tested positive for at least one pathogen ( Chlamydia trachomatis 9.8%, trichomoniasis 5.3%, hepatitis B 5.3%, gonorrhoea 4.3%, group B streptococcus 2.4%, syphilis 2.2%, HIV 2.1%). None of the HIV infections were previously undiagnosed, indicating effective HIV screening activities in the region. Follow-up data were available for 473 (81.6%) children, of which 37 (7.8%) were stillborn or died within the first six weeks of life. Infection with Trichomonas vaginalis and recruitment at obstetric ward (versus antenatal care) were associated with mortality. High prevalence of STIs in pregnant women and their impact on the unborn child demonstrate the need for screening and treatment programmes in order to prevent perinatal mortality."
8959,0.001,1.0000,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
2989,0.001,1.0000,"To improve the utility of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vectors for gene therapy, the viral envelope needs to be manipulated to achieve cell-specific gene delivery. In this report, we have engineered an HSV-1 mutant virus, KgBpK(-) gC(-), deleted for the glycoprotein C (gC) and the heparan sulfate-binding domain (pK) of gB, in order to express gC:preS1 and gC:preS1 active peptide (preS1ap) fusion molecules. PreS1, and a 27 amino acid active peptide inside preS1 (preS1ap), are supposed to be the molecules that the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) needs to bind specifically to hepatocytes. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the gC:preS1ap fusion molecule was expressed and incorporated into the envelope of the recombinant HSV-1 virus KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap. Moreover, KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap recombinant virus gained a specific binding activity to an hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) with a consequent productive infection. In addition, anti-preS1-specific antibodies were shown to neutralize recombinant virus infectivity, and a synthetic preS1ap peptide was able to elute KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap virus bound on HpeG2 cells. These data provide further evidence that HSV-1 can productively infect cells through a specific binding to a non-HSV-1 receptor. Furthermore, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the HBV preS1ap molecule is an HBV ligand to hepatocytes."
9839,0.001,1.0000,"The effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the plasma levels of hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA) has varied in published reports. We measured the impact of IL-2 on plasma HCV RNA levels in 54 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfected patients enrolled in a randomized trial of 512 participants designed to compare the virologic and immunologic effects of cycled IL-2 plus antiretroviral therapy (ART) vs ART alone in the treatment of HIV in patients with CD4 cell counts > or =300 cells/mm(3). The mean decreases in average HCV RNA levels (copies/mL, log (10)) were 0.28 log in the IL-2 group (n = 26) and 0.04 log in the ART alone group (n = 28) at 12 months (P = 0.18). The changes in HCV RNA level were not associated with baseline or nadir CD4 cell counts, baseline aspartate aminotransferanse, CD4 cell response to IL-2, or changes in plasma HIV RNA values. Compared with those participants who only had HIV, the HIV/HCV co-infected patients did not have a significantly different CD4 cell response to IL-2 therapy. Intermittent IL-2 therapy does not produce a significant sustained decrease in plasma HCV RNA levels among patients co-infected with HIV/HCV who are on highly active ART."
8178,0.001,1.0000,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as an important cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."
1540,0.001,1.0000,"Efficient assembly of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was achieved by cotransfection of Huh7 cells with two plasmids: one to provide expression of the large, middle, and small envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV), the natural helper of HDV, and another to initiate replication of the HDV RNA genome. HDV released into the media was assayed for HDV RNA and HBV envelope proteins and characterized by rate-zonal sedimentation, immunoaffinity purification, electron microscopy, and the ability to infect primary human hepatocytes. Among the novel findings were that (i) immunostaining for delta antigen 6 days after infection with 300 genome equivalents (GE) per cell showed only 1% of cells as infected, but this was increased to 16% when 5% polyethylene glycol was present during infection; (ii) uninfected cells did not differ from infected cells in terms of albumin accumulation or the presence of E-cadherin at cell junctions; and (iii) sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assays detected HDV replication even when the multiplicity of infection was 0.2 GE/cell. In the future, this HDV assembly and infection system can be further developed to better understand the mechanisms shared by HBV and HDV for attachment and entry into host cells."

During 3.5 years of observation, cases of hepatitis B and C infection among patients and medical staff were rare. The production of alpha- and gamma-IFN in 23 patients with HBV and/or HCV markers on hemodialysis and in 38 patients without markers was similarly decreased in comparison with the controls and the titers of serum IFN were similarly increased. Lack of reliable difference between IFN status of two groups of patients may be explained by the absence of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, confirmed by laboratory findings."

This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."

Clearance rates of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in peripheral blood as well as the preexistence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV were determined over 52 weeks of treatment. The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia."
4370,0.001,1.0000,"The infection routes of HIV-1 can affect several viral properties, including dissemination, pathogenesis, and immune evasion. In this study, we evaluated the inhibitory activity of a wide variety of anti-HIV drugs, focusing on the impact that different infection pathways have on their efficacy. Compared to cell-free infection, inhibitory activities were reduced in cell-to-cell productive transmission for all drugs tested. We detected weak reporter-expressing target cells after cell-to-cell transmission in the presence of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Further analysis revealed that this expression was mainly due to unintegrated circular HIV (cHIV) DNAs, consisting of 1-LTR and 2-LTR circles. When in vitro-constructed cHIV DNAs were introduced into cells, the production of infectious and intercellular transmittable virions was observed, suggesting that cHIV DNA could be a source of infectious virus. These results highlight some advantages of the cell-to-cell infection mode for viral expansion, particularly in the presence of anti-retroviral drugs."
5258,0.001,1.0000,"Recent studies suggest that human endogenous retrovirus group K (HERV-K) provirus expression plays a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In particular, RNA from the HML-2 subgroup of HERV-K proviruses has been reported to be highly expressed at the cellular level and detectable in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, suggestive of virion production and, perhaps, replication. In this study, we developed an HML-2-specific quantitative-PCR assay that detects 51 of the 89 known HML-2 proviruses in the human genome. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-negative controls and HIV-1-infected patients were collected for analysis of HML-2 RNA expression. Contrary to previous reports, we did not detect high levels of HML-2 RNA in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients, but we did observe a significant increase of HML-2 RNA in total PBMCs compared to HIV-negative controls. The level of HML-2 expression in PBMCs does not appear to be related to patient use of antiretrovirals or to HIV-1 plasma RNA, cellular RNA, or cellular DNA levels. To investigate the source of HML-2 RNA expression, patient PBMCs were sorted into CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD8+, CD3- CD14+, and CD3- CD20+ cell subsets and then analyzed for HML-2 RNA levels. No single cell subset was enriched for HML-2 RNA expression in HIV-1-infected patients, but there appears to be substantial variability in the level of HML-2 expression depending on the cell type."

Three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols were used to detect TTV DNA in sera of persons infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in blood donors. Sera from 11.5% of HCV-infected patients and 7.7% of blood donors were positive by protocols 1 or 2. In contrast, 48.7% and 57.7% of sera, respectively, were positive when tested by protocol 3. There was no difference in the severity of hepatitis in persons coinfected with TTV and HCV when compared with those infected with HCV alone, regardless of which TTV PCR protocol was used. TTV DNA persisted in serum samples taken up to 6 years apart in individual patients. Sequence analysis indicated that most viral sequences were distinct between patients, and there was evidence of genetic heterogeneity and viral evolution within individuals."

We examined steatosis in an unselected cohort of coinfected patients and compared its prevalence and predictors with findings in monoinfected patients, where these relationships have been established. We studied 92 coinfected and 372 monoinfected patients undergoing staging liver biopsy. Baseline characteristics of the two groups differed significantly, pointing at different contributors to steatosis in each. Histological inflammation and fibrosis were very similar in the two groups, but steatosis was less in coinfected patients. Steatosis had a univariate association with fibrosis in both groups, but retained a multivariate association only in monoinfected patients. Other multivariate predictors of steatosis in monoinfected patients were the accepted variables of elevated body mass index, male sex, and genotype 3a infection, as well as age. In coinfected patients, however, age was the only multivariate predictor. Undetectable HIV viral load was associated with steatosis in coinfected patients in univariate analysis, but highly active antiretroviral therapy or its individual components could not be initially linked to steatosis. In conclusion, steatosis is less common in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than similar HCV monoinfected patients, and predictors of steatosis differ between the two groups."
8119,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 transmitted drug resistance in the drug-naïve population is of growing relevance in Estonia, where the number of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced subjects has been exponentially increasing during the last 10 y. The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed subjects in Estonia in 2008. Genotypic resistance testing for viral genomic RNA was conducted for 201 subjects tested HIV-positive between 1 April and 30 November 2008. Of 145 genotyped viral strains in newly diagnosed patients, 123 were CRF06_cpx, 2 were subtype A1 and 3 were subtype B; in 17 cases viral sequences revealed recombinant structures similar to CRF06_cpx, subtype A1 and CRF02_AG. Resistance mutations were found in 8 (5.5%) virus strains, and 3 strains were resistant to at least 2 ARV classes. A total of 2.8% of sequences harboured mutations indicating nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (M41L, M184V, M184I, T215C and T215D), 2.1% non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (K103N, P225H) and 2.8% protease inhibitor resistance (M46I, L90M). These data suggest the need to extend genotypic HIV-1 drug resistance testing to newly diagnosed HIV-positive subjects to prevent potential ARV treatment failure."
6675,0.001,1.0000,"During investigations of the evolution of experimental laboratory infections of woodchucks (Marmota monax) with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), eight hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were observed, six in newborns and two in young adult animals, all within 17-36 months after infection. The absence of an external cocarcinogenic effect in the well-monitored woodchucks indicates the carcinogenicity of WHV and suggests the same for the genetically and biologically similar human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Laboratory infections of woodchucks with two strains of WHV, not reported here in detail, resembled human and chimpanzee HBV infections histologically and serologically. In these studies, eight woodchucks became carriers of surface antigen of WHV for greater than 1 year. All eight woodchucks developed HCC, indicating a 100% risk of HCC in experimentally infected chronic WHV antigen carriers, which is analogous to the high risk of HCC in human hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. Histologically, the absence of cirrhosis in the examined pericarcinomatous tissue permits recognition of gradual transition from normal parenchyma to neoplastic nodules to HCC of rising anaplasia, indicating a continuum of increasingly more malignant neoplastic stages, as known for chemical carcinogenesis. The HCC developed in carrier woodchucks infected as newborns with only minor, if any, hepatitic changes but is associated with antigen-carrying hepatocytes and sometimes with hyperplastic nodules. This stage was preceded in infected adults by an early, acute, weeks-long hepatitis coinciding with the appearance of surface antigen. These findings are also analogous to typical HBV infection in human newborns and young adults, respectively. At the time of HCC development in all animals with adequate histologic material, an acute recent necroinflammation appeared around the tumor, associated with abnormal hematopoietic cells around and within the tumor. A promoting role in carcinogenesis of this necroinflammation of yet unestablished pathogenesis is being postulated, to be confirmed by determination of the status of the WHV DNA in the HCC and by prospective histologic study of the inflammatory reaction."
3540,0.001,1.0000,"The betulinic acid derivative IC9564 is a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) compound that can inhibit both HIV primary isolates and laboratory-adapted strains. However, this compound did not affect the replication of simian immunodeficiency virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Results from a syncytium formation assay indicated that IC9564 blocked HIV type 1 (HIV-1) envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Analysis of a chimeric virus derived from exchanging envelope regions between IC9564-sensitive and IC9564-resistant viruses indicated that regions within gp120 and the N-terminal 25 amino acids (fusion domain) of gp41 are key determinants for the drug sensitivity. By developing a drug-resistant mutant from the NL4-3 virus, two mutations were found within the gp120 region and one was found within the gp41 region. The mutations are G237R and R252K in gp120 and R533A in the fusion domain of gp41. The mutations were reintroduced into the NL4-3 envelope and analyzed for their role in IC9564 resistance. Both of the gp120 mutations contributed to the drug sensitivity. On the contrary, the gp41 mutation (R533A) did not appear to affect the IC9564 sensitivity. These results suggest that HIV-1 gp120 plays a key role in the anti-HIV-1 activity of IC9564."
2672,0.001,1.0000,"Adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) is an oral prodrug of the nucleotide analogue adefovir. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults. Adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day significantly improved histological, biochemical and virological outcomes in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative patients, and serological outcomes in HBeAg-positive patients. In two trials, the proportion of adefovir dipivoxil recipients showing histological improvement in the liver was approximately twice that for placebo recipients. In two trials in patients chronically infected with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV), switching to or adding adefovir dipivoxil was significantly more effective at reducing serum HBV DNA levels than continuing lamivudine monotherapy. In treatment-naive patients, 1 year's treatment with adefovir dipivoxil plus lamivudine had similar efficacy to lamivudine plus placebo; however, lamivudine-resistant HBV emerged in significantly more patients receiving lamivudine plus placebo. Adefovir dipivoxil has also shown efficacy in noncomparative trials in patients with decompensated liver disease, patients co-infected with HIV and patients pre- or post-liver transplantation. Within 96 weeks of treatment with adefovir dipivoxil, a resistance-conferring mutation emerged in viral isolates from 1.6% of patients. In vitro, these isolates remained sensitive to lamivudine, while lamivudine-resistant HBV isolates remained sensitive to adefovir dipivoxil. Adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day is generally well tolerated. In a pooled analysis of 48-week data from two trials, there was no marked difference in adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between adefovir dipivoxil and placebo recipients. Within 96 weeks of treatment with adefovir dipivoxil, >1% of patients with adequate renal function developed an increase in serum creatinine levels of >/=0.5 mg/dL above baseline. Within 48 weeks of treatment, increases in serum creatinine levels of >/=0.5 mg/dL above baseline were observed in 13% of pre- and post-liver transplantation patients who generally had renal insufficiency or risk factors for renal dysfunction at baseline. Most patients continued treatment with dosage adjustments."
6591,0.001,1.0000,"We report a case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that showed subacute progressive cerebellar ataxia without HIV encephalopathy or other encephalopathies, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or encephalitis of other human herpes virus (HHV) infections. A 43-year-old man exhibited unsteady gait. Neurological examination disclosed ataxia of the trunk and lower extremities. Personality change and dementia were absent. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any abnormal finding, including of the cerebellum. The serum HIV-1-RNA was 1.2 × 10(5) copies/ml, and the absolute CD4 lymphocyte count was 141 cells/ml. Remarkably, the serum anti-Yo antibody, as an anti-cerebellar antibody of paraneoplastic syndrome, and anti-gliadin antibody, associated with celiac disease or gluten ataxia, were positive. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunoglobulin G index was 1.2 (< 0.8), and oligoclonal bands were present. PCR of the CSF was negative for HIV, JC virus, other HHVs, and mycosis. Previous reports presented HIV-infected patients with concurrent autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-phospholipid syndrome, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, Graves' disease, and hepatic diseases. These might have been present in patients with a CD4 T lymphocyte count of more than 200 cells/ml. On the other hand, paraneoplastic syndrome, gluten ataxia, cerebellar ataxia associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, and Hashimoto's encephalopathy might manifest as autoimmune cerebellar ataxia. As regards the association of HIV infection and autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, a previous report suggested that anti-gliadin antibody was detected in about 30% of HIV-infected children, though there is no reference to an association with cerebellar ataxia. Moreover, to our knowledge, detection of anti-Yo antibody in an HIV-infected patient with cerebellar ataxia has not been reported. These findings suggest that, although it is extremely rare, clinicians need to consider HIV infection in a patient exhibiting autoimmune cerebellar ataxia."
6790,0.001,1.0000,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
3292,0.001,1.0000,"The incidence of arterial and venous thrombosis in HIV-infected patients is increased compared to healthy controls. In this cross-sectional analysis we measured markers of endothelial cell activation, thrombin generation, fibrinolysis and anticoagulation combined with endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and activated protein C sensitivity ratio (APCsr) as more global markers. We included 160 consecutive HIV-infected patients with a median age of 46 years (range, 27-77), of whom 92% were male, 74% Caucasian, 11% African American, 9% Hispanic, and 6% Asian. Homosexual contact was the main transmission mode. Seventy percent of patients were using combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). In 83% of patients laboratory markers outside the normal range for a non-HIV-infected population were observed. Significant lower levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF; p = 0.03), factor VIII (p < 0.0001), D-dimer (p = 0.01), and ETP (p = 0.01) were observed in HIV-infected patients on cART compared to patients not on cART. Significant lower levels of protein C (p = 0.05) and free protein S (p < 0.0001), and increased APCsr (p < 0.0001) were found in the HIV-infected patients not on cART. A single association was observed between raised levels of fibrinogen and use of a protease inhibitor (p = 0.002). No significant difference was observed in the percentage of patients with laboratory markers outside the normal range between patients using cART-regimens containing abacavir, stavudine, or didanosine and those with other nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Although the prevalence of coagulation abnormalities was lower in HIV-infected patients using cART, a considerable proportion of HIV-infected patients on cART show endothelial cell activation and increased APCsr, suggestive of a persistent procoagulant state."
7214,0.001,1.0000,"Point mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) have been associated with reduced sensitivity of the virus to inhibition by the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (ZDV). During therapy we have previously observed the accumulation of these mutations, at codons 41, 67, 70, 215, and 219 of the RT gene, in proviral DNA sequences from infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in cell-free virus RNA. Using a quantitative point mutation assay (PMA) we have been able to quantify the proportions of mutant and wild-type sequences at these points in mixed populations of viral RNA and DNA derived from clinical samples. Thus we have confirmed that the mutations can be detected earlier in cell-free virus RNA than in PBMC proviral DNA and their accumulation in RNA precedes that in DNA. We have analyzed serial samples from 10 subjects undergoing zidovudine therapy and shown significantly higher levels of mutations in cell-free viral RNA than in PBMC proviral DNA at codons 41, 70, and 215 during the in vivo acquisition of the mutations. In the group of subjects studied the mean time delay between RNA and DNA reaching a given level of mutation was 25 days."
4875,0.001,1.0000,"The methionine-to-valine mutation in codon 184 (M184V) in reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) confers resistance to (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC; lamivudine) and increased sensitivity to 9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA; tenofovir). We have used the SIV model to evaluate the effect of the M184V mutation on the emergence of resistance to the combination of 3TC plus PMPA. A site-directed mutant of SIVmac239 containing M184V (SIVmac239-184V) was used to select for resistance to both 3TC and PMPA by serial passage in the presence of increasing concentrations of both drugs. Under these selection conditions, the M184V mutation reverted in the majority of the selections. Variants resistant to both drugs were found to have the lysine-to-arginine mutation at codon 65 (K65R), which has previously been associated with resistance to PMPA in both SIV and HIV. Similarly, in rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239-184V for 46 weeks and treated daily with (-)-2'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine [(-)-FTC], there was no reversion of M184V, but this mutation reverted to 184 M in all three animals within 24 weeks of treatment with (-)-FTC and PMPA. Although the addition of PMPA to the (-)-FTC therapy induced a decrease in virus loads in plasma, these loads eventually returned to pre-PMPA levels in each case. All animals receiving this combination developed the K65R mutation. These results demonstrate that the combination of PMPA with 3TC or (-)-FTC selects for the K65R mutation and against the M184V mutation in SIV RT."
728,0.001,1.0000,"Mathematical modeling of viral replication dynamics, based on sequential measurements of levels of virion-associated RNA in plasma during antiretroviral treatment, has led to fundamental new insights into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pathogenesis. We took advantage of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque model to perform detailed measurements and mathematical modeling during primary infection and during treatment of established infection with the antiretroviral drug (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA). The calculated clearance half-life for productively infected cells during resolution of the peak viremia of primary infection was on the order of 1 day, with slightly shorter clearance half-lives calculated during PMPA treatment. Viral reproduction rates upon discontinuation of PMPA treatment after 2 weeks were approximately twofold greater than those obtained just prior to initiation of treatment in the same animals, likely reflecting accumulation of susceptible target cells during treatment. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) for the spread of SIV infection in vivo, which represents the number of productively infected cells derived from each productively infected cell at the beginning of infection, was also estimated. This parameter quantifies the extent to which antiviral therapy or vaccination must limit the initial spread of virus to prevent establishment of chronic disseminated infection. The results thus provide an important guide for efforts to develop vaccines against SIV and, by extension, human immunodeficiency virus."
9600,0.001,1.0000,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which causes an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in macaques, is a lentivirus that is morphologically, antigenically, genetically, and biologically similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Because of these similarities, the SIV model represents a unique opportunity for in vitro and in vivo testing of antiretroviral agents. Since antiretroviral agents may exhibit different properties in different cells in vitro, more than one cell line may be necessary to evaluate the efficacy and modes of action of an antiretroviral agent. Initially we tested ten cell lines for their permissiveness to five SIV isolates. One B-cell line (AA-2) and one T-cell line (HuT 78) were selected to test antiretroviral agents since both were extremely permissive for SIVmac251, an isolate with a high rate of infectivity. Using this optimized in vitro testing protocol, we screened ten antiretroviral agents for their ability to inhibit SIV replication. Six of the compounds completely inhibited SIV viral antigen expression. Based on the selectivity index, 3'-azido-3'-dideoxythymidine, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxyuridine, and 3'-fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine appear to be the most efficacious antiretroviral agents against SIVmac251. Several different assays for determining viral antigen inhibition were conducted and the results of these assays were comparable. Our results demonstrate that the SIV in vitro model is a valuable screening tool for determining the efficacy and toxicity of new antiretroviral agents."

In a prospective open pilot study, 24 HIV-1-infected HAART-treated patients with undetectable plasma viral loads (pVLs) and CD4(+) T-cell counts above 350/mm(3) were immunized at weeks 0, 3, and 6 with a candidate vaccine consisting of six HIV lipopeptides. At week 24, patients with pVLs of <1.7 log(10) copies/ml were invited to stop taking HAART. Antiretroviral therapy was resumed if the pVL rose above 4.47 log(10) copies/ml and/or if the CD4(+) cell count fell below 250/mm(3). Immunological and virologic parameters were studied before and after HAART interruption. The median baseline and nadir CD4(+) cell counts were 482 (interquartile range [IQR], 195 to 826) and 313 (IQR, 1 to 481)/mm(3), respectively. New specific CD8(+) cell responses to HIV-1 epitopes were detected after immunization in 13 (57%) of 23 assessable patients. Twenty-one patients were evaluated 96 weeks after HAART interruption. The median time to pVL rebound was 4 weeks (IQR, 2 to 6), and the median peak pVL was 4.26 (IQR, 3 to 5) log(10) copies/ml. Thirteen of these 21 patients resumed HAART a median of 60 weeks after immunization (IQR, 9.2 to 68.4 weeks), when the median pVL was 4.8 (IQR, 2.9 to 5.7) log(10) copies/ml and the median CD4(+) cell count was 551 (IQR, 156 to 778)/mm(3). Eight patients were still off therapy at 96 weeks, with a median pVL of 4 (IQR, 1.7 to 4.6) log(10) copies/ml and a median CD4(+) cell count of 412 (IQR, 299 to 832)/mm(3). No clinical disease progression had occurred. Despite the lack of a control arm, these findings warrant a randomized study of therapeutic vaccination with HIV lipopeptides followed by long-term HAART interruption in AIDS-free chronically infected patients."
557,0.001,1.0000,"The gp41 subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein plays an important role in HIV-1 entry and severs as an attractive target for development of HIV-1 entry inhibitors, a new class of anti-HIV drugs. Triggered by gp120 binding to CD4 and a coreceptor, gp41 undergoes a conformation shift from a native prefusogenic state to a fusogenic state, in which the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) associate to form a six-helix bundle, representing the fusion-active gp41 core. Any compound that disrupts the gp41 six-helix bundle formation may inhibit the gp41-mediated membrane fusion, thereby blocking HIV-1 entry into target cells. Peptides derived from the gp41 NHR and CHR regions, designated N- and C-peptides, can interact with the counterpart regions in gp41 and interfere with the six-helix bundle formation between the viral NHR and CHR region, thus inhibiting fusion of the virus with the target cell. One of the C-peptides, T-20 (brand name: Fuzeon), was recently approved by the US FDA as the first HIV entry inhibitor which can be used for treatment of AIDS patients who fail to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs, e.g., the reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. The limitations of T-20 include lack of oral availability and high cost of production. Thus it is essential to develop small molecule HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting gp41. This review summarizes the newly developed techniques for high throughput screening (HTS) and characterization of the HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting gp41. The theories behind these techniques are also discussed. It is expected that the ""drug-like"" compounds with potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activity will be identified in the near future and used as leads for development of the low molecular weight HIV-1 entry inhibitors for the chemotherapy of HIV-1 infection and AIDS."
5716,0.001,1.0000,"It is generally agreed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is reduced by hepatitis delta virus infection (HDV) and augmented by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the precise nature of the interactions between HBV, HDV and HIV is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on HBV and HDV replication, and on histological scores during delta virus superinfection in HDV-positive, chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We studied 38 men and six women, 15 of whom were HIV-positive and all of whom had at least one marker of HDV infection. Serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA, HDV RNA, anti-delta antigen antibodies (anti-HD) IgM, anti-HD IgG and hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) were tested for in the serum and liver, respectively; anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies were detected using a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Histological specimens were scored blindly according to Knodell's classification for periportal and intralobular necrosis, portal inflammation and fibrosis. HBV DNA was detected more frequently in the HIV-positive patients than in those who were HIV-negative (25 vs 0%; P = 0.01), while markers of HDV replication (serum anti-HD IgM, serum HDV RNA and liver HDAg) were as frequent in the HIV-positive patients (69%, 40% and 50%, respectively) as in those who were HIV-negative (75%, 52% and 30%, respectively; P > 0.05). By contrast, 31% of the HIV-positive patients were serum HDAg-positive compared to only 6% of the HIV-negative patients (P = 0.001). HDV antigenaemia and anti-HD antibodies usually fluctuated in the HIV-positive patients during follow-up. The mean Knodell score was similar in the HIV-positive (11.5 +/- 3.2) and HIV-negative (10.7 +/- 2) subgroups, as was the mean semi-quantitative index of hepatic necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our results provide evidence that in HDV-positive patients: (1) HIV infection counters the inhibitory effect of HDV superinfection on HBV replication; (2) serum anti-HD IgM. HDV RNA and liver HDAg are not more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients, suggesting that HIV infection has no effect on HDV replication (although the significance of the increased frequency of HD antigenaemia remains unclear); (3) the histological severity of liver disease is not influenced by HIV status."
8958,0.001,1.0000,"We investigated the frequency of HBsAg clearance and the possible role of viral superinfection in a long-term follow-up of 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Our subjects were 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B and the follow-up was 12-216 months (mean 66.2 +/- 53.7 months). The investigative methods used were: immunoenzymatic assays for HBV, HCV, HDV, and HIV markers; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV DNA; and liver biopsy and immunoperoxidase. During the follow-up, 20 of the 184 patients cleared serum HBsAg. A comparison of patients with persistent HBsAg(group I) and of those who cleared this marker (group II) showed a significant difference in mortality (P = 0.002) between the two groups and a tendency to a more severe exacerbation (flare) in group II (P = 0.07). Antibodies to hepatitis C and D virus as well as antibodies to HIV were equally distributed in both groups. Thirteen patients (7.9%) from group I, but none from group II, subsequently developed hepatocellular carcinoma. These results suggest that the frequency of spontaneous clearance of HBsAg during chronic HBV infection is low. No determinant factor for the clearance was found, including the presence of liver cirrhosis. Serum HBV DNA was undetectable by PCR after clearance in 16 out of 17 patients."

However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."

The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV booster vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals."

Previous treatment options for HCV were limited to pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV), a combination that demonstrated lower successful cure rates in genotype 1 HCV mono-infection and HIV/HCV co-infection, and is also associated with a considerable adverse side-effect profile. The development of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) offers the first class of drug to achieve good viral suppression in previously hard-to-treat patient groups.

There is little information on the management and outcome of the children exposed to and injured by medical waste. On 15 September 1999, 54 children where involved in a mass exposure incident. 44 presented the same evening and 10 following day. Used needles and syringes were discarded on their soccer field. Children gave one another injections and played darts with the discarded needles. Parents were counselled and blood was drawn for HIV and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology. All were given HBV vaccination (HBVV). Stat doses of zidovudine (ZDV) and lamivudine (LMV) were given to all with visible wounds or history of percutaneous injury. Younger children were given prophylaxis as we considered their histories unreliable. Further visits were conducted at the community clinic for patient convenience. Children were reviewed at weeks 1 and 3 for drug adherence and side effects. At week 4, the second HBVV was given. At 3 months and 6 months HIV and HBV serology were repeated. 18/44 (40 per cent) had entry wounds. 44/54 (81 per cent) were given antiretroviral treatment (ART). Initial screening for HIV was negative in all, 6 had antibodies to HBV surface antigen, and 2 were HBV surface antigen positive. At week 1 all patients on ART were seen but at week 3 only 30 (55 per cent) attended. 41 (75 per cent) attended at 4 weeks, 8 non-attendees being located by primary healthcare workers. At 3 months, none of the 35 (64 per cent) children had seroconverted for either virus. 44 (81 per cent) attended at 6 months and all serology was negative. All were also Hepatitis C negative. The exposure incident sensitized the community to HIV. Follow up of patients after mass exposure is difficult and time-consuming. Adherence to ART was poor and should be carefully monitored.

Ganciclovir was administered intravenously at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg/d and then increased to 10 mg/kg/d. Immunosuppressive drug therapy was maintained at low levels. There were no major side effects of ganciclovir therapy. Serum HBV DNA levels decreased by a mean of 90% (range, 42% to 100%), and four of nine patients had no measurable HBV DNA at the completion of therapy. Mean serum alanine aminotransferase levels decreased by 83%. Hepatic expression of HBV antigens and HBV DNA was assessed before and after therapy in six patients and found to be reduced in three patients. The histology activity index was also stabilized or improved in all patients. After discontinuation of therapy, four of nine patients underwent retreatment for 4- to 12-fold elevation of serum HBV DNA and/or biochemical and clinical relapse, that was severe in one patient. This pilot study shows the safety and efficacy of ganciclovir therapy for reducing HBV replication in patients with HBV infection after liver transplantation."
1872,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."
571,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of a G1862T variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been investigated in patients with fulminant hepatitis and chronic liver disease, using primer mismatch amplification, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This variant was five times more common in patients with fulminant hepatitis (13.7%, 7 of 52) than in chronic carriers (2.5%, 2 of 81). The G-->T substitution at position 1862 leads to an amino acid change in codon 17 of the precore protein of the virus, which is part of a signal peptidase recognition motif. Variants with this mutation were only seen in patients infected with genotype B. In vitro translation experiments showed that this variant has greatly reduced capacity to produce hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from its precore protein precursor. Furthermore, 88.5% of patients with fulminant hepatitis had mutations that are known to be associated with abrogated or reduced production of HBeAg. This suggests that, following HBV infection, the absence or reduced amounts of HBeAg may be a contributing factor in fulminant disease."
9607,0.001,1.0000,"To assess the role of naturally occurring basic amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype E on viral coreceptor usage and cell tropism, we have constructed a panel of chimeric viruses with mutant V3 loops of HIV-1 subtype E in the genetic background of HIV-1LAI. The arginine substitutions naturally occurring at positions 8, 11, and 18 of the V3 loop in an HIV-1 subtype E X4 strain were systematically introduced into that of an R5 strain to generate a series of V3 loop mutant chimera. These chimeric viruses were employed in virus infectivity assays using HOS-CD4 cells expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T-cell lines, or macrophages. The arginine substitution at position 11 of the V3 loop uniformly caused the loss of infectivity in HOS-CD4-CCR5 cells, indicating that position 11 is critical for utilization of CCR5. CXCR4 usage was conferred by a minimum of two arginine substitutions, regardless of combination, whereas arginine substitutions at position 8 and 11 were required for T-cell line tropism. Nonetheless, macrophage tropism was not conferred by the V3 loop of subtype E R5 strain per se. We found that the specific combinations of amino acid changes in HIV-1 subtype E env V3 loop are critical for determining viral coreceptor usage and cell tropism. However, the ability to infect HOS-CD4 cells through either CXCR4 or CCR5 is not necessarily correlated with T-cell or macrophage tropism, suggesting that cellular tropism is not dictated solely by viral coreceptor utilization."
3972,0.001,1.0000,"We sought to predict virus coreceptor utilization using a simple bioinformatics method based on genotypic analysis of human immunodeficiency virus types 1 (HIV-1) env V3 loop sequences of 28 infected but drug-naive women during pregnancy and their infected infants and to better understand coreceptor usage in vertical transmission dynamics. The HIV-1 env V3 loop was sequenced from plasma samples and analyzed for viral coreceptor usage and subtype in a cohort of HIV-1-infected pregnant women. Predicted maternal frequencies of the X4, R5X4, and R5 genotypes were 7%, 11%, and 82%, respectively. Antenatal plasma viral load was higher, with a mean log(10) (SD) of 4.8 (1.6) and 3.6 (1.2) for women with the X4 and R5 genotypes, respectively, p = 0.078. Amino acid substitution from the conserved V3 loop crown motif GPGQ to GPGR and lymphadenopathy were associated with the X4 genotype, p = 0.031 and 0.043, respectively. The maternal viral coreceptor genotype was generally preserved in vertical transmission and was predictive of the newborn's viral genotype. Infants born to mothers with X4 genotypes were more likely to have lower birth weights relative to those born to mothers with the R5 genotype, with a mean weight (SD) of 2870 (±332) and 3069 (±300) g, respectively. These data show that at least in HIV-1 subtype C, R5 coreceptor usage is the most predominant genotype, which is generally preserved following vertical transmission and is associated with the V3 GPGQ crown motif. Therefore, antiretroviral-naive pregnant women and their infants can benefit from ARV combination therapies that include R5 entry inhibitors following prediction of their coreceptor genotype using simple bioinformatics methods."
1845,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was once thought to be a relative or even absolute contraindication to transplantation. With the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those infected with HIV are now living longer and dying from illnesses other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents. In this review, kidney, liver, and heart transplantation in the HIV-positive population were analyzed using data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network/ Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients."
2539,0.001,1.0000,"Current product labels for maraviroc and raltegravir provide no dosing guidance for patients with end-stage liver disease and worsening renal function. We describe a 41-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and rapidly progressive liver failure and vanishing bile duct syndrome at presentation. Despite discontinuation of all potential offending drugs, the patient's liver function continued to deteriorate. To achieve and maintain HIV suppression while awaiting liver transplantation, a regimen consisting of maraviroc, raltegravir, and enfuvirtide was started. These agents were chosen because the patient was not exposed to them before the onset of liver failure. While receiving product label-recommended twice-daily dosing of these drugs, he achieved and maintained HIV suppression. During a complicated and prolonged hospitalization, the patient also developed renal dysfunction. As hepatic metabolism is the primary route of clearance of maraviroc and raltegravir, we predicted that using approved doses of these drugs could result in significant drug accumulation. Since the safety profiles of supratherapeutic concentrations of these agents are not well defined, we chose to use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide further dosing. The reported concentrations showed severely impaired metabolic clearance of both drugs, with markedly prolonged elimination half-lives of 189 hours for maraviroc and 61 hours for raltegravir. Previously reported half-lives for maraviroc and raltegravir in HIV-infected patients with normal hepatic and renal function are 14-18 hours and 9-12 hours, respectively. Based on these results, the dosing intervals were extended from twice/day to twice/week for maraviroc and every 48 hours for raltegravir. Unfortunately, the patient's clinical condition continued to deteriorate, and he eventually died of complications related to end-stage liver disease. This case illustrates the difficulties in managing antiretroviral therapy in an HIV-infected patient with combined severe liver and renal failure. Prolonged excessively high exposure to maraviroc and raltegravir is likely to result in some level of concentration-dependent toxicity. Until more data are available, therapeutic drug monitoring remains the only evidence-based approach to optimize dosage selection of these drugs in this patient population."
8387,0.001,1.0000,"Parenteral drug abusers are the second largest group at risk for developing AIDS (25% of US cases) and a major risk group for infection with both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the HBV-dependent RNA hepatitis delta virus (HDV). This study was conducted to determine the prevalence in 1984-1985 and relationships of HDV and HBV infections in 372 unselected parenteral drug abusers without AIDS or symptoms related to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (but 49% of whom were positive for HIV-1 antibodies) and in 53 drug abusers hospitalized with AIDS. The prevalence of HDV markers in the combined study groups was 20%; 81% of study subjects with hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg) had one marker for HDV infection. Significant differences were found between patients with and without AIDS with respect to the prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen (5.7% vs. 0.8%, P less than .05) and antibody (0 vs. 21.4%, P less than .01) and HBsAg (15.1% vs. 5.1%, P less than .05). The significantly higher prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen and HBsAg in subjects with AIDS suggests that persistence or reactivation of these viruses is significantly greater among parenteral drug abusers with AIDS than among those without AIDS. These findings, along with the absence of hepatitis delta antibodies in the drug abusers with AIDS, are probably related to the profound general immunosuppression that occurs in AIDS."
7753,0.001,1.0000,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), Torque teno virus (TTV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Surakarta, Indonesia, and the risk factors and sexual behavior associated with these infections. A cross sectional study was performed from October 2009 to October 2011 among 143 MSM by face-to-face interviews to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects were tested for ,HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2 and toxoplasma infection using serology and for TTV using molecular detection. The seropositive rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HTLV-1/2, IgM anti-T. gondii, IgG anti-T, gondii and TTV DNA were 9.1%, 9.8%, 28.0%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 30.8%, and 26.6%, respectively. Risk factors associated with HIV infection were a history of injecting drug use (IDU) [adjusted OR (aOR) 6.0; 95% CI: 1.10-33.01] and a receptive role in sexual activity (aOR 8.1; 95% CI: 1.30-50.04) [corrected]. Having a tattoo (aOR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-7.98) and practicing both anal and vaginal sex without a condom (aOR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92) were associated with toxoplasma infection. A history of IDU (aOR 32; 95% CI: 5.93-177.93) was associated with TTV infection. The subjects examined in this study were found to be infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2, TTV, and T. gondii.

6356,0.001,1.0000,"In this study, we tested 137 Turkish children with cancer (51 with acute leukemia, 48 with lymphoma, 38 with solid tumors) while they were undergoing chemotherapy, and a control group of 45 for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The control group included children with other disease who had applied to the outpatient clinic during the study period and had no history of jaundice or transfusion. Sixty-five (47.4%) patients with cancer and 7 (20%) children in the control group were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (p < 0.01). HBV DNA was detected in 59 (43.1%) patients and in 9 (20%) controls (p < 0.01). HCV specific antibody (anti-HCV) was detected in 8 (5.8%) patients and in 1 (2.2%) control (p > 0.05). Eight patients (5.8%) had circulating HCV RNA, but none had in the control group (p = 0.09). Ten (13.9%) of the 72 patients who were negative for HBsAg had circulating HBV DNA, and 7 (5.4%) of the 129 patients who were negative for anti-HCV had circulating HCV RNA. We concluded that HBV and HCV infections are common among Turkish children with cancer. In countries where HBV infection is widespread among the general population as in Turkey, children with cancer are under greater risk for HBV infection."
331,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence and risk factors of hepatitis A, B, and C (HAV, HBV, and HCV) markers were compared in non-Roma and Roma children who lived in a deprived suburb of Athens, Greece. The study included 216 children, 118 Roma and 98 non-Roma of 9 years median age (range 5-15 years). Among Roma children 98.3% had detectable antibodies to HAV, compared with 32.7% among non-Romas (P < 0.0001). Regarding HBV, 22% Roma children were identified with evidence of past infection (anti-HBc(+)), among whom five (4% of the total) were chronic carriers (HBsAg(+)), whereas no past infection was detected among the non-Romas (P < 0.0001). Markers of past HBV vaccination (anti-HBs(+), anti-HBc(-)) were detected in only 14% Roma but 96% non-Roma children (P-value < 0.0001). There was some indication for intrafamilial transmission of HAV and HBV in Roma school children. Unfavorable living conditions, frequent residency change, lack of child insurance and primary healthcare delivery were significantly associated with seroprevalence of HBV infection among Romas. No child in either group was found positive for HCV markers. These findings document high socioeconomic differentials with regards to preventable communicable diseases, such as HAV and HBV and underline the need for enhancing health policy action targeting pockets of minority childhood populations. Whereas, uptake of HBV vaccination is rather optimal in this general population, the high seroprevalence of HAV among Romas, also calls for implementing general vaccination for HAV, early in life."
7221,0.001,1.0000,"Delivery by elective cesarean section (ECS), cesarean section prior to labor and rupture of membranes, is associated with a lower rate of vertical transmission of HIV compared with other modes of delivery. The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."
9878,0.001,1.0000,"AY 9944 [AY; trans-1,4-bis(chlorobenzylaminomethyl)-cyclohexane dihydrochloride], an inhibitor of sterol synthesis, was found to help restore the normal mitogenic responses and cytokine profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AIDS patients in vitro. Compared to untreated cells, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected PBMCs precultured in the presence of AY exhibited a normal rate of either mitogen-induced or recall- and superantigen-induced proliferation. After 2 weeks in the presence of the drug, the percentage of dead CD4(+) cells in HIV-1-infected cultures was comparable to that observed in uninfected cultures, while over the same time interval it increased by three- to fivefold in HIV-1-infected cultures maintained in the absence of AY. AY also stimulated by 2- to 12-fold interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (gamma interferon production. For IL-12, this effect appears to be related to an increase in corresponding IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. Moreover, AY restored the expression of the IL-2 receptor, which was severely impaired in HIV-1-infected PBMCs. Although the drug has no direct antiviral effect (it does not significantly inhibit reverse transcriptase activity measured in vitro), it might be considered a potential therapeutic agent for HIV-infected patients, in that it may correct viral infection-related immune system defects by indirectly enhancing the level of resistance to HIV and opportunistic infections."
2742,0.001,1.0000,"Previous studies have revealed antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) levels as a predictor of treatment response in hepatitis B early antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in both interferon and nucleos(t)ide analog therapy cohorts. However, there is no information about anti-HBc levels in the natural history of CHB. This study aimed to define anti-HBc levels of different phases in the natural history of CHB. Two hundred eleven treatment-naive CHB patients were included in the study. They were classified into 4 phases: immune tolerance (IT) phase (n = 39), immune clearance (IC) phase (n = 48), low or no-replicative (LR) phase (n = 55), and HBeAg-negative hepatitis (ENH, n = 69). Fifty patients who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive were also recruited as past HBV infection (PBI) control group. Anti-HBc levels were measured by a newly developed double-sandwich immunoassay. Correlation of anti-HBc levels with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and other HBV-related markers within each phase was performed. Serum anti-HBc levels were statistically significant between patients in different phases of CHB (P < 0.001). The median anti-HBc levels were: IT (3.17 log 10 IU/mL), IC (4.39 log 10 IU/mL), LR (3.29 log 10 IU/mL), ENH (4.12 log 10 IU/mL), and PBI (0.61 log 10 IU/mL). There existed a strong correlation in IC (r = 0.489, P < 0.001), a poor correlation in ENH (r = 0.275, P = 0.042), and no correlation in patients with ALT reached 5 times upper limit of normal (r = 0.120, P = 0.616). Anti-HBc levels show significant differences during the natural course of CHB. These results may provide some potentially useful insights into hepatitis B pathogenesis and immune activation against hepatitis B virus."
9807,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is an important public health concern worldwide, especially in developing countries, causing waterborne outbreaks as well as sporadic autochthonous hepatitis. China is usually considered to be a HEV-endemic area, but the prevalence of HEV infection in children in mainland China remains unclear. Between May 2013 and July 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence and potential risk factors associated with the acquisition of HEV infection by children in China. A total of 1,500 healthy children (range 1-18; 942 and 558 from urban and rural areas, respectively) were recruited to examine for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics from the examined children were obtained. The overall seroprevalence of HEV in the examined children was 14.93%. Of these, 174 (11.60%) were positive for only anti-HEV IgG antibodies, 50 (3.33%) were IgM positive and IgG negative, and 44 (2.93%) were positive for both anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies. Age, type of residence area, contact with pigs, and source of drinking water were found to be associated with HEV infection. These findings demonstrated the high prevalence of HEV and the considerable potential for the transmission of HEV infection in children in China."
9766,0.001,1.0000,"Two methods were used to unveil a possible previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis. The anamnestic response to a booster injection of HB vaccine was assessed, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for the detection of HBV-DNA in serum and liver tissue, using primers to span the precore and core regions, was employed. Seventeen patients with postnecrotic liver cirrhosis were selected from a population with a high prevalence of HBV infection and were compared with 11 liver cirrhosis patients who were positive for antibodies to surface antigen (anti-HBs) IgG antibodies. All patients were given one dose of HB vaccine into the deltoid muscle, and anti-HBs titers were measured 1 and 4 wk after injection. Three of 17 patients, initially negative for anti-HBs, showed a primary response, with titers of anti-HBs rising from 0 to a maximum of 85 mIU/ml after 4 wk; the rest had no response. Of the 11 patients positive for anti-HBs, of whom nine were also IgG anti-HBs positive, only four had an intense anamnestic response, with anti-HBs titers rising to more than 10 times the initial values (up to 10,800 mIU/ml). Serum HBV-DNA was detected in eight patients in the antibody-negative group and in only one patient in the antibody-positive group (p less than 0.02). None of the four patients with positive anamnestic response had HBV-DNA in the serum. The prevalence of HBV-DNA in the liver was similar in both groups. Absence of HBV-DNA in serum of most patients positive for anti-HBs supports the hypothesis that HBV particles released from the liver may be captured by antibodies in the serum. We conclude that assessment of the anamnestic response to HB vaccine has no diagnostic advantage, compared with direct measurement of conventional HBV serological markers in patients with liver cirrhosis. Moreover, we suggest that this type of immunologic response may not occur when virion-associated HBV-DNA is present in the serum."

B, C, and D Hepatitis viruses serological markers were checked retrospectively on 363 stored plasma. For HBV, the Abbott laboratories equipment IMx was used to detect HBs Ag and anti Core Ab on negative HBs Ag samples. For HDV, anti Delta Ab was performed using the Abbott Murex Kit on all HBs Ag positive samples. For HCV, anti HCV Ab was detected by IMx as double screening test and confirmed by INNO-LIA(TM) HCV Core of Innogenetics laboratories. The statistical analysis was done with STATA V8. The study population was composed of 164 men and 199 women aged between 16 and 66 years. The immune and virological markers averages at their enrollment were 154 cell/mm(3) for TLCD4+ (n = 355 patients) and 4.9 log for viral load (n = 277 patients). HBs Ag was found in 61 patients or 16.8% and the prevalence of anti-HBc Ab was 83.2% (252/295). 2 patients or 3% on HBs Ag positive sample presents HBV/HDV co-infection Ab anti HCV was detects in 6 patients or 1.6% after confirmation and 2 patients had triple infection with HBV. These results showed that the prevalence of HBV and HCV in the population of persons living with HIV/AIDS in Senegal is similar to that found in the general population. Our data indicated that hepatitis pathology in the PLwHIV was essentially due to HBV. Further studies are needed to diagnose occult hepatitis in order to set up therapeutic strategies taking into account co-infections by hepatitis viruses in the ART programmes."
7332,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) remain among the most common disorders in people infected with HIV, even in an era when potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. This review discusses the clinical features of HANDs and the implications for more effective treatment. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions are increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. This review attempts to answer why there appears to be a therapeutic gap between the salutary effects of antiretroviral regimens and normalization of neurological function. A second gap is found in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HANDs. This review addresses this and discusses the animal models that have helped to elucidate these mechanisms. Although triggered by productive HIV infection of brain macrophages, aberrant and sustained immune activation appears to play a major role in inducing HANDs, and may explain the often incomplete neurological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Novel therapies aimed at persistent central nervous system inflammation will be needed to close this gap."

This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients."

Ten HLA-A2+, HIV+ asymptomatic patients with CD4+ T cells >500/mm3 were given two courses of HIV-1 MN rgp160 vaccine over a 2-year period. Envelope epitope-specific CTL responses, using PBMCs, were measured against peptide-coated autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines. Optimum CTL epitopes were determined by HLA-A2-binding affinity of 9- to 10-mer peptides containing the HLA-A2.1-binding motif. Ten of the high- or intermediate-binding peptides were conserved among >50% of reported clade B HIV strains. These peptide-specific CTL activities and the patient virus sequences in peptide-coding regions were monitored. Six patients showed envelope peptide-specific CTL responses, which correlated with the presence of whole envelope antigen-specific CTL responses. Five of these patients, who showed responses to epitopes in the gp41 region (aa 814-824), had preimmunization virus similar to the vaccine sequence in this region. Three patients who did not show these epitope-specific responses had initially different sequences in the HIV gene encoding that region. The epitope-specific CTL responses appear to reflect recall responses, as only patients infected with virus containing the vaccine sequence developed them and they could be recalled with a second set of vaccine injections. This appears to be reminiscent of the concept of T cell ""original antigenic sin."" This vaccine was also immunogenic as measured by gp160-specific lymphocyte-proliferative responses. However, increased immune responses did not impact the HIV load or CTL epitope sequences during therapy."
7940,0.001,1.0000,"Recent evidence suggests that primary patient isolates of T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 ) have lower affinities for CD4 than their laboratory-adapted derivatives, that this may partly result from tighter gp120-gp41 bonds that constrain the CD4 binding sites of the primary viruses, and that selection for increased CD4 affinity may be the principal factor in laboratory adaptation of HIV-1 (S. L. Kozak, E. J. Platt, N. Madani, F. E. Ferro, Jr., K. Peden, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 71:873-882, 1997). These conclusions were based on studies with a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that differ in CD4 levels over a broad range, with laboratory-adapted viruses infecting all clones with equal efficiencies and primary T-cell-tropic viruses infecting the clones in proportion to cellular CD4 levels. Additionally, all of the primary and laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic viruses efficiently used CXCR-4 (fusin) as a coreceptor. To test these conclusions by an independent approach, we studied mutations in the laboratory-adapted virus LAV/IIIB that alter the CD)4 binding region of gp120 and specifically reduce CD4 affinities of free gp 120 by 85 to 98% (U. Olshevsky et al., J. Virol. 64:5701-5707, 1990). These mutations reduced virus titers to widely varying extents that ranged from severalfold to several orders of magnitude and converted infectivities on the HeLa-CD4 panel from CD4 independency to a high degree of CD4 dependency that resembled the behavior of primary patient viruses. The relative infectivities of the mutants correlated closely with their sensitivities to inactivation by soluble CD4 but did not correlate with the relative CD4 affinities of their free gp120s. Most of the mutations did not substantially alter envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing, expression on cell surfaces, incorporation into virions, or rates of gp120 shedding from virions. However, one mutation (D457R) caused a decrease in gp160 processing by approximately 80%. The fact that several mutations increased rates of spontaneous viral inactivation (especially D368P) suggests that HIV-1 life spans may be determined by structural stabilities of viral envelope glycoproteins. All of the wild-type and mutant viruses were only slowly and inefficiently adsorbed onto cultured CD4-positive cells at 37 degrees C, and the gradual declines in viral titers in the media were caused almost exclusively by spontaneous inactivation rather than by adsorption. The extreme inefficiency with which infectious HIV-1 is able to infect cultured susceptible CD4-positive cells in standard assay conditions casts doubt on previous inferences that the vast majority of retrovirions produced in cultures are noninfectious. Apparent infectivity of T-cell-tropic HIV-1 in culture is limited by productive associations with CD4 and is influenced in an interdependent manner by CD4 affinities of viral gp120-gp41 complexes and quantities of cell surface CD4."
9543,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is much less pathogenic than HIV-1, and HIV-2 infection is associated with plasma viral loads significantly lower than those found in HIV-1 infection. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR method for measuring the HIV-2 RNA load that covers the range of genetic diversity of HIV-2 isolates and that detects extremely low viral loads. Samples from 49 patients were studied. Proviral DNA was first detected and quantified. The strains that were detected were then genotyped: 21 patients were infected with HIV-2 subtype A and 15 patients were infected with HIV-2 subtype B; 1 patient was infected with a highly divergent strain. Env PCR failed for the remaining 12 patients, so subtypes could not be determined. For viral RNA quantification, a stock of HIV-2 strain NIHZ, which was counted by electron microscopy, was used as the standard. Several primer sets targeting the highly conserved gag region were evaluated. Various primer combinations failed to amplify subtype B strains. With the final primer pair selected, which detected both subtype A and subtype B strains, the sensitivity of the assay was 100% at a viral load of 250 copies/ml and 66% at a viral load of 125 copies/ml. We found a correlation between the CD4(+)-cell count, the clinical stage, and the plasma HIV-2 RNA level. The median plasma HIV-2 RNA value for the 33 asymptomatic patients was 2.14 log(10), whereas it was 3.1 log(10) for the 16 patients with AIDS (P < 0.01). Proviral DNA was detectable in 18 symptom-free patients with high CD4(+)-cell counts, in whom viral RNA was undetectable."

Subjects included 82 women 18 years of age or older who were currently seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic. The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population. Quality of life information can assist programme planners in developing social and medical service delivery for women in the community thus facilitating the development of treatments, programmes and interventions aimed at increasing quality of life for this population."

Surveillance databases including persons reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with HIV, HBV, and HCV by 31 December 2010 and not known to be dead as of 1 January 2000, were matched with 2000-2011 vital statistics mortality data. Of 140 606 persons reported with HIV, 4% were co-infected with HBV only, 15% were co-infected with HCV only, and 1% were co-infected with HBV and HCV. In all groups, 70-80% were male. The most common race/ethnicity and HIV transmission risk groups were non-Hispanic blacks and men who have sex with men (MSM) for HIV/HBV infection, and non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and injection drug users for HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV infections. The overall age-adjusted 2000-2011 mortality was higher in co-infected than HIV mono-infected individuals. Use of population-based surveillance data provided a comprehensive characterization of HIV co-infection with HBV and HCV. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeting HIV and viral hepatitis testing and prevention efforts to populations at risk for co-infection, and of integrating HIV and viral hepatitis care and testing services."
6505,0.001,1.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) and HIV infection are important public health problems in Vietnam. The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."

Markers of HBV infection in pregnant women and infants were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that 13 infants were detected positive for HBsAg in their sera, eight of them were positive at their birth and the other five converted positive during follow-up.

We describe an HBsAg-positive leukemia patient who successfully underwent autologous PBSC transplant. After chemotherapeutic treatment his serum HBV DNA level rose in association with hepatitis. To prevent progression to fulminant hepatitis, we administered lamivudine, a viral reverse transcriptase inhibitor, during the transplantation procedure. The patient did not show any increase of HBV DNA or a worsening of his hepatitis. Thus, lamivudine may be a promising treatment for HBsAg-positive patients receiving myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation."

Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
68,0.001,1.0000,"The authors have successfully used combination ganciclovir and foscarnet chemotherapy to control viral replication following liver transplantation in a patient with severe recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The disease was characterized by extremely high viraemias, deteriorating liver function, and high levels of intra-hepatic hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Treatment resulted in a greater than 30-fold reduction in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels. Liver function tests returned to normal and the histological progression of the disease was arrested. Hepatic cytoplasmic HBsAg decreased substantially but there was little change in HBcAg, implicating HBsAg rather than HBcAg in the liver injury. Combination antiviral chemotherapy using agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet may offer a new approach to the management of post-transplant recurrence of HBV."

The results of the present study show that 7.2%, 13.0%, and 7.4% of injecting drug users seeking treatment at public drug dependency centres are not tested for, respectively, HIV, HBV and HCV infections and while corresponding figures for drug users who do not inject drugs are 20.3%, 25.1% and 16.2%. The failure to undergo testing among injectors was associated with a shorter history of drug use and with drug centres in central or southern Italy; these associations were also found among non-injectors, with the addition of low level of education. The results stress the importance of facilitating access to testing, of providing the drug dependency centres with the necessary resources for taking blood samples at the centres themselves, of making access to (and performance of) testing uniform throughout the country, and of removing obstacles that can lead to the drug user's refusal to undergo testing."
8946,0.001,1.0000,"To derive guidelines for a safer bone marrow transplantation (BMT) policy, we have to study pre-BMT risk factors that may be associated with an increased post-BMT death. Among those factors, the importance of pre-BMT viral hepatitis markers in BMT donors and recipients remains unsettled. In the present study, we have determined the effect of prior donor and recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure on the incidence of those viral infections after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The study included 63 patients presented to the BMT unit; 28 of them underwent transplantation and 35 were not transplanted. All serum markers of CMV, HBV, and HCV infections were monitored using ELISA technique, as well as PCR-DNA for CMV, HBV and HCV RT-PCR techniques for HCV. The incidence of active CMV and HCV was 11/28 (39%) and 6/28 (21%) in post-BMT recipients compared to 2/35 (6%) and 2/35 (6%) in the 35 untransplanted patients (P=0.00003 and P=0.05). Whereas active HBV infection was non significantly (P=0.13) higher 3/28 (11%) in the BMT patients in comparison to 1/35 (3%) in untransplanted patients. Ten out of the 19 (53%) of the CMV-seropositive recipients developed CMV reactivation compared to 1/9 (11%) of the CMV-seronegative recipients who developed CMV seroconversion. In addition, 3/8 (38%) of the HBV-seropositive recipients developed HBV reactivation in comparison to 0/20 of the HBV-seronegative recipients. Moreover, 5/13 (39%) of the HCV-seropositive recipients developed HCV reactivation in comparison to 1/16 (6%) of the HCV-seronegative recipients who developed HCV seroconversion. In conclusion, previous exposure to CMV, HBV, and HCV infections in the recipients of BMT patients were found to influence the risk of developing those viral infections."

The objective of our retrospective analysis was to evaluate the eligibility and feasibility of anti-HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients followed at the II Department of Infectious Diseases, L. Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, from 2000 to March 2010. In our database, 545 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were present, representing 40% of our whole HIV population, and 421 included in the analysis. One hundred twenty-four patients were excluded because of loss to follow-up (81) or deceased (43). Forty-eight patients spontaneously cleared HCV during follow-up (11%). Ninety-nine patients received anti-HCV therapy (26%), while the majority was excluded for several reasons (mainly concomitant diseases and low CD4(+) cell count). Globally, we found that in at least one third of untreated patients modifiable barriers to treatment were present. The access to therapy was significantly associated with the absence of history of intravenous drug use (p=0.01), a higher CD4(+) cells count at nadir (p=0.01), the presence of more than 6 HAART regimens (p=0.04), higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p<0.0001), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p=0.005). In a multivariate analysis, the same factors remained significantly associated with anti-HCV therapy. In conclusion, the feasibility of anti-HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, in our highly specialized center, is approximately 26%. Relative contraindications, such as substance abuses, mild and controlled concomitant conditions, and low compliance are common and modifiable in order to reconsider patients as suitable for therapy."
1737,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
7105,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been a tremendous health burden worldwide with an annual mortality of 300,000 people due to decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. A combination of interferon (IFN), ribavirin (RBV), and/or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) can eradicate HCV in a various proportion of infected patients. Unfortunately, IFN-based therapy is associated with significant adverse effects, contraindications, and limited tolerability, leading to lower adherence or even treatment discontinuation. With the rapid evolution of newer DAAs or host-targeting agents, emerging HCV therapy is moving towards an IFN- and RBV-free strategy. To this end, a recently developed NS3 protease inhibitor, asunaprevir (ASV), in combination with other DAAs as IFN/RBV-containing or -free regimen, has shown promising results with fewer adverse effects. In this review, preclinical profiles and clinical proof-of-concept studies of ASV, including viral resistance, host polymorphism, and role of ASV in future HCV therapy are reviewed and discussed. "

A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of oral lesions in a cohort of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART, to compare these data with the prevalence of lesions prior to HAART and to correlate these finding with the immunologic data. A total of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART were selected. Oral lesions associated with HIV infection and immunological parameters were registered. On re-examination 6 months after the first evaluation, 61/103 patients were available. Comparing the prevalence of oral lesions before and after the onset of HAART, the number of oral lesions was significantly lower (P=0.001). The number of CD4+ cells increased and the viral load decreased significantly after initiation of HAART (P=0.001 and P= 0.0001). On re-examination 6 months later, the prevalence of lesions again decreased significantly (P=0.001). The immunological benefits of HAART may prevent HIV-associated oral lesions in patients with advanced HIV disease. Our results showed that oral manifestations decrease on HAART, but in four patients the immunological effects of therapy did not provide sufficient protection against human papillomavirus (HPV)induced lesions."

All 19 HIV-positive lung cancer patients were men. This was significantly (p = 0.004) different from the 69 percent male preponderance in 1,335 HIV-indeterminate lung cancer patients. Median ages of HIV-positive and HIV-indeterminate patients were 48 and 61 years, respectively. HIV-positive patients were significantly (p = 0.0139) younger. Stage distribution was similar in both groups. Histologic features and smoking were not significantly different between the two groups. Survival data that were available in 16 HIV-positive patients were compared with 32 HIV-indeterminate control subjects matched for stage, age, sex, and race.

In contrast, treatment with telbivudine (LdT) improves renal function in CHB patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the renoprotective effect of LdT in CHB patients receiving ADV-based combination therapy. The effects of treatment with ADV + LdT on renal function were compared to those resulting from treatment with ADV + entecavir (ETV), ADV + lamivudine (LAM), ADV alone and ETV alone. The consecutive cohort analysis included 831 CHB patients who received ADV + LdT, ADV + LAM, ADV + ETV, ADV alone or ETV alone for 96 weeks. Alterations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared between the five groups using a linear mixed-effects model. HBV DNA levels were also compared between the five groups during the 96-week period. Among the five treatment groups, significant improvements in eGFR were observed in the ADV + LdT and ADV + LAM groups over time (P < 0.001 for each group compared with baseline eGFR). In patients with a baseline eGFR between 50 and 90 mL/min, the change in eGFR was the most significant in the ADV + LdT group (+0.641 mL/min; P < 0.001). Age, gender, baseline eGFR and treatment option were significant predictive factors for eGFR changes. In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination therapy of LdT and ADV is significantly associated with renoprotective effects in CHB patients when compared with other ADV-based combination or single therapies.

Significantly decreased plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC) counts in the blood of RPs were observed at study entry as compared with TPs and healthy HIV-1-negative subjects. Low baseline pDC counts were significantly associated with rapid disease progression after adjustment for baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, mDC counts, and HIV-1 load. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that low pDC counts were strongly associated with rapid disease progression.

Based on in silico studies, two mutant PRs harboring hydrophilic mutations, capable of forming favorable inter- and intra-subunit interactions, were selected: PR(RE) containing Asp25Arg and Gly49Glu mutations, and PR(RER) containing an additional Ile50Arg mutation. The mutants were expressed and tested by PR assays, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cell culture experiments. The mutant PRs showed dose-dependent inhibition of the wild-type PR in a fluorescent microtiter plate PR assay. Furthermore, both mutants were retained by hexahistidine-tagged wild-type HIV-1 PR immobilized on nickel-chelate affinity resin. For the first time, heterodimerization between wild-type and dominant-negative mutant PRs were also demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy. (1)H-(15)N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence NMR spectra showed that although PR(RE) has a high tendency to aggregate, PR(RER) exists mainly as a folded monomer at 25-35 microM concentration, but in the presence of wild-type PR in a ratio of 1:1, heterodimerization occurs with both mutants. While the recombinant virus containing the PR(RE) sequence showed only very low level of expression, expression of the viral proteins of the virus with the PR(RER) sequence was comparable with that of the wild-type. In cell culture experiments, infectivity of viral particles containing PR(RER) protein was reduced by 82%, at mutant to wild-type infective DNA ratio of 2:1."

7712,0.001,1.0000,"There is substantial evidence for ongoing replication and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), even in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Viral evolution in the presence of antiviral therapy needs to be considered when developing new therapeutic strategies. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences can be used for this purpose but may give rise to misleading results if rates of intrapatient evolution differ significantly. To improve analyses of HIV-1 evolution relevant to studies of pathogenesis and treatment, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates all available sequence data while simultaneously allowing the phylogenetic parameters of each patient to vary. We used this method to examine evolutionary changes in HIV-1 coreceptor usage in response to treatment. We examined patients whose viral populations exhibited a shift in coreceptor utilization in response to therapy. CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated. By phylogenetically reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of HIV-1 obtained longitudinally from each patient, it was possible to examine the origin of the reemergent R5 virus. Using our Bayesian hierarchical approach, we found that the reemergent R5 virus detectable after therapy was more closely related to the predecessor R5 virus than to the X4 strains. The Bayesian hierarchical approach, unlike more traditional methods, makes it possible to evaluate competing hypotheses across patients. This model is not limited to analyses of HIV-1 but can be used to elucidate evolutionary processes for other organisms as well."
5987,0.001,1.0000,"Polymorphisms in CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the major coreceptor of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), have a major influence on HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. The effects of these polymorphisms may, in part, account for the differential pathogenesis of HIV-1 (immunosuppression) and SIV (natural resistance) in humans and non-human primates, respectively. Thus, understanding the genetic basis underlying species-specific responses to HIV-1 and SIV could reveal new anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategies for humans. To this end, we compared CCR5 structure/evolution and regulation among humans, apes, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys. The evolution of the CCR5 cis-regulatory region versus the open reading frame as well as among different domains of the open reading frame differed from one another. CCR5 cis-regulatory region sequence variation in humans was substantially higher than anticipated. Based on this variation, CCR5 haplotypes could be organized into seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH) that we designated HHA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G. HHA haplotypes were defined as ancestral to all other haplotypes by comparison to the CCR5 haplotypes of non-human primates. Different human and non-human primate CCR5 haplotypes were associated with differential transcriptional regulation, and various polymorphisms resulted in modified DNA-nuclear protein interactions, including altered binding of members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. We identified novel CCR5 untranslated mRNA sequences that were conserved in human and non-human primates. In some primates, mutations at exon-intron boundaries caused loss of expression of selected CCR5 mRNA isoforms or production of novel mRNA isoforms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the response to HIV-1 and SIV infection in primates may have been driven, in part, by evolution of the elements controlling CCR5 transcription and translation."
2577,0.001,1.0000,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
8979,0.001,1.0000,"In comparison with other Canadian provinces and most Western countries, the province of Manitoba maintains a different vaccination policy for hepatitis B. This policy provides selective antenatal screening for hepatitis B in women and an inoculation program for hepatitis B vaccination for fourth-grade pupils. There has been increasing concern for this policy with regard to its influence on secular trends of acute hepatitis B incidence in Manitoba. This created a need to summarise the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Manitoba and to allocate finances and human resources for future prevention programs. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Canadian Public Health Laboratory, is responsible for testing all specimens for diagnosis of various common infectious diseases in Manitoba. During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission. There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective harm-reduction strategies for hepatitis B prevention among adults (aged 30-34) and groups at risk in Manitoba."
4118,0.001,1.0000,"The rate of HBeAg clearance and the outcome were analyzed in 46 patients with asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection whose condition was followed for 1-4 yr (mean 2.4). Mean age was 32.5 yr (range 10-68), and 28 (61%) were males. All had chronic hepatitis, on biopsy, and were positive for HBcAg on hepatocytes. Alcoholics, homosexuals, drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with advanced liver disease were excluded. During the follow-up, 25 patients (54%) cleared HBeAg and became seronegative for HBV-DNAp. The estimated annual rate of seroconversion was 26%. One patient cleared HBsAg. After seroconversion, 18 patients had no evidence of ongoing liver disease, proved by biopsy in eight and by clinical follow-up in 10 that refused biopsy. A second liver biopsy was available in 15 patients, and HBcAg was negative in all; histology was normal in eight, unchanged in one, and compatible with cirrhosis in six. All six had clinical and/or biochemical evidence of advanced liver disease. These were significantly older at the start of the study, and had chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis on initial biopsy. Early identification of patients with silent chronic HBV infection and high levels of viral replication for antiviral therapy could prevent transmission of the infection and stop progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma."
7821,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and de novo HBV infection are frequent events in liver transplantation recipients. Treatment with lamivudine is initially efficient in both infections but the incidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV emergence increases over time. Adefovir appears to be promising in post-liver transplantation patients with recurrent HBV infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV. This study analyzed adefovir treatment in 42 post-liver transplantation patients who developed recurrent HBV or de novo HBV infection with lamivudine-resistant HBV (54.8% HCV-coinfected). Patients received 10 mg of oral adefovir once daily for a mean period of time of 21.5 months (range from 12 to 31 months). In 62.9% of patients, ALT levels decreased significantly. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 64% of the cases. Twenty percent of patients lost HBeAg marker and 13.3% of them developed anti-HBe. In 9.5% of recipients, HBsAg became negative. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels. In only one patient was worsening of the renal function detected, making dose adjustment necessary. No other side effects were reported. Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of adefovir treatment in post-liver transplantation patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, neither were adefovir-resistant mutations identified in patients after 21 months of therapy, nor were there adverse events, especially renal toxicity."
2968,0.001,1.0000,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
7858,0.001,1.0000,"To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity and to investigate whether plasma concentrations of nevirapine, in addition to other risk factors, could predict hepatotoxicity during treatment with nevirapine-containing regimens, we conducted a retrospective analysis with data from 174 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). During regular visits to the clinic, blood samples were collected for the determination of nevirapine plasma concentrations and clinical chemistry parameters including liver enzymes (LEs) and total bilirubin (TBR). Severe hepatotoxicity was defined as a grade > or =3 elevation in at least one of the tested LEs or TBR levels while on therapy. Analysis of predictive factors was focused on increases in aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) to grade > or =2. Grade > or =3 elevation developed with an incidence of 0.15 per patient year (PY); only 3.4% of the patients developed grade > or =3 values for ASAT and/or ALAT (incidence 0.03 per PY). We found that patients who use a protease inhibitor (PI) in a nevirapine-containing regimen and patients who have chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection are at a higher risk for the development of increases in ASAT and/or ALAT to grade > or =2. In contrast, the plasma concentration of nevirapine does not appear to be a predictive factor in this study population."
3245,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the brains of a majority of patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and has been linked to the development of a progressive dementia termed ""HIV-associated dementia."" This disorder results in severe cognitive, behavioral, and motor deficits. Despite this neurological dysfunction, HIV-1 infection of brain cells does not occur significantly in neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes, but is restricted to brain macrophages and microglia. To identify possible low-level or latent infection of other brain cells, we combined the techniques of the polymerase chain reaction with in situ hybridization for the detection of HIV DNA, and used immunocytochemistry to identify the HIV-expressing cells. In the 21 adult brains studied (15 AIDS and 6 seronegative control brains), we found that polymerase chain reaction/in situ hybridization was both sensitive and specific for identifying HIV-infected cells. In all brains, the majority of infected cells were macrophages and microglia. In several brains, however, a substantial minority of cells harboring HIV DNA were identified as astrocytes. Neurons, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells were not infected with HIV, even in cases with HIV-associated dementia. These findings confirm previous data regarding the importance of macrophage/microglial infection, and essentially exclude neuronal infection in pathogenetic models of HIV-associated neurological disease. These data also demonstrate that latent or low-level infection of astrocytes occurs in AIDS, a finding that may be of importance in understanding HIV neuropathogenesis."
3688,0.001,1.0000,"Two different strains of HIV-1, the lymphotropic HIV-IIIB and the monocytotropic HIV-Ba-L, were able to infect tertiary cultures of astrocytes established from the human embryonic brain. The infection did not require contact with infected cells, as astrocytes were exposed to infectious cell-free supernatants. Except for an early transient peak of p24 consistently observed after infection with HIV-Ba-L, the infection of astrocytes appeared to be nonproductive. However, viral production was always observed when infected astrocytes were cocultured with permissive cells (CEM-SS or monocytes). To exclude the possibility that undetectable levels of virus are chronically produced by astrocytes, we exposed permissive cells to p24 negative supernatants taken from infected cultures. In such conditions permissive cells were never infected. Infection of astrocytes by HIV-1 was further supported by the finding that provirus persisted in these cells. Indeed, by a nested PCR, we detected HIV-1 DNA even one month after infection. Moreover, at the transcriptional level we observed expression of the multiply spliced RNA (tat and nef primers). Noteworthy, this pattern of HIV-1 expression did not change appreciably when astrocytes were pretreated and cultivated in the presence of IL-1 beta. Altogether, our data support the concept that astrocytes may play a role in the spread of HIV-1 infection within the brain and in the pathogenesis of neuro-AIDS."
7413,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection influences natural killer (NK) cell expression of inhibitory NK receptors and activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."
8225,0.001,1.0000,"HIV-1 evolution and the possible emergence of mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral inhibitors have been evaluated in a cohort of sixty-three patients successfully treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (naïve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."
1511,0.001,1.0000,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
3018,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem throughout the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces acute hepatitis with a case-fatality rate of about 1%. Even more important, 5-10% of patients infected with HBV become chronic carries and about 25% of these will die due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The reservoir of HBV chronic carriers in the world is estimated at more than 200 million people and 80% of them reside in Asia and the western Pacific. In high-incidence areas, such as south-east Asia, perinatal transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns appears to be the most important factor for the high prevalence of HBV infection and 70-90% of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers become chronic carriers. Three possibilities of transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns are suggested: (a) transplacental transmission in utero - it was estimated that such transmission occurred in 5-15% of newborns; (b) transmission during delivery, which is considered the main mode of perinatal transmission; (c) postnatal transmission from mother to newborn, which is not common. HBeAg is the main maternal factor in determining whether infection of newborns will occur; the expression of this antigen seems to be determined genetically. Recently it has shown that immunoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing the development of the carrier state in infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers. Only 5-10% of high-risk infants are not protected by vaccination. If it becomes possible to immunize the entire world population including all babies born to carrier mothers at birth, and if our knowledge of the mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HBV is accurate, the carriers and acute cases of HB ought to disappear in two to three generations."
5929,0.001,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS of nursing students in Turkey. HIV/AIDS has become one of the most serious health problems in the world. It is important to understand nursing students' knowledge and attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLHIV) because the educational preparation of nurses has been known to affect the attitudes of the nurse and the effectiveness of the care provided to PLHIV. The study was conducted with 227 nursing students from the School of Health in Antalya, Turkey during the calendar year 2005/2006. Qualitative and quantitative methods were both used to collect data for the study. Analysis of variance, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis and inductive methods were used in data analysis. The majority of nursing students in this study had a moderate level of HIV/AIDS knowledge. Students correctly answered 64.4% of HIV/AIDS-related questions in the questionnaire (Mean 28.99; SD 7.03 out of 45 points). Scores increased parallel with student grade (F=26.925; p=0.000) and age (chi2 (K-W)=35.117; p=0.000). Fear of being infected and feelings of pity and empathy were the feelings most commonly indicated by the students. Students who had previous experience in caring for an AIDS patient and had known someone with HIV/AIDS were willing to care for PLHIV. Results underline the need to strengthen education on all aspects of HIV/AIDS. To improve nursing students willingness to care for PLHIV, particular emphasis should be placed on the training of nursing students as skilled nursing staff with humane attitudes towards PLHIV."
3951,0.001,1.0000,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
7666,0.001,1.0000,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
6590,0.001,1.0000,"The introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in resource-poor settings is effective in suppressing HIV-1 replication and prolonging life of infected individuals. This has led to a demand for affordable HIV-1 drug resistance assays, since treatment failure due to development of drug resistance is common. This study developed and evaluated an affordable ""in-house"" genotyping assay to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in Africa, particularly South Africa. An ""in-house"" assay using automated RNA extraction, and subtype C specific PCR and sequencing primers was developed and successfully evaluated 396 patient samples (viral load ranges 1000-1.6 million RNA copies/ml). The ""in-house"" assay was validated by comparing sequence data and drug resistance profiles from 90 patient and 10 external quality control samples to data from the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping kit. The ""in-house"" assay was more efficient, amplifying all 100 samples, compared to 91 samples using Viroseq. The ""in house"" sequences were 99.2% homologous to the ViroSeq sequences, and identical drug resistance mutation profiles were observed in 96 samples. Furthermore, the ""in-house"" assay genotyped 260 of 295 samples from seven African sites, where 47% were non-subtype C. Overall, the newly validated ""in-house"" drug resistance assay is suited for use in Africa as it overcomes the obstacle of subtype diversity."

These patients received T20 plus an antiretroviral regimen and were followed-up over a period of 40-72 weeks. In one non-responder patient, N43D substitution was detected at 12 weeks of treatment, in association with a value of T20-IC50 of 10 microg/ml (10-fold increase). Double mutations N42T + N43D were observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks and remained detectable up to 16 weeks after the withdrawal of the drug. The S138A substitution in HR2 was observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks, and both in plasma RNA and in PI DNA at 40 weeks, associated with an increase of the T20-IC50 to 25 microg/ml (25-fold increase). Mutations V101G and E137K, not reported previously, were also observed in the HR2 region. Whether these new substitutions play a role in T20 resistance needs to be examined. In three temporary responders, coinciding with viral load rebound, G36D, and N42T substitutions were observed at 12, 24, and 40 weeks. G36D mutation was associated with a value of T20-IC50 of 5 microg/ml. The HR2 S138A mutation was detected after the detection of HR1 substitutions and was associated with an increase in the level of T20-IC50 to 125 microg/ml (125-fold increase) All these data reinforce the role of gp41 amino acids 36-45 and the potential influence of the HR2 S138A mutation in the genotypic/phenotypic resistance to T20."

Our aim was, therefore, to assess the prevalence and clinical consequences of occult HBV infection in chronic hepatitis C patients undergoing antiviral therapy."
283,0.001,1.0000,"To study the relation between general cellular immunity and the course of hepatitis B within a group of chronic hemodialysis patients, T-lymphocyte number and function were investigated in 13 persistently hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg)-positive patients, in 32 HBSAg-negative patients, and in 11 patients who had recovered from hepatitis B and compared with that of 21 age-matched controls. Phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte stimulation in vitro and the number of circulating T-cells in the HBSAg-positive group were significantly decreased as compared with those of the recovered group and the controls. Lymphocyte stimulation by pokeweed mitogen and by an antigen cocktail showed the same tendency, but no significant differences between the HBSAg-positive and the recovered groups. Uremic sera from the three patient groups had similar depressive effects on phytohemagglutinin induced lymphocyte stimulation of controls. Serum immunoglobulin G, (IgG), IgA, and IgM were normal in the three patient groups. It is concluded that chronic hemodialysis patients, who have become persistent HBSAg-carriers, have a significantly decreased T-lymphocyte number and function as compared with hemodialysis patients who are able to eliminat hepatitis B virus (HBV). The difference could not be ascribed to the HBV infection itself. This indicates that T-cells play an important role in the elimination of HBV in hemodialysis patients."

HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."

Although in one patient the rise in HIV-1 RNA might also have been related to the interruption of antiretroviral therapy, we also observed a similar pattern in the other patient who had a stable undetectable plasma viraemia prior to acute hepatitis and never received treatment with anti-retrovirals. Our observation supports the hypothesis that immune activation that is induced by acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection may trigger HIV-1 replication. This highlights the importance of maintaining antiretroviral therapy throughout the acute phase of hepatitis A and of preventing HAV infection through active immunization."

Astrocytes maintain brain homeostasis and respond actively to brain damage by providing functional and nutritive neuronal support. In HAD, low-level, continuous infection of astrocytes occurs, but the functional consequences of this infection are poorly understood. To this end, human fetal astrocytes (HFA) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were infected with HIV-1DJV and HIV-1NL4-3 (neurotropic and lymphotropic strains respectively) and a pseudotyped Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV/HIV-1NL4-3) prior to intracranial injection into the basal ganglia of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Neuropathological and immunohistochemical comparisons for inflammatory and neurotoxic activities were performed amongst the infected cell types at 7 or 14 days. HIV-1-infected MDM induced significant increases in Mac-1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, and proinflammatory cytokine RNA and/or protein expression when compared with HSV/HIV-1- and HIV-1-infected HFA and sham-operated mice. Levels of neuron-specific nuclear protein, microtubule-associated protein 2, and neurofilament antigens were reduced significantly in the brain regions injected with human MDM infected with HIV-1DJV or VSV/HIV-1. We conclude that HIV-1 infection of astrocytes leads to limited neurodegeneration, underscoring the early and active role of macrophage-driven neurotoxicity in disease."
3718,0.001,1.0000,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."
298,0.001,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to investigate the clastogenic activity of plasma ultrafiltrates from HIV-1 infected patients. Clastogenic factors are chromosome-damaging agents with low molecular weight (< 10,000 daltons) which cause chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, DNA strand breakage, and gene mutation. They have first been described in the plasma of irradiated persons, but they are also found in hereditary breakage syndromes and chronic inflammatory diseases with autoimmune reactions. Their formation and their clastogenic effects are modulated by superoxide anion radicals. We analyzed a total of 22 HIV-1 positive patients in comparison to 20 reference plasma samples from healthy HIV negative blood donors of similar age. The plasma ultrafiltrates (filter cutoff 10,000 daltons) from patients induced a statistically significant increase in chromosomal breakage in the cytogenetic test system (20.5 +/- 6.8 aberrations per 100 cells), while no increase was observed in test cultures exposed to plasma ultrafiltrates from healthy blood donors (6.3 +/- 2.9 aberrations per 100 cells). The breakage values were slightly, but not significantly, lower in the 10 patients with more than 200 T-helper cells/ml (18 +/- 4 aberrations per 100 cells), than in the 12 patients with less than 200 T-helper cells/ml (22.3 +/- 7.9 aberrations per 100 cells). HIV patients with high clastogenic activity (induction of more than 20 aberrations per 100 cells, range 20 to 39) showed higher plasma levels for malondialdehyde than those with lower clastogenic activity (less than 20 aberrations per 100 cells, range 12 to 18). However, the difference was statistically not significant. Another lipid peroxidation product, 4-hydroxynonenal, was increased equally in both groups. There were no significant differences in water- and lipid-soluble plasma antioxidants between the low- and high-breakage group. In agreement with previous findings, the clastogenic effects of plasma ultrafiltrates in the test cultures were reduced by the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase. The presence of clastogenic factors in the plasma of HIV patients is further evidence for a prooxidant state in these persons. Since clastogenic factor formation appears to occur at an early stage of the disease, it may be significant for virus release or activation, because of the superoxide anion stimulating effects of clastogenic factors. From a practical standpoint, clastogenic factors may be useful for evaluation of promising drugs."
7843,0.001,1.0000,"Host immunity is important in determining the natural history of HCV infection. Patients with ineffective polyclonal HCV specific CD4+ response are persistently infected and loss of HCV-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with relapse of viraemia. Weak HCV-specific CD4+ response early in the course of chronic hepatitis C correlates with higher rates of fibrosis during subsequent course of the disease. In HIV co-infected patients, the HCV load is higher by an average of 0.5-1 log than the mono-infected patients. Based on the evidence from randomized control trials, the therapy for chronic hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients is pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks irrespective of genotype. In patients with CD4 counts < 200 cells/l and/or plasma HIV RNA above 100,000 copies/ml, it is recommended to administer HAART before HCV therapy. The sustained viral response rate achieved in the HCV/HIV co-infected patients is lower than that for mono-infected patients. Pre-treatment HCV RNA level and the genotype are the best predictors of sustained viral response. Treatment may be discontinued at 12 weeks if there is no early viral response as the likelihood of sustained viral response in this sub-group is only 2%. Biochemical response may not be relevant in HIV/HCV co-infected patients as a third of them have normal pretreatment ALT and normalization of ALT does not correlate with virological clearance. Histological response may not also correlate with virological response as up to 43% of subjects without sustained viral response may show histological improvement at the end of 48 weeks treatment. Liver disease due to HCV in patients with end stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis, is a significant cause of morbidity. The value of aminotransferases in patients on haemodialysis is lower than in the non-uraemic population and the level may not rise above the 'normal' range despite active liver disease. HCV RNA may be required to diagnose HCV infection, as anti-HCV may not be detectable, in such patients. Weekly pegylated interferon may be effective in them. In renal allograft recipients, paired biopsies may show rapid progression of liver disease in the absence of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Interferon is contraindicated in this population due to increased risk of graft rejection. Following liver transplantation, recurrence of HCV is universal and histological evidence of recurrent infection may occur as early as 1 to 8 weeks after transplantation. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin may be effective in them."
7565,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most dangerous malignancies with an increasing incidence and a high mortality rate, represents a major international health problem. HCC progression is known to involve genome-wide alteration of epigenetic modifications, leading to aberrant gene expression patterns. The activity of CYP2C19, an important member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, was reported to be compromised in HCC, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To understand whether epigenetic modification in HCC is associated with a change in CYP2C19 activity, we evaluated the expression levels of CYP2C19 and its transcription factors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using mRNA extracted from both primary hepatocytes and paired tumor versus nontumor liver tissues of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). DNA methylation was examined by bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Our results indicated that CYP2C19 could be regulated by e-box methylation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Decreased CYP2C19 expression in tumorous tissues of HBV-infected patients with HCC was highly correlated with suppressed expression and promoter hypermethylation of CAR. Our study demonstrates that aberrant CAR methylation is involved in CYP2C19 regulation in HBV-related HCC and may play a role in liver tumorigenesis."
7551,0.001,1.0000,"Plasma levels of soluble CD27 (sCD27) are elevated in diseases characterized by T cell activation and are used as a marker of immune activation. We assessed the usefulness of determining plasma sCD27 as a marker for monitoring immune activation in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A first cross-sectional examination of 68 HIV-1-infected and 18 normal subjects showed high levels of sCD27 in HIV-1 infection; plasma sCD27 was correlated to HIV-1 viraemia and inversely correlated to CD4+ T cell count. Twenty-six HIV-1-infected patients undergoing HAART were studied at baseline and after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of therapy. Seven additional patients under HAART were analysed at baseline, during and after interruption of therapy. In the total population, HAART induced a significant and progressive reduction, but not a normalization, of plasma levels of sCD27 after 24 months. A full normalization of plasma sCD27 was observed in the virological responders (undetectable HIV-1 RNA at months 18 and 24) and also in patients with moderate immunodeficiency at baseline (CD4+ T cell count >200 cells/mm3). Changes in plasma neopterin paralleled the changes in sCD27 but only baseline sCD27 levels were predictive of a greater increase in CD4+ T cell count during the follow-up. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in a rapid increase of sCD27 plasma levels associated with viraemia rebound and drop in CD4+ T cell count. Our findings suggest that plasma sCD27 may represent an alternative and simple marker to monitor immune activation during potent antiretroviral therapy. HIV-1-induced immune activation can be normalized by HAART in successfully treated patients where the disease is not advanced."
7128,0.001,1.0000,"To investigate its use as a marker of disease severity, serum soluble CD4 (sCD4) was measured by ELISA in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Levels of sCD4 were higher in patients than in controls (P less than .001) but did not increase with disease severity. sCD4 release per CD4 lymphocyte showed a linear increase with disease severity and performed as well as beta 2-microglobulin, a widely used marker. To study the role of sCD4 in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, an ELISA to detect sCD4 complexed with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV envelope protein was developed. Preformed sCD4-gp120 complexes were not detectable in patient serum, but addition of recombinant gp120 showed that circulating sCD4 is capable of binding HIV envelope proteins. This study indicates that the sCD4-to-CD4 lymphocyte ratio increases linearly with disease severity and may be a useful marker of CD4 lymphocyte damage. In addition, serum sCD4 can bind viral particles, which may have implications for the use of recombinant sCD4 as a therapy in HIV infection."
2978,0.001,1.0000,"Our goal was to determine if paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity relates to the presence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and inflammation in HIV patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a prospective, multicenter study including 269 patients receiving HAART for at least 1 year and a maximum of 4 years. PON1 and inflammatory markers [C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A (SAA), and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors 2 (sTNF-R2)] were compared between patients with or without MS and the association between inflammatory markers and PON1 was assessed by logistic regression analyses. MS was found in 18.2% of the patients. Inflammatory markers, with the exception of sTNF-R2, were significantly higher, while PON1 activity was significantly lower in the presence of metabolic syndrome. PON1 activity was significantly related to apolipoprotein C3, CD4 count, and sTNF-R2. It may be concluded that PON1 appears to be a marker for the metabolic syndrome in HIV-infected subjects. PON1 activity is related to dyslipidemia and the immunological status of the patients but is not fully determined by inflammation."
7535,0.001,1.0000,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected patients. It is believed that HCV is a non-cytopathic virus and that T-cell-mediated events (including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) have an important role in promoting both liver damage and viral clearance. Whether HIV coinfection or antiretroviral therapies influence such events is still unclear. In the current study, we compared the expression of NKp46 (a natural killer cell marker), CD3 (a T-cell marker), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; pro-inflammatory cytokines) and interleukin-10 (IL-10; an anti-inflammatory cytokine) mRNA in the liver of naive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (group one, n=14), coinfected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (group two, n=23) and naive HCV mono-infected patients (group three, n=24). All three groups had comparable HCV viremia, with coinfected patients showing similar and relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts and significantly different HIV vireamia. Interestingly, when compared to groups two and three, group one showed significantly higher intrahepatic mRNA levels for CD3, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas the expression of NKp46 and IL-10 were comparable in all three groups. Further, higher histopathological grading scores within each group were independently associated with higher mRNA contents for CD3 and IFN-gamma and higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels at the time of liver biopsy. Together, these results suggest that HIV infection may exacerbate the immune-mediated inflammatory response in the liver of patients chronically infected with HCV and antiretroviral therapy may prevent this effect."
72,0.001,1.0000,"Serum levels of interleukin-7 (IL-7), a non-redundant cytokine that plays a crucial role in lymphopoiesis, are known to be elevated in HIV-1-infected subjects. To examine further the association between levels of IL-7, CD4+ cell counts and viraemia, we analysed these parameters in a large cohort of HIV-1 patients along with serum levels of 90K, a marker of disease severity but with no established involvement in lymphopoiesis. While IL-7 levels were only found to correlate with CD4+ cell counts, 90K levels presented strong correlations with both CD4+ cell numbers and with plasma viral loads (VLs). These correlations were maintained in patients naive to treatment with antiretrovirals (n = 38) but were abolished when the analysis was restricted to the group receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART, n = 82). Moreover, although 90K levels were significantly reduced in patients on HAART, IL-7 levels continued to be elevated despite successful treatment. The influence of HAART on the variations in these serum parameters was further assessed in a longitudinal study on 32 subjects. The HAART-induced decrease in VLs and increase in CD4+ counts were found to correlate with a reduced serum level of 90K and IL-7, respectively. Nevertheless, following a median period of 33 months of immunological and virological successful HAART, serum levels of IL-7 continued to be significantly elevated compared with those detected in healthy controls. These findings suggest that immunotherapy with IL-7, aimed to replenish T-cell stock in HAART-treated subjects, may have a limited impact on the process of immune reconstitution."
4439,0.001,1.0000,"Interleukin (IL)-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in both innate and adaptive immune responses against viruses and intracellular pathogens. Increased levels of circulating IL-18 from HIV-1 infected patients have been reported especially in the advanced and late stages of the disease, whereas in the initial stage serum levels of IL-18 were not increased. In contrast, low production of Il-18 was observed in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HIV-1 infected patients, and these results were also observed in macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In addition, decreased IL-18 production from PBMC was significantly correlated with low production of IL-2. Furthermore, serum levels of IL-18 significantly decreased after highly active antiretroviral therapy. During the early stage of HIV-1 infection there is a decreased production of gamma interferon (IFN), IL-12 and IL-2 as well as not activation of IL-18 production and this leads to inhibition of Th1 immune response, whereas in the advanced stage of the disease, strong activation of IL-18 production along with persistent decreased production of gamma IFN, IL-12 and IL-2 may promote a Th2 immune response, which leads to persistent viral replication. Several studies have shown increased levels of IL-18 in HIV-seronegative subjects with obesity, insulin resistance and type II diabetes. Metabolic disorders, fat redistribution and cardiovascular manifestations are becoming more frequent in HIV-1 infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs. Consequently, involvement of IL-18 in these disorders has been postulated and demonstrated in patients with lipodistrophy, or with hypertriglyceridemia. Finally, higher serum levels of IL-18 may represent an useful marker in HIV-1 infected patients with metabolic disorders and fat redistribution, as well as a sensitive predictor of cardiovascular complications in treated patients."
1807,0.001,1.0000,"The use of exogenous cytokines is part of translational immune-antiretroviral approaches to induce immune reconstitution and possibly eliminate the persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in virally suppressed infected individuals on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Recently, our laboratories demonstrated that interleukin-7 (IL-7) has significant efficiency in stimulating HIV-1 replication from proviral latency in CD4+ T lymphocytes of infected patients. The authors now investigated the possible role of IL-7 in HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD). The authors demonstrated that the IL-7 receptor is expressed on both human neurons (i.e., differentiated NT2 cells) and human astrocytes, with relatively higher mRNA levels in neurons. The translational protein levels of IL-7 receptor alpha were not proportional to those of the mRNA levels in these central nervous system (CNS)-based cell types. Exogenous IL-7 was observed to only slightly down-regulate IL-7 receptor alpha expression on both neurons and astrocytes, as assayed by Western blotting. Instead of promoting survival, surprisingly, exogenous IL-7 induced neuronal apoptosis, as detected by TUNEL assays. Furthermore, IL-7 augmented neuronal apoptosis induced by HIV-1 gp120. Human apoptosis genomic microarray analyses of IL-7-treated human neurons showed up-regulated expression of proapoptotic genes: protein kinases, caspase-10, FAST kinase, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, and BCL2-antagonist of cell death. These data suggest that IL-7 leads to neuronal apoptosis by a molecular mechanism(s) that occurs via Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death. These studies may therefore not only be key in evaluating the potential use of IL-7 in vivo as a therapeutic modality, but also suggest that IL-7, which is increased endogenously in HIV-1-infected individuals late in disease, may be involved in the neuronal apoptosis demonstrated during HAD."

We examined whether the addition of community-based accompaniment (characterized by daily home visits from a community health worker, directly observed treatment, nutritional support, transportation stipends, and other support as needed) to the Rwanda national model for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery would improve retention in care, viral load suppression, and change in CD4 count, relative to the national model alone."
3632,0.001,1.0000,"We studied the distribution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in CCR5-positive and -negative peripheral blood lymphocyte populations in HIV-1-infected individuals. While HIV-1 DNA in the CCR5-positive population showed no correlation with CD4 count, the increase of total HIV-1 DNA with lower CD4 count was mainly contributed by the increase of HIV-1 DNA in the CCR5-negative population. This might indicate the change in coreceptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 in later stages of disease progression. However, some of the samples with a high viral DNA load in the CCR5-negative population did not have any characteristic of the V3 loop sequence that is compatible with CXCR4 usage or the syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype. We also did not find any known characteristic change predictive of the SI phenotype in V1 and V2 sequences. Our findings showed that there might be a shift in target cell populations during disease progression, and this shift was not necessarily associated with the genetic changes characteristic of CXCR4 usage."
4936,0.001,1.0000,"The roles of nucleoside analogues and protease inhibitors (PIs) in the development of metabolic complications and fat-distribution abnormalities associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are not well known. We performed an observational study in which efavirenz was substituted for a PI for 41 patients receiving HAART who had prolonged virus suppression, clinical signs of severe lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. Clinical follow-up was performed for 1 year. Virus suppression was maintained in most of the patients, and a significant increase in CD4(+) lymphocyte count was observed, but no change in lipid profile or insulin resistance was observed. Abdominal fat content did not change, and subcutaneous fat depletion was even more pronounced >1 year after the switch. We conclude that, for PI-treated patients who present with lipoatrophy, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance, substituting efavirenz for PIs can maintain virus suppression and immunologic response to HAART, but it does not improve the lipid profile or resolve insulin resistance or lipoatrophy."

A prospective, randomised-controlled, 24-week trial of valacyclovir 1000 mg was performed. Mean CD4+ T-lymphocyte count at 24 weeks compared to baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was the primary outcome. HIV viral load suppression, HSV-2 outbreaks and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding were secondary outcomes. Participants were randomised to valacyclovir (N = 66) or placebo (N = 35). Study completion was 64%. There was no change in 24 weeks compared to baseline CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in either group (valacyclovir p = 0.91, placebo p = 0.59) or the proportion with HIV viral load suppression (valacyclovir p = 0.75, placebo p = 1.0). Genital HSV and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding were rare. Valacyclovir had no effect on CD4+ T-lymphocyte count or HIV viral load in this population. Valacyclovir may reduce clinical outbreaks and asymptomatic HSV-2 shedding, but the rarity of these events, along with its lack of benefit on HIV, does not support its use in this clinical setting. "

Plasma viral load decreased from 21,665 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL at baseline (month 0) to <20 copies/mL after 1 month of therapy with stavudine plus didanosine, and remained below 20 copies/mL until month 12, but always >5 copies/mL. Viral load in tonsilar tissue at month 12 was 125,000 copies/mg of tissue. After the change to triple-drug therapy, the plasma viral load decreased to 5 copies/mL, the CD4+ T cell count increased to 705 x 10(6)/L, and the viral load in tonsilar tissue decreased to <40 copies/mg of tissue at month 24.

Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1 seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+ percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988. In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 500 cells/mm3 was not associated with the secular time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.13).

Subcutaneous IL-2 was prescribed thrice weekly (at a dose of 3 x 10(6) IU) for 24 weeks and the patients were followed-up for 32 weeks.

HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients naive of anti-HCV therapy for whom a liver biopsy was performed between 1996 and 2003 were retrospectively studied in three University hospitals in Paris and the Parisian region. One hundred and fifty two patients (131 men and 21 women; mean age 39.3+/-4.9 years) were studied. Most of them (62%) were treated with HAART. HCV genotypes included type 1 (N=78), type 2 (N=1), type 3 (N=38) and type 4 (N=35). Mean duration of HCV infection was 19.0+/-5.2 years. Sixty-six percent had minimal to moderate fibrosis (F0/F1/F2) and 34% severe fibrosis (F3/F4).

7544,0.001,1.0000,"Aberrant expression of regulatory receptors programmed death-1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is linked with dysregulation and exhaustion of T lymphocytes during chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection; however, less is known about whether a similar process impacts B-lymphocyte function during HIV-1 infection. We reasoned that disruption of the peripheral B cell compartment might be associated with decreased neutralizing antibody activity. Expression of markers that indicate dysregulation (BTLA and PD-1), immune activation (CD95), and proliferation (Ki-67) was evaluated in B cells from HIV-1-infected viremic and aviremic subjects and healthy subjects, in conjunction with immunoglobulin production and CD4 T cell count. Viral load and cross-clade neutralizing activity in plasma from viremic subjects were also assessed. Dysregulation of B lymphocytes was indicated by a marked disruption of peripheral B cell subsets, increased levels of PD-1 expression, and decreased levels of BTLA expression in viremic subjects compared to aviremic subjects and healthy controls. PD-1 and BTLA were correlated in a divergent fashion with immune activation, CD4 T cell count, and the total plasma IgG level, a functional correlate of B cell dysfunction. Within viremic subjects, the total IgG level correlated directly with cross-clade neutralizing activity in plasma. The findings demonstrate that even in chronically infected subjects in which B lymphocytes display multiple indications of dysfunction, antibodies that mediate cross-clade neutralization breadth continue to circulate in plasma."

Twenty-five patients with chronic HIV infection were evaluated during three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy (8 weeks on/4 weeks off) in comparison with 20 healthy sex- and age-matched controls. At enrolment, HIV-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-16 and RANTES, and significantly lower concentrations of MCP-1, than did healthy controls. Levels of MIP-1beta were similar in both groups. Only the serum levels of IL-16 increased significantly in HIV-infected patients after every treatment interruption. However, differences between the CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell counts/microL, HIV loads and serum concentrations of each cytokine at baseline and at the end of the three cycles of intermittent interruptions of therapy were not significant. It was concluded that structured intermittent interruption of HAART for patients with chronic HIV infection did not modify the immunological parameters, including serum levels of CD8+ T-cell-derived inhibitory molecules, or the virus parameters studied. Thus, the findings do not support the use of this treatment modality for the management of HIV-infected patients."
5197,0.001,1.0000,"Six patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and demonstrable serum antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and two additional patients with HD belonging to HIV-associated high-risk groups but with negative HIV serology were studied. All patients were men and ranged in age from 21 to 45 years. The HIV risk factors included homosexuality (6), intravenous drug abuse (2), and hemophilia A (1). All patients had high pathologically determined stage (one Stage III and seven Stage IV), and bone marrow involvement was observed in five patients with the initial diagnosis of HD based on marrow biopsy in two cases. Four cases were histologically subclassified as mixed cellularity (MC) and three as nodular sclerosis (NS); one patient underwent only bone marrow biopsy and was not subclassified. Histologically all cases were characterized by numerous Reed-Sternberg cells and variants, and with the exception of one case, all had a distinctive decrease in the proportion of reactive background lymphocytes compared with what is usually expected in MC or NS Hodgkin's disease (relative lymphocyte depletion). Flow-cytometric immunophenotypic studies done on cell suspensions from diagnostic lymph node biopsies in four cases showed decreased CD4:CD8 ratios (mean = 1.4) compared with expected values of 4 to 6. The relative lymphocyte depletion observed histologically is probably a reflection of the decreased tissue CD4:CD8 ratios, and this impairment of host immune response may be related to the observed high stage in all eight cases. Patients with high stage HD and the described histologic and immunologic features should be evaluated for the presence of HIV infection."
6789,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patient isolates and molecular clones were used to analyze the determinants responsible for human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice. Non-syncytium-inducing, R5 or R3R5 HIV-1 isolates from asymptomatic infected people showed little or no human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice, while syncytium-inducing (SI), R5X4 or R3R5X4 HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals, isolated just prior to the onset of AIDS, rapidly and efficiently eliminated CD4-bearing human thymocytes. We have mapped the ability of one SI HIV-1 isolate to eliminate CD4(+) human cells in SCID-hu mice to a region of the env gene including the three most amino-terminal variable regions (V1 to V3). We find that for all of the HIV-1 isolates that we studied, a nonlinear relationship exists between viral replication and the depletion of CD4(+) cells. This relationship can best be described mathematically with a Hill-type plot indicating that a threshold level of viral replication, at which cytopathic effects begin to be seen, exists for HIV-1 infection of thymus/liver grafts in SCID-hu mice. This threshold level is 1 copy of viral DNA for every 11 cells (95% confidence interval = 1 copy of HIV-1 per 67 cells to 1 copy per 4 cells). Furthermore, while SI viruses more frequently achieve this level of replication, replication above this threshold level correlates best with cytopathic effects in this model system. We used GHOST cells to map the coreceptor specificity and relative entry efficiency of these early- and late-stage patient isolates of HIV-1. Our studies show that coreceptor specificity and entry efficiency are critical determinants of HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo."
2021,0.001,1.0000,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."
4872,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), like HIV-1, causes AIDS and is associated with AIDS cases primarily in West Africa. HIV-1 and HIV-2 display significant differences in nucleic acid sequence and in the natural history of clinical disease. Consistent with these differences, we have previously demonstrated that the enhancer/promoter region of HIV-2 functions quite differently from that of HIV-1. Whereas activation of the HIV-1 enhancer following T-cell stimulation is mediated largely through binding of the transcription factor NF-kappa B to two adjacent kappa B sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, activation of the HIV-2 enhancer in monocytes and T cells is dependent on four cis-acting elements: a single kappa B site, two purine-rich binding sites, PuB1 and PuB2, and a pets site. We have now identified a novel cis-acting element within the HIV-2 enhancer, immediately upstream of the kappa B site, designated peri-kappa B. This site is conserved among isolates of HIV-2 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus, and transfection assays show this site to mediate HIV-2 enhancer activation following stimulation of monocytic but not T-cell lines. This is the first description of an HIV-2 enhancer element which displays such monocyte specificity, and no comparable enhancer element has been clearly defined for HIV-1. While a nuclear factor(s) from both peripheral blood monocytes and T cells binds the peri-kappa B site, electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that either a different protein binds to this site in monocytes versus T cells or that the protein recognizing this enhancer element undergoes differential modification in monocytes and T cells, thus supporting the transfection data. Further, while specific constitutive binding to the peri-kappa B site is seen in monocytes, stimulation with phorbol esters induces additional, specific binding. Understanding the monocyte-specific function of the peri-kappa B factor may ultimately provide insight into the different role monocytes and T cells play in HIV pathogenesis."
2200,0.001,1.0000,"Progression of HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with frontal/subcortical dysfunction and mean reaction time (RT) slowing. Beyond group means, within-subject variability of RT has been found to be particularly sensitive to frontal/subcortical dysfunction in other populations. However, the possible relevance of RT variability to HIV/AIDS patients remains unknown. This study evaluated the relationships between RT variability and indicators such as neurocognitive, behavioral, and immunological status. A total of 46 HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral medication regimens were included in this study. Overall performance of this sample was poorer than normative means on measures of RT latency, RT variability, and traditional neurocognitive domains. Results demonstrated that the measures of RT variability were associated with global cognition, medication adherence rates, and peak immunological dysfunction, above and beyond the effects of RT latency. These preliminary findings suggest that measures of RT variability may provide enhanced sensitivity to neurocognitive disease burden in HIV/AIDS relative to more traditional measures of mean RT or cognitive function."
9754,0.001,1.0000,"CD4+ Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are potent immune modulators and serve an important function in human immune homeostasis. Depletion of Tregs has led to measurable increases in antigen-specific T cell responses in vaccine settings for cancer and infectious pathogens. However, their role in HIV-1 immuno-pathogenesis remains controversial, as they could either serve to suppress deleterious HIV-1-associated immune activation and thus slow HIV-1 disease progression or alternatively suppress HIV-1-specific immunity and thereby promote virus spread. Understanding and modulating Treg function in the context of HIV-1 could lead to potential new strategies for immunotherapy or HIV vaccines. However, important open questions remain on their role in the context of HIV-1 infection, which needs to be carefully studied. Representing roughly 5% of human CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood, studying the Treg population has proven to be difficult, especially in HIV-1 infected individuals where HIV-1-associated CD4 T cell and with that Treg depletion occurs. The characterization of regulatory T cells in individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease or tissue samples, for which only very small biological samples can be obtained, is therefore extremely challenging. We propose a technical solution to overcome these limitations using isolation and expansion of Tregs from HIV-1-positive individuals. Here we describe an easy and robust method to successfully expand Tregs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals in vitro. Flow-sorted CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Tregs were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads and cultured in the presence of IL-2. The expanded Tregs expressed high levels of FOXP3, CTLA4 and HELIOS compared to conventional T cells and were shown to be highly suppressive. Easier access to large numbers of Tregs will allow researchers to address important questions concerning their role in HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. We believe answering these questions may provide useful insight for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine."
9836,0.001,1.0000,"Pharmaceutical management of HIV infection is complex, and proper adherence to antiretroviral regimens is contingent on active patient involvement in treatment. We examined the relationship between patient understanding of HIV and its treatment and health literacy. Structured interviews were conducted with 157 HIV-infected individuals receiving care at a community-based clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. In all, 48% of patients were reading below a 9th grade level. One-third of patients could not name their HIV medications and this was significantly related to low literacy (P < 0.01). Two-thirds of those reading below the 9th grade level did not know how to take their medications correctly (P < 0.05), and 75% did not know the meaning of a CD4 count or viral load (P < 0.001). Patients with low literacy skills were more likely to state that their physician was their sole source of HIV information (P < 0.005). Physicians may require training to appropriately convey health information to patients of low literacy."
8653,0.001,1.0000,"The evaluation of new cases of HIV infection is relatively common in Spain, where several thousands of patients with new infections are diagnosed each year. Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life."
6681,0.001,1.0000,"It is still controversial whether viral hepatitis co-infection can influence antiretroviral plasma drug concentrations and whether drug concentrations are correlated with liver enzyme elevations during highly active antiretroviral therapy. An analysis of data from a cohort of 220 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients was conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were performed to identify predictors of plasma drug concentrations. The association of transaminase elevation with higher plasma drug concentrations was explored following stratification of patients into HIV monoinfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected groups. Hepatitis co-infections were independently correlated with drug concentrations above the therapeutic cut-offs at Week 1 (P=0.06), Week 4 (P=0.04) and Week 12 (P=0.005). The apparent effect was independent of the possible impact exerted by other variables such as demographics and medication adherence. The incidence of relevant hypertransaminasaemia was low. Patients with hepatitis co-infections had higher rates of transaminase elevation than monoinfected HIV patients; however, risk of transaminase elevation was not associated with drug concentrations. The presence of HCV and/or HBV co-infections correlated with higher plasma drug concentrations, although it did not appear to influence hepatotoxicity risk."
3809,0.001,1.0000,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."
4023,0.001,1.0000,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

7890,0.001,1.0000,"Certain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates are able to productively infect nondividing cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. We have used a molecular genetic approach to construct two different HIV-1 integrase mutants that were studied in the context of an infectious, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 molecular clone. One mutant, HIV-1 delta D(35)E, containing a 37-residue deletion within the central, catalytic domain of integrase, was noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. The HIV-1 delta D(35)E mutant, however, exhibited defects in the assembly and/or release of progeny virions in transient transfection assays, as well as defects in entry and/or viral DNA synthesis during the early stages of monocyte-derived macrophage infection. The second mutant, HIV-1D116N/8, containing a single Asp-to-Asn substitution at the invariant Asp-116 residue of integrase, was also noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages but, in contrast to HIV-1 delta D(35)E, was indistinguishable from wild-type virus in reverse transcriptase production. PCR analysis indicated that HIV-1D116N/8 entered monocyte-derived macrophages efficiently and reverse transcribed its RNA but was unable to complete its replication cycle because of a presumed block to integration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that integration is an obligate step in productive HIV-1 infection of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary human macrophage cultures."

HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
4193,0.001,1.0000,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."

4948,0.001,1.0000,"This paper assesses the extent of the financial burden due to out-of-pocket payments for health care incurred by people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the effect of this burden on their financial capacity. Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 353 PLHIV from three cities in Indonesia (Jakarta, Jogjakarta and Merauke). Respondents in Jakarta were sampled from one hospital and one non-governmental organization working with PLHIV. In Jogjakarta and Merauke, all HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) who came to selected hospitals during the interview period were asked to participate in the survey. The survey collected data on the frequency and extent of payments for HIV-related care, with answers cross-checked against medical records. Results show that PLHIV had different burdens of payments in the different geographical areas. On average, respondents in Jogjakarta spent 68%, and PLHIV on ART in Jakarta spent 96%, of monthly expenditure for HIV-related care, indicating a substantial financial burden for many ART patients. These patients depended on several sources of finance to cover the costs of their care, with donations from their immediate family being the most common method, selling assets and payments from personal income being the second most common method in Jakarta and Jogjakarta, respectively. Most PLHIV in these two areas did not have insurance. In Merauke, there were little observed out-of-pocket payments because the government covers medical costs via the local budget and health insurance for the poor. The results of this study confirm previous findings that providing subsidized ART drugs alone does not ensure financial accessibility to HIV care. Thus, the government of Indonesia at central and local levels should consider covering HIV care additional to providing antiretroviral drugs free of charge. Social health insurance should also be encouraged."
197,0.001,1.0000,"Clarifying the relationship between illicit drug use and HIV-1 virologic suppression requires characterization of both illicit drug use activity and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed a rapid clinical questionnaire to assess prior 7-day illicit drug use and ART adherence in a cross-sectional study among 1777 HIV-infected persons in care. Of these, 76% were male, 35% were African-American, and 8% reported injection drug use as their probable route of HIV-1 infection. Questionnaire-reported frequencies of cocaine and marijuana use within the previous 7 days were 3.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Over three quarters (77.8%) of participants were on ART, of whom 69.7% had HIV-1 virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA<48 copies/mL). Univariate analyses revealed that compared to no use, cocaine and marijuana use were both associated with missed ART doses (P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for nonadherence demonstrated that cocaine use was independently associated with failing to achieve virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.22-0.98) but marijuana use was not (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.72-1.62). This result strengthens the evidence of a direct effect of cocaine on virologic control, independent of nonadherence to ART."

A total of 62 patients, who abandoned therapy in 2008, and 188 HIV-infected patients answered an interview including demographic, social, and clinical characteristics. Risk factors associated with abandon in univariate analysis were entered into logistic regression models. A total of 250 patients were included in the study. Groups were similar regarding age, gender, and monthly income. In the final multivariate model, illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-5.07), previous abandon of medication (AOR 38.6; 95% CI 10.49-142.25), last CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) (AOR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.10), and viral load higher than 1000 copies/mL (AOR 2.0 (95% CI 1.34-3.09) were independent predictors of abandonment of ART.

These patients tend to have a faster progression of hepatic fibrosis. This cross-sectional study describes the demographic features and clinical profile of human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis co-infected patients in Paraná, Southern Brazil. A total of 93 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients attending a tertiary care academic hospital in Southern Brazil were included. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data were evaluated. Hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus positive serology was found in 6.6% of patients. The anti-hepatitis C virus serum test was positive in 85% (79/93) of patients, and the infection was confirmed in 72% of the cases. Eighteen patients (19%) were human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus positive (detectable HBsAg). Among co-infected patients, there was a high frequency of drug use, and investigations for the detection of co-infection were conducted late. A low number of patients were eligible for treatment and, although the response to antiretroviral therapy was good, there was a very poor response to hepatitis therapy. Our preliminary findings indicate the need for protocols aimed at systematic investigation of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, thus allowing for early detection and treatment of co-infected patients.

4011,0.001,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
1564,0.001,1.0000,"T cell functional plasticity helps tailor antiviral immunity during different phases of infections. We tested whether, during different phases of HBV infection, virus-specific T cells can acquire specific proinflammatory functions that could drive granulocyte/mononuclear cell liver infiltration. Multifunctional analysis of HBV-specific T cells during acute and chronic HBV infection revealed that HBV-specific T cells had the capacity to produce the neutrophil chemokine CXCL-8 but not IL-17. CXCL-8 producing T cells were detectable in the liver of chronic HBV patients with active hepatitis; while in acute HBV patients CXCL-8 production by T cells was temporally limited to the acute phase of disease, concomitant with the peak of liver inflammation. Characterization of the conditions necessary for the development of CXCL-8 producing T cells showed a requirement for IL-7 and IL-15 during T cell expansion. These data show that functional plasticity of virus-specific T cells spontaneously occurs during HBV infection and that an environment rich IL-7 and IL-15 can license T cells with the ability to produce CXCL-8 and potentially influence liver pathology."
6631,0.001,1.0000,"The cytokine pattern secreted by T cells on viral antigen recognition is believed to exert a profound influence on both the type of disease caused by the infecting agent and the final outcome of the viral infection. To characterize the cytokine pattern associated with spontaneous resolution of acute hepatitis B, we analyzed interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5 production by a wide series of hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleocapsid-specific T-cell lines (34 lines) and T-cell clones (71 clones) derived from the peripheral blood of 13 patients during the acute or recovery phase of hepatitis B (2 and 7 of them were studied only in the recovery or the acute phase, respectively, and 4 during both). Most T-cell lines (67%) and clones (77%) isolated during the acute phase of infection expressed a T-helper (Th) 1 cytokine profile dominated by the production of IFN-gamma. A larger proportion (74%) of T-cell lines produced several years after resolution of hepatitis was able to secrete not only IFN-gamma, but also IL-4 and IL-5 (Th0-like cells). Results indicate that the antigen-specific fraction of peripheral blood T cells in acute self-limited hepatitis B selectively secrete Th1-type eytokines, suggesting that Th1-mediated effects may contribute not only to liver cell injury, but probably also to recovery from disease and successful control of infection."
9875,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatocytes, the cells responsible for the metabolic and detoxification processes in the liver, are the predominant target of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, a major cause of liver cancer. The limited availability of normal human hepatocytes for cell-culture based studies is a significant challenge in HBV-associated liver cancer research. Therefore, there is a need for miniaturized cell-culture systems that can serve as a platform for studying the effect of HBV infections on hepatocyte physiology. Here, we present a microfluidic platform that can be used to study HBV replication in both rat and human hepatocytes. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels fabricated using soft lithography techniques served as a culture vessel for both primary rat hepatocytes (PRH) and a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. The micro cell-culture chamber was then used as a model for HBV replication studies. Cells were grown in static culture conditions and either transfected with an HBV-genome cDNA or infected with the viral genome expressed from a recombinant adenovirus. Supernatants collected from the microchannels were assayed for secreted HBV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We achieved approximately 40 and 10% transfection efficiencies in HepG2 cells and PRH respectively, and 80-100% adenoviral infection efficiency in PRH comparable to standard tissue culture methods. Moreover, we successfully detected replicated HBV using our novel platform. This platform can be easily extended to studies involving DNA transfection or HBV infection of primary human hepatocytes since only a small number of cells are required for studies in microfluidic chambers."
6338,0.001,1.0000,"To explore the mechanisms underlying liver-directed autoimmune reactions in acute Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, we followed five subjects who were identified in the early incubation phase (30-70 days before the first elevation of transaminases). We assessed serially cellular (using a T-lymphocyte migration inhibitory factor assay) and humoral (RIA) immunity to LSP (a macromolecular, liver-derived lipoprotein complex) and hepatic lectin (HL), the liver-specific receptor for desialylated glycoproteins, which appears to be a major target antigen for autoreactions in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Anti-LSP and anti-HL autoantibodies were found, at some stage during acute HBV infection, in 4/5 subjects, whereas cellular immunity to the same antigens was detected in only two patients. Sustained production of anti-HL antibodies was noted only in patients showing cellular immunity to this antigen and was apparently secondary to liver damage, whereas anti-LSP antibodies were first detected at the onset of liver injury when there was no evidence of T-cell immunity to the same antigenic complex. One explanation for this apparent dichotomy between cellular and humoral responses to LSP is that a helper T-cell response to the major envelope component of HBV, HBsAg, which precedes by 10-20 days the development of anti-LSP antibodies, promotes a humoral reaction to autoantigens contained in the LSP preparation, coexpressed with HBsAg, on the surface of infected hepatocytes."
6639,0.001,1.0000,"Eleven subjects who presented with a clinical illness characteristic of primary HIV-1 infection were treated with 1 g zidovudine daily for a median period of 56 days (range, 28-111 days). Primary HIV-1 infection was confirmed in each subject by seroconversion and virus isolation. The acute phase of the illness resolved a median of 4 days (range, 3-14 days) from commencement of zidovudine. Six subjects reported symptoms that may have been side-effects of zidovudine, the most common being nausea in four subjects and headache in two. Treatment was discontinued in one subject who had persistent headache and nausea. Haemoglobin, haematocrit and erythrocyte counts decreased and mean corpuscular volume increased significantly during the treatment. None of the subjects developed anaemia and none required dose modification or blood transfusion as a result of haematological side-effects. There were no significant differences in the granulocyte count or the lymphocyte count during any week of treatment when compared with baseline levels. There were no significant differences in T-cell subset numbers of the subjects during treatment compared with a group of historical controls. HIV-1 was isolated from several subjects during and after termination of zidovudine treatment. The results of this investigation indicate that zidovudine is a safe drug to administer to people with primary HIV-1 infection. There was no clear evidence, however, of any clinical benefit in terms of resolution of the acute illness and no indication that the treatment would prevent development of persistent infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1766,0.001,1.0000,"Hypersensitivity adverse drug reactions are much more common among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in the general population. High rates of hypersensitivity reactions to clindamycin have been noted. To investigate the role of reactive metabolites in these reactions, the authors studied toxicity of clindamycin and sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and their metabolites in uninfected and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected MOLT3 cells. Infected and uninfected cells were incubated with clindamycin or sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine in increasing concentrations; reactive metabolites were generated by coincubation of cells and drug with murine microsomes and a microsomal activating system. Over a concentration range of 0 to 400 microM SMX-HA, there was a significant concentration-dependent increase in cell death in HIV-infected compared to uninfected cells (28%+/-3% vs 8%+/-5% at 400 microM, P < .05). In contrast, coincubation of cells with clindamycin, microsomes, and a microsomal activating system, as well as combinations of primaquine or pyrimethamine, was not associated with an increase in cell death among infected compared to uninfected cells. No concentration-toxicity was demonstrated. These data support the role of reactive metabolites in adverse drug reactions to sulfonamides during HIV infection, whereas alternate mechanism(s) may be responsible for increased rates of adverse drug reactions to clindamycin among patients with AIDS."
1748,0.001,1.0000,"A peptide designated DP-107 was synthesized containing amino acid residues 558-595 of the envelope glycoprotein gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1LAI). Algorithms for secondary structure have predicted that this region of the envelope transmembrane protein should form an extended alpha-helix. Consistent with this prediction, analysis by circular dichroism (CD) indicated that, under physiological conditions, DP-107 is approximately 85% helical. The high degree of stable secondary structure in a synthetic peptide of this size suggests self-association typical of a coiled coil or leucine zipper. In biological assays, the peptide efficiently blocked virus-mediated cell-cell fusion processes as well as infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by both prototypic and primary isolates of HIV-1. A single amino acid substitution in the peptide greatly destabilized its solution structure as measured by CD and abrogated its antiviral activity. An analogue containing a terminal cysteine was oxidized to form a dimer, and this modification lowered the dose required for antiviral effect from 5 to about 1 microgram/ml. These results suggest that both oligomerization and ordered structure are necessary for biological activity. They provide insights also into the role of this region in HIV infection and the potential for development of a new class of antiviral agents."
6600,0.001,1.0000,"The mutations in the CCR5 coding region, such as CCR5Delta32 and CCR5m303, that suppress the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 do not exist in Chinese people. However, 9 Chinese subjects in Taiwan with histories of multiple sexual exposures to HIV remained uninfected, suggesting that certain anti-HIV factors do indeed exist. Experiments were therefore designed to investigate the immune mechanism that protects this cohort against HIV infection. Peripheral blood samples from these 9 subjects and 7 healthy people who had not been exposed to HIV were obtained for the quantitation of the levels for beta-chemokines and interleukin 16 (IL-16) in serum samples or secreted by peripheral blood lymphocytes. Significantly higher serum levels for nearly all 3 beta-chemokines, regulation on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta (P<.05, P<.05, and P=.05, respectively), but not IL-16, were detected in the 9 HIV-uninfected subjects as compared with control subjects. The result suggests that among the host genes and cellular factors thus far identified, beta-chemokines are the major HIV-suppressive factors that protect Chinese people from infection with HIV."
5006,0.001,1.0000,"Different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vary markedly in the ability to infect cells of the monocyte/macrophage (M/M) lineage. M/M are generally resistant to infection with T-cell-tropic (T-tropic) strains of HIV-1. Recently, the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 were identified as cofactors for fusion/entry of macrophage- and T-tropic strains of HIV-1, respectively. To investigate the mechanisms of resistance of M/M to T-tropic HIV-1 infection, we examined a number of subclones of the U937 promonocytic cell line. We found that certain subclones of U937 (plus clones) could, while others (minus clones) could not, support replication of T-tropic strains of HIV-1. We demonstrate that (i) both minus and plus clones support HIV-1 replication when transfected with an infectious molecular cDNA clone of a T-tropic HIV-1; (ii) minus clones do not, but plus clones do, efficiently support fusion with cells expressing HIV-1 IIIB Env; (iii) both plus and minus clones (with the exception of one clone) express physiologically functional CXCR4 protein as well as CD4 on the cell surface; (iv) introduction of CXCR4 into the CXCR4-negative clone does not restore fusogenicity with or susceptibility to T-tropic HIV-1; and (v) a ligand (stromal cell-derived factor 1) for or a monoclonal antibody (12G5) to CXCR4 does not effectively inhibit HIV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion of U937 cells. These data indicate that resistance to T-tropic HIV-1 infection of U937 minus clones occurs at fusion/ entry events and that expression of functional CXCR4 and CD4 is not a sole determinant for susceptibility to T-tropic HIV-1 infection; furthermore, they suggest that other factors are positively or negatively involved in HIV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in U937 promonocytic cells."
6496,0.001,1.0000,"Increased expression of the multidrug efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) has been suggested as a potential mechanism for decreased drug availability at certain intracellular sites that provide sanctuary for HIV. Here we investigate the expression of these transporters in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers. Venous blood (30 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers (n = 21) and HIV-infected patients (n = 21; 4 antiretroviral drug naive, 17 antiretroviral drug experienced). PBMCs were isolated and fixed. To assess P-gp expression, PBMCs were incubated with an isotype control antibody or an antibody directed to an external epitope of P-gp (UIC2). To assess MRP expression, cells were permeabilized before incubation with either a control antibody or an antibody directed to an internal epitope of MRP (MRPm5). After washing, a secondary phycoerythrin-bound antibody was incubated. After additional wash steps, samples were fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. The median fluorescence intensity of 5000 events was recorded. Results are expressed as fold increase between isotype control and UIC2/MRPm5 samples. Expression of P-gp in HIV-infected patients (1.42 +/- 0.36) was significantly lower (p = 0.0021; 95% CI, -0.633 to -0.164) than in healthy volunteers (1.82 +/- 0.55). However, MRP expression was similar in HIV-infected patients (1.37 +/- 0.34) and healthy volunteers (1.37 +/- 0.21; p = 0.91; 95% CI, -0.148941 to 0.165191). We conclude that in HIV infection, P-gp expression in total PBMCs is reduced whereas MRP expression appears to be unaltered."
933,0.001,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) TAR element is critical for the activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein, Tat. Mutagenesis has demonstrated that a stable stem-loop RNA structure containing both loop and bulge structures transcribed from TAR is the major target for tat activation. Though transient assays have defined elements critical for TAR function, no studies have yet determined the role of TAR in viral replication because of the inability to generate viral stocks containing mutations in TAR. In the current study, we developed a strategy which enabled us to generate stable 293 cell lines which were capable of producing high titers of different viruses containing TAR mutations. Viruses generated from these cell lines were used to infect both T-lymphocyte cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Viruses containing TAR mutations in either the upper stem, the bulge, or the loop exhibited dramatically decreased HIV-1 gene expression and replication in all cell lines tested. However, we were able to isolate lymphoid cell lines which stably expressed gene products from each of these TAR mutant viruses. Though the amounts of virus in these cell lines were roughly equivalent, cells containing TAR mutant viruses were extremely defective for gene expression compared with cell lines containing wild-type virus. The magnitude of this decrease in viral gene expression was much greater than previously seen in transient expression assays using HIV-1 long terminal repeat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene constructs. In contrast to the defects in viral growth found in T-lymphocyte cell lines, several of the viruses containing TAR mutations were much less defective for gene expression and replication in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results indicate that maintenance of the TAR element is critical for viral gene expression and replication in all cell lines tested, though the cell type which is infected is also a major determinant of the replication properties of TAR mutant viruses."

However, most studies have investigated Vpr localization employing cell types irrelevant to HIV-1 pathogenesis. To gain a better understanding of how cellular phenotype might impact HIV-1 Vpr intracellular localization, Vpr localization was examined in several cell lines representing major cellular targets for HIV-1 infection within the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and central nervous system (CNS)."
7707,0.001,1.0000,"Abstract   Health care utilization for HIV-1-infected patients appears to be declining in the United States as a result of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART); yet the opposite appears true in the HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfected population. The reasons for this difference are not well understood. We examined the rates and reasons for emergency department visits and hospital admissions at an academic tertiary care medical center for HIV/HCV coinfected patients as compared to HIV-1 monoinfected patients, using a retrospective matched cohort study design. HIV/HCV coinfected patients had higher rates of health care utilization (emergency department visits 43.9 versus 7.1 per 100 person-years; hospital admissions 18.2 versus 6.7 per 100 person-years, for HIV coinfected and monoinfected, respectively). This increase was not solely due to liver related events. Instead, comorbidities such as diabetes, renal disease, and psychiatric/substance abuse played a larger role in the health-care utilization in the HIV/HCV coinfected population."
7954,0.001,1.0000,"CD8(+) T-cell responses are an essential antiviral host defense in persistent viral infections, and their sustained effectiveness is thought to be critically dependent on CD4(+) T-helper cells. To determine the relationship between HIV-1-induced CD4(+) T-cell depletion and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses during viral persistence, we studied 103 persons positive for HCV, 74 coinfected with HIV-1. CD8(+) T-cell responses to the entire HCV polyprotein were determined by using an interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Although HIV-1 infection by itself was not associated with a diminished HCV-specific response, HIV-1-associated CD4(+) depletion was associated with significantly lower HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells (R = 0.48, P < .0001). In contrast, declining CD4(+) counts over the same range were not associated with diminished Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- (R = 0.19, P = .31) or HIV-1-specific (R = -0.13, P = .60) CD8(+) T-cell responses in persons infected with all viruses. These data indicate that frequencies of circulating HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses are sensitive to absolute CD4(+) T-cell counts and provide a possible explanation for the accelerated HCV disease course in persons coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV."
8679,0.001,1.0000,"Recently, it was shown that peripheral blood FOXP3+CD4+ T cells are composed of three phenotypic and functionally distinct subpopulations. Two of them having in vitro suppressive effects were characterized as resting Treg cells (rTregs) and activated Treg cells (aTregs). A third subset, identified as FOXP3+ non-Tregs, does not display any suppressor activity and produce high levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines upon stimulation. In the present study we focus on the characteristics of these three subsets of FOXP3+CD4+ T cells in untreated HIV-1-infected patients. We found that the absolute counts of rTregs, aTregs and FOXP3+ non-Tregs were reduced in HIV-1 patients compared with healthy donors. The relative frequency of rTregs and aTregs was similar in HIV-1 patients and healthy donors, while the frequency of FOXP3+ non-Tregs was significantly higher in HIV-1 patients, reaching a maximum in those patients with the lower values of CD4 counts. Contrasting with the observations made in FOXP3- CD4+ T cells, we did not find a negative correlation between the number of rTregs, aTregs or FOXP3+ non-Tregs and virus load. Studies performed with either whole PBMCs or sorted aTregs and FOXP3+ non-Tregs cells showed that these two populations of FOXP3+ T cells were highly permissive to HIV-1 infection. Upon infection, FOXP3+ non-Tregs markedly down-regulates its capacity to produce Th1 and Th17 cytokines, however, they retain the ability to produce substantial amounts of Th2 cytokines. This suggests that FOXP3+ non-Tregs might contribute to the polarization of CD4+ T cells into a Th2 profile, predictive of a poor outcome of HIV-1-infected patients."
1606,0.001,1.0000,"High-level adherence to regimens of combination antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic medications for opportunistic infections (OIs) is crucial to their success. However, little is known about the association between adherence to these life-sustaining therapies and such clinical outcomes as progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or development of OIs. We assessed adherence to regimens of antiretroviral and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylactic medications in 643 patients enrolled in a trial of MAC prophylaxis. By week 56 of the study follow-up, 42% of the patients reported nonadherence to MAC prophylaxis, whereas one-quarter of the patients reported nonadherence to potent antiretroviral regimens. Nonadherence to both MAC prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy was associated with higher human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RNA levels and a significant increase in the risk of developing an AIDS-defining complication or death. Predictors of nonadherence are presented. These results underscore the clinical significance of adherence to HIV therapy and may be helpful in designing interventions to optimize the management of HIV by improving adherence."
6949,0.001,1.0000,"An immunocompetent, permissive, small-animal model would be valuable for the study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis and for the testing of drug and vaccine candidates. However, the development of such a model has been hampered by the inability of primary rodent cells to efficiently support several steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Although transgenesis of the HIV receptor complex and human cyclin T1 have been beneficial, additional late-phase blocks prevent robust replication of HIV-1 in rodents and limit the range of in vivo applications. In this study, we explored the HIV-1 susceptibility of rabbit primary T cells and macrophages. Envelope-specific and coreceptor-dependent entry of HIV-1 was achieved by expressing human CD4 and CCR5. A block of HIV-1 DNA synthesis, likely mediated by TRIM5, was overcome by limited changes to the HIV-1 gag gene. Unlike with mice and rats, primary cells from rabbits supported the functions of the regulatory viral proteins Tat and Rev, Gag processing, and the release of HIV-1 particles at levels comparable to those in human cells. While HIV-1 produced by rabbit T cells was highly infectious, a macrophage-specific infectivity defect became manifest by a complex pattern of mutations in the viral genome, only part of which were deamination dependent. These results demonstrate a considerable natural HIV-1 permissivity of the rabbit species and suggest that receptor complex transgenesis combined with modifications in gag and possibly vif of HIV-1 to evade species-specific restriction factors might render lagomorphs fully permissive to infection by this pathogenic human lentivirus."
5114,0.001,1.0000,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."
784,0.001,1.0000,"Heterosexual contact is the primary mode of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) transmission worldwide. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is the major coreceptor that is associated with the mucosal transmission of R5-tropic HIV-1 during sexual intercourse. The CCR5 molecule is thus a target for antibody-based therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking HIV-1 entry into cells. We have previously demonstrated that polyreactive natural antibodies (NAbs) from therapeutic preparations of immunoglobulin G and from human breast milk contain NAbs directed against CCR5. Such antibodies inhibit the infection of human macrophages and T lymphocytes by R5-tropic isolates of HIV in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that human immunoglobulins from the cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-seronegative or HIV-seropositive women contain NAbs directed against the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. Natural affinity-purified anti-CCR5 antibodies bound to CCR5 expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells and further inhibited the infection of macrophages and dendritic cells with primary and laboratory-adapted R5-tropic HIV but not with X4-tropic HIV. Natural anti-CCR5 antibodies moderately inhibited R5-tropic HIV transfer from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to autologous T cells. Our results suggest that mucosal anti-CCR5 antibodies from healthy immunocompetent donors may hamper the penetration of HIV and may be suitable for use in the development of novel passive immunotherapy regimens in specific clinical settings of HIV infection."
2952,0.001,1.0000,"Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected children. However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."

Data were analyzed to assess associations between study variables and whether participants returned for care following an initial mental health assessment. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which the addition of measures of health beliefs and HIV-related stigma would enhance the predictive capacity of a dropout model that included demographics and health status measures. As health beliefs and HIV-related stigma were added to the model, the predictive capacity increased significantly (R(2)=0.29 to R(2)=0.63, p<0.05). Those who did not return for care had higher levels of perceived barriers to mental health care, higher levels of HIV-related stigma, were more likely to be of non-white ethnicity and had lower T-cell counts. These findings indicate that mental health providers may need to ensure care systems are responsive to the social and cultural characteristics of clients, and the HIV epidemic itself, in order to effectively engage clients into care."
6193,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may either emerge in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as a result of positive selection pressure exerted by their own immune response, or during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Naturally occurring HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance are rarely observed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the (eventual) circulation of HBV variants with natural resistance to NAs currently used as therapy for CHB in Argentina. This study reports 13 cases of CHB-infected patients with natural antiviral resistance to at least one NA. Five of them were also carriers of S-variants that might escape the humoral immune system recognition with potential resistance to adefovir. In addition to the already reported A2 HBV subgenotype association to NAs natural resistance, E and F genotypes association to such resistance is described for the first time. These findings suggest that sequence analysis of the HBV reverse transcriptase might be an essential tool before starting antiviral therapy, in order to choose the proper NAs for optimizing the therapeutic management of chronically infected patients. Moreover, the circulation and transmission of S-mutants with resistance to such antiviral drugs should be of public health concern as they may represent an additional risk for the community."
1654,0.001,1.0000,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age, especially among women with HIV-1 infection. Several bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), lipoteichoic acids (LTA), and peptidoglycans (PGN) are stimulatory ligands for Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and recent evidence indicates the important role of variation in TLR genes for permitting overgrowth of gram negative and BV-type flora. We assessed whether genetic polymorphisms in five TLR genes (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9) could be determinants of differential host immune responses to BV in 159 HIV-1-positive African American adolescents enrolled in the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) study. BV was assessed biannually and diagnosed either by a Nugent score of at least 7 of 10, or using the Amsel criteria. Cox-proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for concurrent Chlamydia and Gonorrhea infections, douching, and absolute CD4 cell count, were used to identify host genetic factors associated with BV. Two SNPs were associated with BV as diagnosed by the Nugent score and the combined criteria: a minor allele G of rs4986790 (frequency=0.07), which encodes a His to Tyr substitution in TLR4 (HR=1.47, 95% CI 1.15-1.87) and rs187084 (frequency=0.24) on TLR9. The minor allele of rs1898830 (frequency=0.13) was associated with an increased hazard of BV defined by the Amsel criteria (HR=1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95).

Other inflammatory disorders may occur in HTLV-I-infected patients, such as sicca syndrome resembling Sjögren's syndrome. The sicca syndrome may be the unique clinical manifestation of HTLV-I infection, but is associated frequently with TSP/HAM, which could suggest that sicca syndrome might be an early event in disease progression to TSP/HAM in some cases. We investigated whether peculiar pX and LTR mutations could be related to sicca syndrome, or might argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM. pX, especially pX(I), pX(II), and pX(IV) ORFs corresponding to Tax cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes, and LTR regions from Caribbean patients who have sicca syndrome with or without TSP/HAM, ATL patients, and healthy carriers were sequenced. The sequences were aligned and compared with ATK-1 prototype and published sequences. LTR sequences exhibited 1.5-2.4% of divergence with ATK-1. pX-sequenced regions showed a lower homology within p12(I) encoding sequences. Only few mutations were found within functionally important regions, but were not associated specifically with the clinical status. Finally, no mutations that could be related to sicca syndrome or argue the existence of clinical progression to TSP/HAM were found. It would be of interest to study the clinical evolution of HTLV-I-sicca syndrome in patients and to determine HTLV-I sequences from peripheral blood and salivary glands at different stages."
8880,0.001,1.0000,"The long-term efficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy may relate to augmentation of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) CD8(+) T-cell responses. We found that prolonged treatment of late-stage HIV-1-infected patients with a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors failed to restore sustained, high levels of HIV-1-specific, HLA class I-restricted, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte precursors and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by CD8(+) T cells. In some patients, particularly those initiating three-drug combination therapy simultaneously rather than sequentially, there were early, transient increases in the frequency of anti-HIV-1 CD8(+) T cells that correlated with decreases in HIV-1 RNA and increases in T-cell counts. In the other patients, HIV-1-specific T-cell functions either failed to increase or declined from baseline during triple-drug therapy, even though some of these patients showed suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA. These effects of combination therapy were not unique to HIV-1 specific T-cell responses, since similar effects were noted for CD8(+) T cells specific for the cytomegalovirus pp65 matrix protein. The level and breadth of CD8(+) cell reactivity to HLA A*02 HIV-1 epitopes, as determined by IFN-gamma production and HLA tetramer staining after combination therapy, were related to the corresponding responses prior to treatment. There was, however, a stable, residual population of potentially immunocompetent HIV-1-specific T cells remaining after therapy, as shown by tetramer staining of CD8(+) CD45RO(+) cells. These results indicate that new strategies will be needed to target residual, immunocompetent HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to enhance the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
787,0.001,1.0000,"Concerns have been raised that universal availability of antiretroviral agents in resource-limited settings might lead to the emergence and spread of resistant strains. We present the largest survey on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance among treatment-naïve and experienced patients followed in small, relatively underprivileged cities in Brazil with universal availability to standard of care antiretroviral combinations. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2006 from 95 patients followed in the cities of Saquarema and Santo Antonio de Pádua, state of Rio de Janeiro. A proviral fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions was generated and drug susceptibility level was inferred. Among 50 strains from drug-naïve subjects, one (2%) had intermediate-level resistance to RT inhibitors. Among 38 patients on therapy as of sampling, 28 (73.7%) had plasma viral load (PVL) below detection limit (26 of whom without evidence of resistance mutations) and 11 (28.9%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility. Only two strains harbored both protease and RT inhibitor mutations. Among seven patients who were off-treatment as of sampling, two (28.5%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility to RT inhibitors. The relatively high frequency of undetectable PVL among patients on treatment and the overall low prevalence of resistance-associated mutations are reassuring. Continued surveillance, however, is necessary."
9597,0.001,1.0000,"The intestinal mucosa contains most of the total lymphocyte pool and plays an important role in viral transmission, but only slight attention has been given to the immunological and virological aspects of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection at this site. In this study, before initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy, paired blood samples and rectal biopsies (RB) were obtained from 26 consecutive HIV-infected subjects. HIV-1 isolation and biological characterization, DNA, and HIV-1 RNA titration were assessed, as were in vitro tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-beta (IL-1beta) spontaneous production. The rate of HIV-1 isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and RBs was 75% and 58%, respectively. All RB-derived isolates were nonsyncytium inducing (NSI), independent of the phenotype of blood-derived isolates. Proviral DNA and detectable HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in 100% and 77% of RBs, respectively. A statistical correlation was observed between HIV-1 DNA and HIV-1 RNA levels in rectal mucosa (P = 0.0075), whereas no correlation was found between these levels in blood samples (P > 0.05). Antiretroviral treatment did not seem to influence HIV-1 detection in RBs. Higher levels of in vitro proinflammmatory cytokine production were found in the RBs of most infected patients when compared with healthy controls. Therefore, the rectal mucosa is an important HIV-1 reservoir that demonstrates a discordant viral evolution with respect to blood. Both the virus type and the mucosa pathway of immunoactive substances might have important implications for therapeutic decision-making and monitoring and could influence the bidirectional transmission of HIV-1 in mucosal surfaces."
783,0.001,1.0000,"Worldwide, nearly two million children are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with breastfeeding accounting for the majority of contemporary HIV transmissions. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality but is not curative. The main barrier to a cure is persistence of latent HIV in long-lived reservoirs. However, our understanding of the cellular and anatomic sources of the HIV reservoir during infancy and childhood is limited. Here, we developed a pediatric model of ART suppression in orally simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaque (RM) infants, with measurement of virus persistence in blood and tissues after 6 to 9 months of ART. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to compare SIV RNA and DNA levels in adult and infant RMs naive to treatment and on ART. We demonstrate efficient viral suppression following ART initiation in SIV-infected RM infants with sustained undetectable plasma viral loads in the setting of heterogeneous penetration of ART into lymphoid and gastrointestinal tissues and low drug levels in the brain. We further show reduction in SIV RNA and DNA on ART in lymphoid tissues of both infant and adult RMs but stable (albeit low) levels of SIV RNA and DNA in the brains of viremic and ART-suppressed infants. Finally, we report a large contribution of naive CD4"
9489,0.001,1.0000,"Cellular immune responses to hepatitis B virus (HBV) play an important role in the resolution of acute infection. They also influence the course of chronic infection and disease but are inadequate to completely clear the infection. Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection of the woodchuck can provide a model to study these processes. Lymphocyte responses of woodchucks were assessed by in vitro proliferation and/or interleukin (IL)-2 assays using mitogen (Concanavalin A [ConA]), cytokine (IL-2), superantigen (Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B [SEB]), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allo-antigen (mixed lymphocyte reaction [MLR]), and viral antigens (woodchuck hepatitis virus core antigen [WHcAg] and woodchuck hepatitis virus surface antigen [WHsAg]). ConA-stimulated woodchuck lymphocytes underwent cell division based on cell counting experiments and produced IL-2 as detected using an IL-2-dependent murine cell line but failed to incorporate sufficient tritiated thymidine; however, they did incorporate sufficient tritiated adenosine and deoxyadenosine to permit development of a meaningful proliferation assay. The IL-2 assay was sensitive and specific for detection of woodchuck IL-2 induced by mitogen, superantigen, and MLR, as shown by quantitative titration analysis and anti-body neutralization of ConA-supernatant activity. Cyclosporin A and FK506 specifically inhibited ConA- and SEB-induced IL-2 production by woodchuck lymphocytes. Positive two-way MLRs were detected by IL-2 production and proliferation assay between woodchucks from different geographic regions, thus indicating divergence among MHC molecules; however, occasional negative MLR reactions among indigenous pairs of woodchucks indicated that some woodchucks were mutually immunocompatible to some degree. The radioadenosine proliferation assay was sensitive for detecting peripheral blood lymphocyte responses to WHcAg and WHsAg in adult woodchucks with recently resolved acute infections. The above systems should facilitate the design of adoptive therapy and liver transplantation experiments in the woodchuck, and also enable modeling of immune responses that promote and maintain chronic hepadnavirus infection."
531,0.001,1.0000,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
334,0.001,1.0000,"In spite of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, HBV infection remains an important public health problem worldwide. Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out."
4058,0.001,1.0000,"The prevalence of false-positive reactions for syphilis (reactive rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test and nonreactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test) among patients at sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics was assessed to evaluate the association between false-positive RPR reactions and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Among 2672 patients, 400 (15.0%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 254 (9.5%) had a reactive RPR test. Of the 254 reactive RPR tests, 231 (90.1%) were also positive by FTA-ABS, leaving 23 false-positive RPR reactions. After excluding the 231 patients with positive FTA-ABS tests, false-positive RPR tests were found in 9 (2.7%) of 330 anti-HCV-positive patients compared with 14 (0.6%) of 2154 anti-HCV-negative participants (relative risk, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-10.9; P = .0017). These data demonstrate that HCV infection is associated with false-positive RPR test results. However, because of the high prevalence of syphilis among STD patients, the RPR test remains a strong indicator of syphilis in this setting."
5465,0.001,1.0000,"Some individuals remain uninfected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), despite multiple sexual contacts with subjects with confirmed HIV-1 infection. Several studies have confirmed that individuals who are homozygous for a 32 base pair (bp) deletion mutation in the chemokine receptor gene CCR5, designated as delta 32/ delta 32, are protected against HIV-1 infection. Heterozygotes of the same chemokine receptor deletion mutation are, however, not protected from acquiring HIV-1 infection but seemingly have slower progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS). Genotype frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation vary markedly among different ethnic groups; heterozygosity is found in approximately 15% of Caucasians, about 5-7% of Hispanics and African Americans and 1% or less of Asians. The ethnic background of Puerto Ricans is highly complex and usually includes admixture of Caucasian, Caribbean Indian and African traits to a varying extent. This study was conducted to examine the frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation among Puerto Ricans who are infected with HIV-1. Samples were received from different geographical regions of the island. Of 377 samples tested, 94.2% were wild type (non-deletion mutant) homozygotes, 5.8% were delta 32 CCR5 heterozygotes, and none were delta 32 CCR5 homozygotes. The incidence of CCR5 delta 32/w heterozygous mutation among Puerto Ricans seems to be somewhat lower than what was reported with US Hispanics. Some age and gender associated bias of the mutation frequency were observed with the study population, the reason for which is unclear at present."
6899,0.001,1.0000,"The rare hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype G (HBV/G) coinfects HIV-1-positive individuals along with HBV/A and generates recombinants. However, the circulation of HBV A/G recombinants remains poorly understood. This molecular epidemiologic study examined HBV A/G recombinants in Japanese HIV-1-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Initially, blood specimens submitted for confirmatory tests of HIV infection in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan, from 2006 to 2013 were examined for HIV-1, and HIV-1-positive specimens were screened for HBV. Among 817 specimens from HIV-1-positive individuals, HBsAg was detected in 59 specimens; of these, HBV/Ae (alternatively A2), a subgenotype of HBV/A prevalent in Europe and North America, was identified in 70.2%, HBV/C in 17.5%, and HBV/G in 10.5%, and HBV/E in 1.8% according to the core gene sequence. The full-length genome analysis of HBV was performed on HBV/G-positive specimens because some HBV A/G recombinants were historically overlooked by genotyping based on a partial genome analysis. It revealed that five of the specimens contained novel Ae/G recombinants, the core gene of which had a high sequence similarity to HBV/G. Detailed analyses showed that novel recombinants were coinfected with HBV/Ae in a recombinant-dominant fashion. No major drug-resistant mutations were found in the newly identified HBV Ae/G recombinants. Some of the individuals asymptomatically coinfected with HIV/HBV suffered mild liver injury. This study demonstrated that novel Ae/G HBV recombinants were identified in Japanese HIV-1-positive MSM. The pathogenicity of novel HBV Ae/G recombinants should be examined in a future longitudinal study. Surveillance of such viruses in HIV-1-positive individuals should be emphasized. "
9325,0.001,1.0000,"The major group of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains that comprise the current global pandemic have diversified during their worldwide spread into at least 10 distinct subtypes, or clades. Subtype C predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for the majority of worldwide HIV-1 infections, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, and subtype E is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Significant amino acid variations have been observed among the clade-specific Tat proteins. For the present study, we examined clade-specific interactions between Tat, transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, and P-TEFb proteins and how these interactions may modulate the efficiency of HIV-1 transcription. Clade-specific Tat proteins significantly modified viral gene expression. Tat proteins derived from HIV-1 clades C and E were strong transactivators of long terminal repeat (LTR) activity; Tat E also had a longer half-life than the other Tat proteins and interacted more efficiently with the stem-loop TAR element. Chimeric Tat proteins harboring the Tat E activation domain were strong transactivators of LTR expression. While Tat B, C, and E were able to rescue a Tat-defective HIV-1 proviral clone, Tat E was significantly more efficient at rescue than Tat C, possibly due to the relative stability of the Tat protein. Swapping the activation domains of Tat B, C, and E identified the cyclin T1 association domain as a critical determinant of the transactivation efficiency and of Tat-defective HIV-1 provirus rescue."
1822,0.001,1.0000,"This cross-sectional study of 341 entrants to drug abuse treatment in four Connecticut cities in 1986-1987 evaluated whether demographic, behavioral, viral serologic, or economic differences explained the disproportionate risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among black and Hispanic intravenous drug users (IVDUs), relative to non-Hispanic white IVDUs. Blacks [odds ratio (OR) = 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.1-15.9] and Hispanics (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.9-8.8) were at increased risk of HIV-1 infection, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Those who lived closer to New York City, injected drugs more frequently, used intravenous drugs for a longer duration, used shooting galleries, had greater numbers of sexual partners, had human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies, and had the lowest annual incomes were also at increased risk. However, none of these other factors accounted for the black and Hispanic HIV-1 risk in stratified analysis. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, proximity to New York City, and number of drug injections in the past year each also remained significant, independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The increased HIV-1 risk of nonwhite IVDUs remained unexplained. Behavioral, sociologic, and/or biologic factors not identified in this study may modulate HIV-1 transmission dynamics in IVDUs."

8317,0.001,1.0000,"Humoral response to vaccination has been found to be inadequate in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We retrospectively assessed antibody responses to three routinely recommended vaccines, against hepatitis B, hepatitis A and S. pneumoniae, in HIV-infected individuals. Data regarding age at HIV diagnosis, years of infection, sex, nationality, HIV mode of transmission, CD4 cell count, nadir CD4 count, plasma viral load, HIV stage, insurance status, educational level and treatment with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed in order to detect factors associated with response to vaccination. 437 patients were assessed for hepatitis B, 627 patients for hepatitis A and 66 patients for S. pneumoniae serologic vaccine responsiveness. Regarding hepatitis B and hepatitis A, education level and insurance status were the only predictors of response. As for S. pneumoniae vaccination HAART and control of viremia were correlated with better response to vaccination."

Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."
838,0.001,1.0000,"We studied 1163 sexually-active HIV-infected South African men and women in an urban primary care program to understand patterns of sexual behaviors and whether these behaviors differed by partner HIV status. Overall, 40% reported a HIV-positive partner and 60% a HIV-negative or status unknown partner; and 17.5% reported >2 sex acts in the last 2 weeks, 16.4% unprotected sex in the last 6 months, and 3.7% >1 sex partner in the last 6 months. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was consistently associated with decreased sexual risk behaviors, as well as with reporting a HIV-negative or status unknown partner. The odds of sexual risk behaviors differed by sex; and were generally higher among participants reporting a HIV-positive partner, but continued among those with a HIV-negative or status unknown partner. These data support ART as a means of HIV prevention. Engaging in sexual risk behaviors primarily with HIV-positive partners was not widely practiced in this setting, emphasizing the need for couples-based prevention."
9697,0.001,1.0000,"Abuse of methamphetamine (METH) is a frequent comorbidity among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. In cell cultures and animal models, METH accelerates retroviral replication. To determine whether METH increases HIV replication in humans, we evaluated HIV loads in HIV-positive METH users and nonusers. We studied 3 groups: Tox+, active METH use and positive urine toxicology results; METH(+)Tox-, previous METH dependence/abuse and negative urine toxicology results; METH(-)Tox-, no METH dependence/abuse and negative urine toxicology results. Tox+ subjects' plasma virus loads were significantly higher than METH(+)Tox- and METH(-)Tox- subjects'; cerebrospinal fluid virus loads showed a similar but nonsignificant trend. Stratification by use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) revealed that virus loads were higher only in those Tox+ subjects who reported receiving HAART. In contrast, abstinent former METH abusers (METH(+)Tox-) receiving HAART effectively suppressed viral replication. These data suggest that abstinence programs are a key component of effective treatment of HIV in METH-abusing populations."
3078,0.001,1.0000,"To examine whether recent intravenous use of cocaine might be associated with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, the authors studied 2,597 active intravenous drug users: 2,399 with recent cocaine injection and 198 with recent injection of heroin or other drugs but not cocaine. These subjects were adult residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding Maryland counties, recruited via outreach into the community between February 1988 and March 1989. In contrast to the first report on the cocaine-HIV association, the present study sample was not recruited solely from drug treatment programs. In the present study, estimated HIV seroprevalence was 26.4% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 10.6% among all other recent intravenous drug users; the relative odds estimate was 3.03. In the untreated segment of the sample, HIV seroprevalence was 26.0% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 8.9% among others (relative odds (RO) = 3.61). The estimated degree of association did not change appreciably when multiple logistic regression was used to hold constant potentially confounding and/or mediating variables such as receptive anal intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of injection equipment obtained at shooting galleries (RO = 2.64). Augmenting these cross-sectional data, preliminary prospective data showed excess risk of HIV seroconversion among recent cocaine injectors (estimated relative risk = 2.11). While other research has examined the cocaine-HIV association, the present study differs in that it has allowed a test for whether the association was a spurious artifact of studying drug users recruited solely from drug treatment programs, a broad array of alternative determinants of HIV infection have been held constant, and the association has been examined with seroconversion data. The results lend support to the abiding concern about the risk of HIV infection among cocaine users."
9541,0.001,1.0000,"Differences in the uptake and time to initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the virological response to HAART, and survival from AIDS by transmission category were analyzed. A multicenter hospital-based cohort of HIV-infected patients attending 10 hospitals in Spain from January 1997 to December 2003 was used. Cross-checks with the National AIDS Registry were performed. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the impact of transmission category on time to HAART initiation, viral suppression (defined by first HIV-1 RNA viral load measurement <500 copies/ml after HAART), and survival from AIDS. Of 4643 patients, 73% were men and 56% were injecting drug users (IDUs). A statistically significant interaction was found between transmission category and previous non-HAART antiretroviral treatment (ART) (p < 0.05). Among ART naive patients, IDUs had a 33% lower risk of initiating HAART compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) [HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.57-0.79)]. No differences by transmission categories were seen among patients with prior non-HAART ART. IDUs had poorer viral load (VL) suppression than MSM [HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.99)] adjusting by baseline VL, AIDS diagnosis, and prior ART. Mortality from AIDS was two and a half times higher in IDUs than MSM [HR 2.51 (95% CI 1.03-6.1)]. Among patients who access the hospital network, IDUs have a lower uptake of HAART, have worse virological suppression, and have higher mortality after AIDS diagnosis. There is a need to extend the programs in order to enhance access and adherence of IDUs to HAART and consider the treatment of drug addiction as an integral part of the treatment for HIV infection."
7107,0.001,1.0000,"Development of drug resistance is the inevitable consequence of incomplete suppression of virus plasma levels in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy. Resistance mutations previously characterized have been found in B subtype viruses of developed countries. Moreover, mutation profiles for non-B and more divergent B subtype viruses found in developing countries shall be analyzed together with their ex vivo phenotyping in order to establish an exact correlation between the genotyping data and the clinical management counseling for those uncommon virus subtypes. In the present study, we evaluated the mutation profile for individuals infected with B subtype and non-B subtype viruses. Viral DNA fragments corresponding to the RT gene were amplified, sequenced, and subtyped. Phenotyping analysis for reverse transcriptase nucleoside (NRTI) and nonnucleoside inhibitor susceptibility was performed using the recombinant virus assay technology. Brazilian non-B subtypes (subtype F, n = 4, and subtype A, n = 1) isolates showed essentially the same B subtype mutation profile, presenting an NRTI drug resistance with similar MIC50% and MIC90% values for all drugs analyzed regardless of their subtypes. A strong cross-resistance phenotype among AZT, 3TC, and abacavir could be seen in all isolates analyzed. A novel result was that some RT sequences not only revealed the presence of G333D/E mutations but also correlated to the presence of mutation T386I that could abrogate the M184V-surpassing effect of L210W or L210W plus G333D/E. These findings suggest that Brazilian non-B subtype HIV-1 strains use an identical RT drug resistance mutation pattern when compared to B isolates and will contribute to the validation of the genotypic and phenotypic tests in these predominant worldwide-spread viral variants."
6533,0.001,1.0000,"The complex interaction between HIV-1 infection and Mycobacterium avium was studied. Viral burden was assessed, as well as immune response to HIV-1 in the context of Myco. avium infections. We also examined serum cytokine levels and cytokine release by blood mononuclear cells in HIV-1-infected subjects, infected or not with Myco. avium. Undetectable serum levels of IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 were found in normal controls and in groups I, II and III of HIV-1-infected subjects. Moderate levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were found in the sera of group IV patients. When group IV was subdivided into subjects with and without Myco. avium infections, subjects with Myco, avium infections were shown to have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 than those with other infections. Blood mononuclear cells from controls and HIV subjects were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and cytokine levels assessed. Cells from group II patients were shown to secrete normal levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and lower levels of IL-1 beta; group III subjects released higher levels of IL-6. Patients in group IV had blood cells that released elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and lower levels of IL-1 beta. Group IV subjects with Myco. avium infections had blood cells that released higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 than group IV subjects with other infections. Assessment of viral burden in cells of HIV-1-infected subjects revealed that Myco. avium-infected subjects had a higher level of virus burden and a lower level of lymphoproliferative response to an inactivated gp120-depleted HIV-1 antigen than AIDS subjects with other infections. These data suggest that Myco. avium infections in HIV-1-infected subjects hasten the progression of viral disease, enhance cytokine release and contribute to the anergy to viral antigens."
5867,0.001,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a safe, effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after renal transplantation. However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency."
5026,0.001,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is still the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis world wide. Recently, however, there has been quite dramatic improvement in the understanding of HBV associated liver disease and its treatment. It has become clear that high viral replication is a major risk factor for the development of both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early studies have shown lamivudine lowers the risk of HBV associated complications. There are currently three nucleos(t)ides licensed, in addition to interferon, and there are more drugs coming to the market soon. Interferon or its pegylated counterpart are still the only options for treatment with defined end points, while nucleos(t)ides therapy is used mostly for long term treatment. Combination therapies have not been shown to be superior to monotherapy in naive patients, however, the outcome depends on how the end point is defined. Interferon plus lamivudine achieves a higher viral suppression than either treatment alone, even though Hbe-seroconversion was not different after a one year treatment. HBV-genotypes emerge as relevant factors, with genotypes ""A"" and ""B"" responding relatively well to interferon, achieving up to 20% HBsAg clearance in the case of genotype ""A"". In addition to having a defined treatment duration, interferon has the advantage of lacking resistance selection, which is a major drawback for lamivudine and the other nucleos(t)ides. The emergence of resistance against adefovir and entecavir is somewhat slower in naive compared to lamivudine resistant patients. Adefovir has a low resistance profile with 3%, 9%, 18%, and 28% after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while entecavir has rarely produced resistance in naive patients for up to 3 years."
7081,0.001,1.0000,"The route of transmission in more than 50% of the patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is unknown. Only a minority of patients have had a previous blood transfusion; sporadic spread seems to be much more important, although the role of inapparent parenteral exposure is yet to be established. Aim of this study was to investigate if a relationship exists between history for exposure to known risk factors, concurrent HBV status and histological findings (presence of cirrhosis) in patients with chronic HCV liver disease. We studied 86 subjects with chronic HCV liver disease, subdivided according to their HBV status. Fifty four patients were anti-HBV negative; in the remaining 32 subjects, antibodies to HBV were found. Our data show that: 1) history for exposure to known risk factors is more likely to be present in patients with chronic HCV liver disease and concurrent positivity for antibodies to HBV than in anti-HCV positive patients without HBV antibodies (62.5% vs 38.9%); and 2) the incidence of liver cirrhosis is higher in anti-HCV positive patients with anti-HBV antibodies than in exclusively anti-HCV positive patients (56.2% vs 12.9%). We conclude that the association of history for exposure to known risk factors and anti-HBV positivity could be a marker of progression from mild to severe liver damage in patients with chronic HCV liver disease (i.e. in the absence of both identifiable risk factors and HBV antibodies, HCV infection could have a less severe clinical outcome). Therefore, in these patients a closer follow-up and earlier interferon therapy are probably needed."

Only two patients with HIV and L. monocytogenes have been attended in our hospital since the beginning of aids epidemic in 1981. Case 1: a man with HIV and 364 CD4+ cells/mm3 presented fever and occipital headache. The cerebral scan was normal and L. monocytogenes grew in licuor culture. He was outcome after treatment with ampicillin and tobramycin. Case 2: a 47 years old man with HIV, 44 CD4+ cells/mm3 and hepatic virus C cirrhosis was admitted to the hospital because fever and abdominal distension. He was on menstrual pentamidine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed and the patient begun treatment with ceftriaxone. The patient dead 72 hours later with hepatic encepholopathy. Postmortem L. monocytogenes grew. Listeriosis is an infrequent disease in patients with HIV that causes difficult diagnostic problems, principally in patients without prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole for PCP."
9729,0.001,1.0000,"Molecular evolutionary patterns of 62 HBV full-length genomes obtained from Belgian patients were characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed diverse HBV subgenotypes including A2 and A6 (46.8%), D1-D4 (38.8%), E (9.7%), C1 (1.6%), and B2 (1.6%). The study population consisted of patients with different ethnic origin (Caucasian, Turkish, Asian, Arab, and African). One HBV D/C recombinant isolate was identified, which encoded subtype adw2. An HBV subgenotype D4 with an aberrant subtype ayw4 was detected. Although none of the genotypes was associated with a specific disease outcome, several nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions were observed within the HBV preS1/S and X genes, particularly among patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection and patients with cirrhosis. Within the immunological domain of the HBsAg gene, the most frequent substitutions were sT125M and sT118A. High rates of precore and basal core promoter mutations were detected in patients infected with genotype D of HBV. Almost half of the patients who received lamivudine therapy for at least 1 year had HBV variants associated with lamivudine drug resistance. In conclusion, the most common HBV genotypes in West Europe (A and D) also prevail in Belgium. The highest degree of genetic diversity was detected in HBV genotype D. In addition, this study reveals the circulation of exotic HBV genotypes B, C, and E in Belgium. J. Med. Virol. 82:379-389, 2010. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
2931,0.001,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection leads to a state of CD4 lymphopenia and generalized immune activation with subsequent development of opportunistic infections and neoplasms. The use of highly active antiretroviral treatment has dramatically improved the clinical outcome for HIV-infected patients, but the associated cost and toxicity and the eventual development of drug resistance have underscored the need for additional therapeutic strategies. Immune-based therapies, such as treatment with cytokines or immunosuppressants, adoptive immunotherapy, and therapeutic immunizations, are being intensely investigated as potential supplements to antiretroviral therapy. Although much data have been generated as a result of these efforts, to date there has been little evidence of the clinical efficacy of these strategies. Randomized clinical studies remain critical in evaluating the clinical significance and the role of immune-based therapies in the therapeutic armamentarium against HIV."
