9061,0.025,5.0000,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "
8240,0.02,4.0000,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
8267,0.02,4.0000,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
2359,0.02,4.0000,"There is growing international concern that food insecurity may negatively impact antiretroviral (ARV) treatment outcomes, but no studies have directly evaluated the effect of food insecurity on viral load suppression and antiretroviral adherence. We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
8417,0.02,4.0000,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
3126,0.02,4.0000,"The aim of immune-based therapies in HIV infection is to enhance numbers and function of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes especially specific anti-HIV cellular immune responses in order to allow immune control of viral replication. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in phase II trials. Intermittent administration of subcutaneous IL-2 results in substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in most HIV-patients. Two large-scale phase III international studies are addressing the key remaining question of the clinical benefit associated with CD4 cell expansions in HIV-infected patients receiving IL-2. Other cytokines including interferon-alpha are currently under investigation in phase II trials. The goal of therapeutic immunizations is to enhance and broaden the immune system's ability to recognize HIV. Several vaccine candidates, also tested as immunogens for preventive vaccines, are currently studied in phase II trials in patients exhibiting viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. It has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys'models that therapeutic immunizations can result in the induction of strong CD4 and CD8 responses associated with viral control and prevention of clinical AIDS, following challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of chimeric SIV-HIV. The clinical efficacy of immune-based strategies remains to be demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Participation of immune system to control of viral replication may allow simplification of antiretroviral treatment which results in long-term adverse effects having impact in life quality of persons living with HIV."
9509,0.02,4.0000,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."
4836,0.02,4.0000,"Reported here is a case of double hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in an HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patient with antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen as the only serological marker (anti-HBc alone). Two different HBV genotypes were identified in this patient. A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection. In addition, it appears necessary to thoroughly study such patients in order to evaluate the impact of mixed HBV infection and triple HIV/HCV/HBV infection on morbidity."
524,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) continue to be major health concerns among men who have sex with men (MSM). The Internet both facilitates high-risk sexual encounters and provides opportunities for promoting healthy behaviours. This study compared self-reported HAV and HBV vaccination levels, based on demographics, health characteristics, hepatitis knowledge, attitudes and risk behaviours among MSM using an online survey posted from February through June 2005. Each participant (n = 968) reported whether they were vaccinated, infected or susceptible for hepatitis A and/or for hepatitis B. Men whose health-care provider recommended vaccination were 12.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.11, 20.55) times more likely to be vaccinated against HAV and 17.93 (95% CI 10.82, 29.70) times more likely to be vaccinated against HBV than those at risk of infection, respectively. These data provide essential information for public health professionals to successfully promote vaccination among members of this population."
904,0.015,3.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a complex phenomenon and patients do not always adhere for a variety of reasons. The quality of communication and the therapeutic relationship between health professionals and patients have an important influence on adherence, as do contextual and environmental factors. Little qualitative research exists that examines health care interactions in the context of adherence counselling. This article presents a case study of a discussion about nonadherence between a pharmacy assistant and a patient in a South African HIV context. A hybrid analytical approach revealed various themes such as how the topic of nonadherence is addressed, participants' responses to the patient's nonadherence, and the process of negotiating a new commitment to adherence. The case provides insight into the impact of contextual factors on the interaction and challenges involved in discussing nonadherence-in particular, the patient's attempts to save face, the pharmacy assistant's irritation and anger, and the patient's expressed regrets. This case raises questions around issues of patient agency. Health professionals are encouraged to consider the influence of context, lifeworld, and culture on patients' ability to adhere to treatment regimens. By working to improve communication processes and strengthen the therapeutic relationship, patients may be empowered to achieve better adherence levels."
6501,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis B infection affects two billion people worldwide and 350 million of these are chronically infected. Chronic hepatitis B virus is one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. If it is left untreated, about one-third of affected people will develop progressive and possibly fatal liver disease, like hepatic cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, five nucleos(t)ide analogs are approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. They are: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In this work, we developed and validated an UPLC-Tandem mass spectrometry assay method capable of monitoring lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir plasma concentrations. Both standards and quality controls (high, medium and low) were prepared in human plasma. Each sample was added with internal standard (5'amino-5'deoxy-thymidine) and then drugs were extracted through a protein precipitation protocol with acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid and then dried. The extracts were resuspended in water and then injected into the chromatographic system. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm 2.1 × 150 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both added with formic acid (0.05%). Accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision at quality controls levels fitted all FDA guidelines for all analytes, while matrix effects and recoveries resulted stable between samples for each analyte. Finally, we tested this method by monitoring plasma concentrations in 30 HBV+ patients with good results. This simple analytical method could represent a useful tool for the management of anti-HBV therapy."
3820,0.015,3.0000,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
8277,0.015,3.0000,"In a recent vaccine trial, we showed efficient control of a virulent simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-89.6P challenge by priming with a Gag-Pol-Env-expressing DNA and boosting with a Gag-Pol-Env- expressing recombinant-modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Here we show that long-term control has been associated with slowly declining levels of viral RNA and DNA. In the vaccinated animals both viral DNA and RNA underwent an initial rapid decay, which was followed by a lower decay rate. Between 12 and 70 weeks postchallenge, the low decay rates have had half-lives of about 20 weeks for viral RNA in plasma and viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes. In vaccinated animals the viral DNA has been mostly unintegrated and has appeared to be largely nonfunctional as evidenced by a poor ability to recover infectious virus in cocultivation assays, even after CD8 depletion. In contrast, in control animals, which have died, viral DNA was mostly integrated and a larger proportion appeared to be functional as evidenced by the recovery of infectious virus. Thus, to date, control of the challenge infection has appeared to improve with time, with the decay rates for viral DNA being at the lower end of values reported for patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy."
3112,0.015,3.0000,"After the infusion of HIV-1 virus into a host cell, RNA is reverse transcribed to dsDNA, which persists intracellular to the infected cell in a variety of forms. Numerous in-house assays have been developed for the quantification of the different cellular HIV-1 DNA forms; these implement conventional or real-time PCR methodology. In this review we discuss recent findings about the longitudinal monitoring of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA in naïve and pre-treated patients, as a marker for clinical progression, treatment initiation and long-term success of HAART. These findings underline the importance of monitoring HIV-1 DNA in clinical practice, in addition to HIV-RNA and CD4(+) T Cell counts, for the better assessment of HIV-treatment and disease progression. The lack of a standardized real-time PCR assay is major impediment to more wide-spread HIV-1 DNA monitoring."
2628,0.015,3.0000,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "
1165,0.015,3.0000,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
6461,0.015,3.0000,"This study was designed to provide a preliminary assessment of the occurrence of tuberculosis exposure, infection and disease within a national sample of infants and children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure or infection, and to determine the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates resistant both to isoniazid and rifampin in these patients or their adult source contacts. A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted of infants and children with HIV exposure or infection evaluated by pediatric HIV referral centers in the United States comprising the pediatric units or subunits of the Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trials Group (PACTG). Seventy of 72 sites during a mean period of 5 (range, 1 to 12) years participated in this study and had provided care for 14,038 patients. There were 75 cumulative total cases of tuberculosis disease seen since each site was established. Therapy for asymptomatic infection was given to another 40 children and for tuberculosis exposure to 71 children. Annualized case rates were 478/100,000 for sites established in 1990 to 1992, 117/100,000 for 1988 to 1989, 63/100,000 for 1986 to 1987 and 58/100,000 for 1981 to 1985 (P = 0.05, Spearman's p test for trend). By comparison, the 1992 age-specific tuberculosis case rate for all U.S. children < 5 years was 5.5/100,000. Twenty percent of isolates from PACTG patients and 15% of isolates from adult source contacts were resistant to isoniazid and rifampin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5827,0.015,3.0000,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
1082,0.015,3.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), the standard of care for HIV-1 infection, is considered to be successful when plasma viremia remains below the detection limit of commercial assays. Yet, cART fails in a substantial proportion of patients after the apparent success. No laboratory markers are known that are predictive of cART outcome in initial responders during the period of undetectable plasma viremia."
2926,0.015,3.0000,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
1679,0.015,3.0000,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."
7435,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share overlapping, large worldwide distribution. The implications of coinfection are being explored because of the importance of these viruses and demographic factors that favor coinfection. The nervous system is affected by HIV in a variety of ways resulting in significant disease of all levels of the nervous system. Emerging evidence that HCV can also impact the nervous system raises concerns that detrimental interactions might occur. Several reports addressing the manifestations of coinfection support independent contributions for both HIV and HCV on central nervous system performance, but not on distal sensory neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing reveals independent contributions resulting in poorer performance in coinfection in several drug-abusing cohorts. Motor physiologic testing substantiates performance deficits from HCV in coinfected subjects as does testing in treatment naive coinfected subjects. Although ongoing deficits attributed to HCV may be seen during HIV treatment, these deficits may be less apparent in advanced HIV disease. Current evidence supports independent contributions of HCV and HIV to neurological impairment. Preliminary evidence suggests that coinfection-related impairment does not appear to accelerate HIV-1-associated cognitive disease."
1150,0.015,3.0000,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
5955,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virus which has been known to cause acute and chronic necro-inflammatory disease of the liver. It is the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. HIV is known to have a negative impact on the natural disease outcome and immune response of HCV infection, whereas the reverse remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of HCV co-infection on recovery of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and liver enzyme levels before and after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV/HCV co-infected patients."
9007,0.015,3.0000,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
9485,0.015,3.0000,"CD4 + lymphocyte counts are routinely ordered during the early phases of antiretroviral therapy and for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients. Flow cytometry is the standard methodology for CD4 counts in Brazilian reference laboratories. However, these laboratories are located in large cities, frequently distant from patients, thus limiting patient access and delaying results. We compared a point-of-care test with flow cytometry determination of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in HIV patients. We analysed 107 consecutive samples by both methods. Overall, the point-of-care test performed well, with excellent agreement between it and the standard method. Test results were concordant for patients with CD4(+) T lymphocyte values above and below 200 cells/mm (3). The performance characteristics obtained were sensitivity 94% (95% CI 89.5-98.5%), specificity 93% (95% CI 88.2-97.8%), positive predictive value 86% (95% CI 79.4-92.6%), and negative predictive value 97% (95% CI 94-100%). The high sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test methodology suggest its utility as an alternative method for rapid measurement of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in patients with limited access to reference laboratories, enabling prompt therapeutic intervention for patients at risk of progression to AIDS.

6786,0.015,3.0000,"The authors examined hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination rates, hepatitis infection, and health care access in a gym-attending sample of 311 gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City. Overall, 69% reported having been vaccinated for HAV and 70% reported having been vaccinated for HBV. Multivariate models were used to identify predictors of HAV and HBV vaccination, and younger men, HIV-positive men, and men who had access to a doctor or clinic were more likely to be vaccinated than older men, HIV-negative men, and men without access to a doctor or clinic. Men with health insurance coverage were more likely to have received HBV vaccination than men without coverage. Findings indicate that there is still a significant proportion of unvaccinated men in our sample."
7631,0.015,3.0000,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents one of the strongest predictors of progression to AIDS, yet it is difficult for most patients to sustain high levels of adherence. This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85% were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37% of subjects were Caucasian and 89% acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79% by SR and 65% by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue."
531,0.015,3.0000,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
3280,0.015,3.0000,"Cryptosporidium spp. is a major cause of diarrhea in developing countries, mainly affecting people with compromised immune systems in general and HIV-infected individuals with low CD4 + T-cell counts in particular. This infection is self-limiting in healthy persons; however, it can be severe, progressive and persistent in those who are immunocompromised. There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection. The authors recommend that this infection should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, weight loss and dehydration in general and in diarrheal individuals with < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3)."
4831,0.015,3.0000,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."

SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
6413,0.015,3.0000,"A methodology based on micellar liquid chromatography to monitor five antiretroviral drugs (lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and efavirenz) was proposed. Antiretrovirals were studied in sets of three, corresponding to each highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regime, prescribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-infected patients. Four aqueous micellar mobile phases buffered at pH 7 were optimized to separate these compounds, using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the tensioactive, and 1-propanol or 1-pentanol as the organic modifier. The composition of each mobile phase was optimized for each antiretroviral. The common separation conditions were: C18 apolar column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size), UV detection set at 214 nm, and mobile phase running at 1 mL min(-1) without controlling the temperature. The finally suggested method was validated for five analysed antiretroviral drugs following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of: linearity between 0.5 and 50 ppm (r(2) > 0.9995), sensitivity (LOD lower than 0.25 ppm), intra- and inter-day precision (<7.1 and <5.2%, respectively) and accuracy (recovery 88.5-105.3% and 93.5-101.3%, respectively), as well as robustness (<6.5%). The proposed method was used to monitor the level of antiretrovirals in the serum of AIDS patients. The suggested methodology was found to be useful in the routine analysis of antiretrovirals in serum samples."
2656,0.015,3.0000,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."
4563,0.015,3.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
4488,0.015,3.0000,"A case of a false-positive result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) confirmatory immunoblot-based assay is described. Repeatedly borderline reactive anti-HIV screening enzyme immunoassay result obtained in a local hospital resulted in directing the sample to the Slovenian HIV/AIDS Reference Laboratory. In the Reference Laboratory, both anti-HIV screening assays and confirmatory Western blot were negative, while a confirmatory test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) was anti-HIV-1 positive due to sgp120 and gp41 reactivity. The results of serological testing of the second sample obtained three weeks later were completely identical, while in the third sample obtained 5 months later, seroreversion was observed. Due to a negative dynamics in anti-HIV serological profile and repeatedly negative results of the molecular tests for HIV-1 and HIV-2, HIV infection was excluded and the results of test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score were finally interpreted as false positive."
1691,0.015,3.0000,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
2416,0.015,3.0000,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

3986,0.015,3.0000,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."

3643,0.015,3.0000,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
240,0.015,3.0000,"The genetic heterogeneity and transcription activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR region and tat gene have been examined. Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
1795,0.015,3.0000,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
193,0.015,3.0000,"To determine the types and rates of tumors which may be associated with HIV infection in women, we used cancer incidence data from New York and northern New Jersey. We examined changes in incidence of selected cancers in women aged 20-49 years and compared groups differing in incidence of AIDS. Black women were compared to white women in New York City and in the remainder of New York State; for cervical cancer, rates were also compared for Blacks and Whites in northern New Jersey. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in women increased in New York City, beginning in 1982 for Blacks and in 1984 for Whites, but remained stable in the remainder of New York State. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in New York women doubled in Blacks after 1982 whereas incidence trends in Whites were unchanged. No consistent variation was seen in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease. Cervical cancer in New York and northern New Jersey Blacks declined over the same period by approximately 40% for invasive tumors and 50% for in situ lesions. The HIV epidemic is associated with substantial excesses of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women. The absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in upstate New York women suggests the existence of a geographically restricted co-factor(s) for Kaposi's sarcoma in addition to HIV. If HIV affected cervical cancer incidence through 1988, its impact was small compared to the striking decreases which followed widespread adoption of Papanicolaou screening."
3951,0.015,3.0000,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
2115,0.015,3.0000,"We retrospectively studied MBP genotypes in patients with malaria, tuberculosis (TB), and persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriage, in clinics and hospitals in The Gambia. Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."

Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."
1516,0.015,3.0000,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "

The CC genotype at rs12979860 of the IL28B is associated with greater rates of spontaneous clearance of HCV and response to antiviral therapy. IL28B acts on the interferon-stimulated genes through the JAK-STAT pathway, which is related to the development of insulin resistance.

3440,0.015,3.0000,"Although Elvitegravir (EVG) is a newly developed antiretrovirals drug to treat the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), drug resistance has already been found in clinic, such as E92Q/N155H and Q148H/G140S. Several structural investigations have already been reported to reveal the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance. As full length crystal structure for HIV-1 integrase is still unsolved, we herein use the crystal structure of the full length prototype foamy virus (PFV) in complex with virus DNA and inhibitor Elvitegravir as a template to construct the wild type and E92Q/N155H mutant system of HIV-1 integrase. Molecular dynamic simulations was used to revel the binding mode and the drug resistance of the EVG ligand in E92Q/N155H. Several important interactions were discovered between the mutated residues and the residues in the active site of the E92Q/N155H double mutant pattern, and cross correlation and clustering methods were used for detailed analysis. The results from the MD simulation studies will be used to guide the experimental efforts of developing novel inhibitors against drug-resistant HIV integrase mutants. "
9443,0.015,3.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation."
2818,0.015,3.0000,"Hepatic steatosis is an emerging cause of morbidity in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced HIV patients. The influence of steatosis on fibrosis is poorly understood. We report two cases of rapid evolution of disseminated macrovacuolar steatofibrosis to cirrhosis. Both patients had no history of alcohol abuse, nor intravenous drug use and were tested negative for HCV (PCR RNA) and had no HBS antigen. Patient 1 had a past history of hypertrygliceridemia, but controlled with dietetic measures for 4 years prior to biopsy. The first hepatic biopsy showed a disseminated macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The patient had then cytolysis and an uncontrolled HIV viral load. The second biopsy was performed two years later, and HIV was controlled by a new line of ART. It showed a regression of the steatosis (10%) and a progression of the fibrosis with signs of cirrhosis. Patient 2 had a long history of HIV infection. He also had an uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The first biopsy was realised during a period of uncontrolled HIV infection and elevated liver enzymes. The biopsy showed a major macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The second biopsy was realised 6 years after and showed the same steatosis and signs of cirrhosis. The HIV infection was then under control. Observations reported here show a rapid evolution of liver steatosis to cirrhosis in HIV positive / HCV negative patients, despite the control of HIV infection. The implication of HAART remains unclear. In the era of HAART, liver steatosis can rapidly evoluate to cirrhosis without any risk factor except ART."
4194,0.01,2.0000,"Rare human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected individuals, termed elite suppressors (ES), maintain plasma virus levels of <50 copies/ml and normal CD4 counts without therapy. The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."
2555,0.01,2.0000,"There is a growing need to develop services for women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, despite the reluctance of many to seek help. Yet, there is limited knowledge of the forces that act as barriers to health-seeking behaviors among these women. In the analysis of this focus group study of 46 women with HIV, eight distinct categories of perceived barriers to care were identified. These were: Lack of knowledge on the part of health care providers, fear of negative treatment, insensitivity of health care providers, fear by providers, lack of patient education, lack of confidentiality, lack of honesty, and blaming the victim. The women's descriptions of their experiences with health care providers are presented and discussed in the context of the potential impact of such behaviors on women's willingness to accept or continue treatment for HIV infection."

467,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide, responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality from chronic liver disease. Conflicting findings on the possible association between HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity, indicating inactive HBsAg carrier status, and atherosclerosis have been reported. Platelet activation and aggregation are central processes in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Mean platelet volume, a determinant of platelet activation, is a newly emerging risk factor for atherothrombosis. Elevated MPV levels have been identified as an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction in patients with coronary heart disease, and for death or recurrent vascular events after myocardial infarction. Moreover, increased platelet size has been reported in patients with vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, in patients with acute ischemic stroke, and essential hypertension. According to our knowledge, there has been no previous study of MPV in inactive HBsAg carriers. Therefore, we have investigated the possible association between HBsAg positivity and MPV."
1437,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B is still a major public health problem, aggravated by the growing phenomenon of immigration from areas with a high prevalence of infection with this virus. In the last few years, marked progress has been achieved in diagnostic methods, knowledge of the natural history of the disease and in therapeutic options, including liver transplantation, which has improved survival in these patients. These advances have been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of decision making. Six treatments have currently been approved for hepatitis B, including two interferon formulations--standard and pegylated--and four neucleos(t)ide analogs, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, as well as two further drugs that are used in patients coinfected with HIV, tenofovir and emtricitabine. However, none of the current treatments is able to eradicate the virus and consequently prolonged treatments are often required with the consequent risk of generating resistance. For this reason, as well as the heterogeneity of the natural history of the disease, there is a lack of consensus on the indications for treatment and the parameters in which treatment should be based, the most suitable drug or drug combination, and the criteria to be used to continue, modify or suspend treatment. Therefore, despite the enormous progress made, numerous questions remain that make the clinical management of these patients a major challenge."
2651,0.01,2.0000,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus are predisposed to develop a variety of common and uncommon infectious and neoplastic pulmonary diseases. Clinical information that can stratify the risk of occurrence of these pulmonary conditions includes: 1) CD4 cell count-the most important determinant; 2) concurrent antimicrobial therapy; 3) prior travel history; 4) known latent infections that may reactivate: and 5) underlying respiratory disease. Specific pulmonary diseases are discussed including: bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, mycobacterial and fungal infections, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and lung cancer. A differential diagnosis can be generated based on the chest radiographic pattern. Focal or multifocal areas of consolidation usually represent conventional bacterial pneumonia or, less commonly, tuberculosis. In severely immunocompromised patients, unusual diseases causing consolidation should be considered including: Rhodococcus infection, nocardiosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and lymphoma. Nodules can be present in tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Kaposi sarcoma. Interstitial opacities are common in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, histoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Cavitation and cysts are features of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis, aspergillosis, and lung cancer. Disease of the airways is increasingly recognized in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Lymphadenopathy is most common in mycobacterial infection, but can be a feature of fungal infection, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and lung cancer. The combined use of clinical information, knowledge of typical conditions associated with the human immunodeficiency syndrome, and radiographic patterns offers a useful approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary disease in the patient with the human immunodeficiency virus."
8165,0.01,2.0000,"Over the last few years, a relative decline of the morbidity and mortality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in industrialised countries has been observed due to the use of a potent combined therapy known as high active antiretroviral therapies (HAARTs). It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."
1360,0.01,2.0000,"TNFα has been shown to play a role in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced insulin resistance (IR). Polymorphism of the IL28B gene that encodes IFN-lambda 3 may be associated with IR through modulation of TNFα. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype, the level of TNFα activation and the degree of IR in patients with chronic hepatitis C. One hundred and thirty-three nondiabetic genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with biopsy proven noncirrhotic hepatitis C were investigated for IR (using HOMA index), IL28B rs12979860 genotype and fasting circulating levels of soluble receptor 1 of TNFα (sTNFR1) and adipokines: leptin, adiponectin and IL-6. The HOMA-IR was positively correlated with serum levels of leptin (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) and sTNFR1 (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) but not with IL-6 or adiponectin. IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was observed in 35% patients. Genotype CC and nongenotype CC patients were similar in terms of HOMA-IR (means 1.6 ± 0.9 vs 1.7 ± 1.4) and had similar circulating levels of sTNFR1 and adipokines. Independent factors associated with IR were ferritin (OR = 1.002, P = 0.02), leptin (OR = 1.06, P = 0.02) and sTNFR1 (OR = 7.9, P = 0.04). This study suggests that in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic, HCV genotype 1-infected patients, there is no relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype and HOMA-IR or sTNFR1 level. HCV-related IR may be mediated through TNFα independent of IL28B genotype. "
8775,0.01,2.0000,"Leptin, adiponectin and IL18 are adipokines related with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in the general population. Treated HIV-1-infected patients with lipodystrophy may develop insulin resistance and proatherogenic dyslipidemia. We assessed the relationship between plasma adipokine levels, adipokine genetics, lipodystrophy and metabolic disturbances. Plasma leptin, adiponectin and IL18 levels were assessed in 446 individuals: 282 HIV-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral drugs (132 with lipodystrophy and 150 without) and 164 uninfected controls (UC). The LEP2410A>G, LEPRQ223R, ADIPQ276G>T, ADIPOR2-Intron5A>G and IL18-607C>A polymorphisms were validated by sequencing. Leptin levels were higher in UC than in HIV-1-infected, either with or without lipodystrophy (p<0.001 for both comparisons) and were lower in patients with lipodystrophy compared with those without lipodystrophy (p=0.006). In patients with lipodystrophy, leptin had a positive correlation with insulin and with HOMA-IR. Adiponectin levels were non-significantly different in UC and HIV-1-infected patients. Patients with lipodystrophy had lower adiponectin levels than non-lipodystrophy subjects (p<0.001). In patients with lipodystrophy, adiponectin was negatively correlated with insulin, HOMA-IR and triglycerides. Plasma IL18 levels were higher in HIV-1-infected patients compared with UC (p<0.001), and no differences were found according to the presence of lipodystrophy. In patients with lipodystrophy there was a negative correlation between IL18 levels and LDLc. Genetic analyses indicated no significant associations with lipodystrophy nor with insulin resistance or with lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, HIV-1-infected patients have reduced plasma leptin levels. This reduction is magnified in patients with lipodystrophy whose adiponectin levels were lower than that of non-lipodystrophy subjects. Plasma IL18 levels are increased in infected patients irrespective of the presence of lipodystrophy. The polymorphisms assessed are not associated with lipodystrophy or metabolic disturbances in treated HIV-1-infected patients."

Kidney graft rejection rates graft-survival rates appear to be similar to those in HIV-uninfected populations. A large multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of kidney and liver transplantation in HIV-infected patients is under way.

8326,0.01,2.0000,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
140,0.01,2.0000,"A population-based survey was carried out in the Kagera region of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1987 to determine the magnitude of HIV-1 infection and to study associated risk factors. The region was divided into one urban and three rural zones. A multistage cluster sampling technique was adopted. Antibodies to HIV-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot analysis. A total of 2,475 adults (aged 15-54 years) and 1,961 children (aged 0-14 years) was studied. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among adults was 9.6%, with a higher prevalence in the urban zone (24.2%) than in the three rural zones (10.0, 4.5 and 0.4%, respectively). The corresponding figures for children were 1.3% overall: 3.9% in the urban area and for the rural areas 1.2, 0.8 and 0.0%, respectively. The age-specific seroprevalence for adults was highest in the age group 25-34 years. The age-standardized sex-specific prevalence was higher among women than men in the urban zone, while it was the same in the rural zones. Change of sexual partners among adults was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 seropositivity. Travelling outside the region but within the country was also found to be associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection but only in the rural population."
4913,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses are endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, but data regarding the prevalence of hepatitis co-infections in HIV-positive individuals residing there are limited. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
698,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B remains a major public health problem in the United States, but public vaccination policy has targeted infants rather than the high-risk adults who constitute the vast majority of patients at imminent risk of infection. The effects of this policy were studied at a community health center in Boston. Adolescents and adults who attended a community health center between January 1, 1992 and May 31, 1993 and had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or another sexually transmitted disease (STD)--indications for vaccination according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--were identified through chart review. The vaccination rate and missed opportunities were determined. In addition, directors of Boston health centers were surveyed on hepatitis B vaccine at their clinics. Of 178 individuals with HIV or another STD and without serologic evidence of prior exposure to hepatitis B, two (1.1%) received the vaccine. There were 342 missed opportunities. Only two of 14 medical directors said their clinics routinely offered vaccine to individuals with STDs. The medical directors rated financial barriers as more important obstacles to hepatitis B vaccination than nonfinancial barriers. These results indicate that many high-risk adolescents and adults do not receive a preventive intervention that is federally recommended, potentially life saving, and cost effective. Inadequate public funding for vaccine may be a key barrier for this population."
6076,0.01,2.0000,"The transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 647 subjects who presented no apparent risk factors for the infection other than having had promiscuous heterosexual relations, heterosexual relations with people with an elevated risk of infection, or heterosexual relations with people infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty subjects were found to be seropositive for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The elevated risk factors included being the habitual partner of a person at risk of infection or of a person who was infected by human immunodeficiency virus, or being the partner of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The transmission of the virus was verified in 13 of 284 subjects (4.57%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons at risk and in 16 of 101 subjects (15.84%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. No significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus infection and a history of sexually transmitted infections, nor between human immunodeficiency virus infection and female subjects was found. These data suggest that the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can also spread through heterosexual relations, even if the possibility of becoming infected in this way seems at the moment limited to particular risk behaviors."
3507,0.01,2.0000,"The number of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) reached to almost 40 million, half of which are under antiretroviral treatment (ART). Although the introduction of this therapy significantly improved the life span and quality of PLWHA, metabolic complications of these people remains to be an important issue. These metabolic complications include hyperlipidemia, abnormal fat redistribution and diabetes mellitus, which are defined as lipodystrophy syndrome. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a neuropeptide secreted from intestinal L cells and recently developed GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) stimulate insulin secretion, improve weight control and reduce cardiovascular outcomes. This class of drugs may be a valuable medication in the treatment of HIV-associated metabolic adverse effects and extend the life expectancy of patients infected with HIV. "
6602,0.01,2.0000,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
5740,0.01,2.0000,"The atherogenic effects of some highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors (PI), may synergistically promote the acceleration of cardiovascular disease and increase the risk of death from cardiovascular events even in young HIV-infected people. Along with the endothelial dysfunction associated with visceral fat accumulation and related metabolic alterations of HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome (eg, insulin resistance), vascular injury has been associated with HIV-1 infection itself, with an autoimmune reaction to viral infection (vasculitis) and with a direct action of drugs included in HAART regimens. Clinical studies suggest that HIV-infected patients under PI-including HAART and with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered at risk for developing coronary artery disease, and that this risk increases with the time of exposure to HAART. A careful cardiovascular screening and monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART is needed according to the most recent clinical guidelines."

A retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult and adolescent patients newly diagnosed with HIV was undertaken over a 12-month period. The results showed that most patients (64%) were between 20 and 39 years old (age range 14-68 years, M:F ratio 1.4:1). Heterosexual practice was admitted to by 77% of patients. At the time of presentation most patients (53%) were asymptomatic while 24% had some symptoms and 21% had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The most common presentation was generalized lymphadenopathy (67%) which was significantly higher than skin rash (27%), oral candidiasis (24%), cough (24%), weight loss (24%) and pallor of mucous membranes (19%, p < 0.001). This study affirms that young people account for the majority of new cases of HIV infection. The heterosexual route was the predominant mode of transmission.

We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

I describe the recent development of kinetic biomarkers for LA and mitochondrial toxicity that involve the measurement of biosynthetic fluxes rather than static concentrations of molecules. The turnover of adipose-tissue components (lipids and cells) and tissue mitochondrial DNA is measured by the incorporation of deuterium from heavy water, using mass spectrometry. Preliminary results in animal models and humans, including the effects of NRTIs on mitochondrial DNA synthesis in rats and adipose-tissue lipid kinetics in HIV-associated LA, are reviewed. The results suggest that the kinetics of adipose-tissue components and mitochondrial DNA are measurable in vivo and that these measurements may prove useful as clinical biomarkers in patients with HIV/AIDS."

This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
4117,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates of 8 Ethiopian and 8 Swedish untreated AIDS-patients were examined for their sensitivity to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and leukocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate. This isolate exhibited a mutation at amino acid position 215. These results suggest that it should be possible to perform clinical trials in Ethiopia using the same dose regimens as in Sweden."
1255,0.01,2.0000,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
952,0.01,2.0000,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."

Thus, 213 Caucasian adult HIV-infected patients were studied, 111 of whom had HCV-coinfection and 68 were HCV-monoinfected. Patients with ethanol consumption >50 g/day, hepatitis B coinfection, non-infective liver diseases or HAART adherence <75% were excluded. LF was assessed by transient elastometry (TE, Fibroscan). Serum levels of MMPs (MMP -1,-2,-3,-8,-9,-10 and -13) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2 and -4) were measured by ELISA microarrays. Associations with LF were statistically analysed. Protease inhibitors, usually administered to patients with advanced LF were excluded from the analysis. Increased LF was significantly associated with d4T (P = 0.006) and didanosine (ddI) use (P = 0.007), months on d4T (P = 0.001) and on ARV (P = 0.025), duration of HIV (P < 0.0001) and HCV infections (P < 0.0001), higher HIV (P = 0.03) and HCV loads (P < 0.0001), presence of lipodystrophy (P = 0.02), male gender (P = 0.02), older age (P = 0.04), low nadir (P = 0.02) and current CD4(+) T-cells (P < 0.0001), low gain of CD4(+) T-cells after HAART (P = 0.01) and higher MMP-2 (P = 0.02) and TIMP-2 serum levels (P = 0.02). By logistic regression the only variables significantly associated with increased LF were: use of ddI (OR 8.77, 95% CI: 2.36-32.26; P = 0.005), male gender (OR 7.75, 95% CI: 2.33-25.64, P = 0.0008), HCV viral load (in log) (OR 3.53, 95% CI: 2.16-5.77; P < 0.0001) and age (in years) (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0003). We conclude that only higher HCV viral load, older age, male gender, and use of ddI associated independently with increased LF in our study."

Fourteen participants were interviewed on two occasions. Two focus groups discussions were also conducted. Patients experienced important personal benefits as a result of HAART and the resulting clinical improvement. These benefits included a restoration of hope, self-esteem and personal agency. Patients were also relieved of the great fear which they had about the conditions of their death. The financial and social struggles introduced by AIDS illness continued after the introduction of HAART. The conclusion is that the HAART programs should provide more holistic care to patients to address the persistent family issues identified in this study. "
3023,0.01,2.0000,"We report a patient with Japanese minor β thalassemia and HIV-1 infection. The patient showed prolonged anemia, which was originally attributed to chronic parvovirus B19 infection. Twelve years later, the patient presented with exacerbation of microcytic anemia following cessation of anti-retroviral therapy; the exacerbation resolved when anti-retroviral therapy was resumed. Sequencing of the β globin gene revealed heterozygosity for a four-nucleotides deletion at codon 41/42 and minor β thalassemia was confirmed. Because HIV-1-infected patients frequently show anemia due to nutritional deficiencies, opportunistic infections, AIDS-related malignancies, drug treatment and a direct effect of HIV-1 on the bone marrow, it is likely to overlook other causes of anemia. Thalassemia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia even in HIV-1 infected patients, when microcytic anemia without iron deficiency is observed. Our case suggested that active HIV infection may have worsened β thalassemia, and early introduction of anti-retroviral therapy is beneficial for the recovery of anemia."
8854,0.01,2.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been a major global health problem for almost 3 decades, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 and effective prophylaxis and management of opportunistic infections, mortality from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has decreased markedly. In developed countries, this condition is now being treated as a chronic condition. As a result, rates of morbidity and mortality from other medical conditions leading to end-stage liver, kidney, and heart disease are steadily increasing in individuals with HIV. Because the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is transplantation, the demand for it has increased among HIV-infected patients. For these reasons, many transplant centers have eliminated HIV infection as a contraindication to transplantation, as a result of better patient management and demand."

7146,0.01,2.0000,"Potent combination antiretroviral therapy that was introduced in the mid-1990s for treatment of HIV-1 infection has resulted in unprecedented decreases in HIV-1 replication and increases in CD4+ T cell counts in many individuals. Coincident with the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy, substantial declines in AIDS-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. Although these declines strongly suggest that significant immune reconstitution is occurring, increasing evidence suggests that immune reconstitution is neither uniform nor complete in all treated individuals. Clinical data suggest that some HIV-1-associated malignancies have not declined despite the new therapies, and that not all treated individuals reconstitute CD4+ T cell numbers to normal values. Laboratory studies reveal that immune responses to ubiquitous antigens are reconstituted, but that responses to rarely encountered antigens, such as tetanus, are not reconstituted without repeat vaccination. Many questions remain concerning the extent and clinical significance of the immune reconstitution that occurs in the setting of antiretroviral drug therapy. A better understanding of the nature of the immune reconstitution that results from potent antiretroviral therapy is critical to the optimal clinical management of HIV-1-infected individuals, and may provide important insights into the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection as well."
3966,0.01,2.0000,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
2515,0.01,2.0000,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with various complications such as arthritis, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Hepatitis C is caused by chronic infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and eventually leads to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although an association between psoriasis and HCV has been reported, there have been no large case series to date. The aim of the present study was to outline the profiles of HCV-positive psoriatic patients. Patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis who visited Fukuoka University from 1991-2011 were sought in the database, and their medical records were manually checked for detailed information about serum liver enzymes, anti-HCV antibodies, medical history, and treatments and outcomes of both psoriasis and hepatitis. There were 54 (7.5%) anti-HCV antibody-positive patients among the 717 psoriatic patients detected. Male predominance (male/female ratio, 44:10) and late onset (median age, 55 years) were the characteristics of the 54 patients. HCV infection preceded the onset of psoriasis definitely in 80% and probably in 11%. Interferon therapy exacerbated 70% of pre-existing psoriasis cases, and induced de novo psoriasis in eight patients. Complication with diabetes mellitus was found in 35% of the patients. Our observations suggest that HCV infection can be an inducing factor for psoriasis. In hepatitis C patients, elevated tumor necrosis factor-α is known to cause progression of hepatic disease and possibly induces psoriasis in patients with a certain predisposition."
4567,0.01,2.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) drug-resistance testing is challenging for viral loads below 1,000 copies/mL, but, according to HIV-1 guidelines, it should be considered for improving patient management and treatment options. High-recovery and high-purity extraction methods can enhance standard performances of HIV-1 genotyping assays based on direct full-population sequencing. Aim of the present study was to evaluate performances of the NucliSENS easyMAG (NeM) (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, F) semi-automated nucleic acid extraction system combined with the direct full-population sequencing ViroSeq HIV-1 genotyping (Abbott, IL, US), for detecting drug resistance in samples with HIV-1 RNA<1,000 copies/mL (n=62). Data were compared with those from the ViroSeq manual extraction in 86 samples with HIV-1 RNA<1,000 copies/mL and studied on HIV-1 reference standards. HIV-1 genotyping was successful in 98% of samples extracted with NeM (61/62) and in 84% of those extracted with ViroSeq (72/86) (X(2)=8.508, p=0.004). HIV-1 RNA levels in samples successfully processed with NeM were significantly lower than those in manually processed ones (mean+/-SD, respectively, 285+/-222 copies/mL vs. 403+/-269 copies/mL) (p=0.004). For HIV-1 RNA levels <300 and 500 copies/mL, performances of HIV-1 genotyping with NeM were significantly high (97% and 98%, vs. 68% and 78% for manual extraction). As assessed on HIV-1 RNA reference standards, the detection rate at 200 copies/mL for HIV-1 genotyping with NeM extraction was 100%. In conclusion, these data support that HIV-1 direct full-population sequencing combined with NeM is associated with a significantly high success rate, thus improving the management of HIV-1 drug resistance in low viremic patients."

For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."

To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."

The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
258,0.01,2.0000,"Several members of the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor family have been shown to serve, with CD4, as coreceptors for entry by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). While coreceptor usage by HIV-1 primary isolates has been studied by several groups, there is only limited information available concerning coreceptor usage by primary HIV-2 isolates. In this study, we have analyzed coreceptor usage of 15 primary HIV-2 isolates, using lymphocytes from a donor with nonfunctional CCR5 (CCR5 -/-; homozygous 32-bp deletion). Based on the infections of PBMCs, seven of these primary isolates had an absolute requirement for CCR5 expression, whereas the remaining eight exhibited a broader coreceptor usage. All CCR5-requiring isolates were non-syncytium inducing, whereas isolates utilizing multiple coreceptors were syncytium inducing. Blocking experiments using known ligands for chemokine receptors provided indirect evidence for additional coreceptor utilization by primary HIV-2 isolates. Analysis of GHOST4 cell lines expressing various chemokine receptors (CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, BONZO, and BOB) further defined specific coreceptor usage of primary HIV-2 isolates. The receptors used included CXCR4, CCR1-5, and the recently described receptors BONZO and BOB. However, the efficiency at which the coreceptors were utilized varied greatly among the various isolates. Analysis of V3 envelope sequences revealed no specific motif that correlated with coreceptor usage. Our data demonstrate that primary HIV-2 isolates are capable of using a broad range of coreceptors for productive infection in vitro. Additionally, our data suggest that expanded coreceptor usage by HIV-2 may correlate with disease progression."

Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
8959,0.01,2.0000,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
9439,0.01,2.0000,"Characteristics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains and the host immune response against the virus are major determinants in the pathogenesis of AIDS. HIV isolates can be distinguished by their ability to infect and replicate to high titers in cells, to kill those cells, and to down-modulate the CD4 protein on the cell surface. In addition, their sensitivity to serum neutralization or enhancement of infection can be appreciated. The genetic sequences associated with these biologic and serologic properties have been localized and could eventually be helpful for antiviral therapy. These variations in properties of HIV strains appear to correlate with induction of neurologic and gastrointestinal disease by certain strains. In some cases, HIV can establish a silent, latent infection. The mechanisms involved are not well defined, but one concept involves the nef gene, which with some strains, can suppress virus replication. An important finding is that viruses recovered from individuals as they advance to disease have many properties in vitro of presumed virulence in the host, such as a wide cellular host range, cytopathicity, and resistance to the antiviral effect of Nef. The host immune response can control virus spread through antiviral antibodies or cellular immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies are not commonly found in infected individuals, suggesting that viruses ""escape"" this immune response. Instead, in some symptomatic patients, antibodies that enhance virus infection can be detected. The difference in sensitivity of a virus appears related to its envelope proteins. Cellular immune responses offer some promise in maintaining or eliminating virus infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The number and patterns of mutations in the patients who exhibited discrepant responses to HAART did not differ from those observed in patients who exhibited immunologic and virologic failure to therapy. Results indicate that many patients have prolonged immunologic benefits, despite the development of virologic failure and protease inhibitor mutations.

Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out."
3377,0.01,2.0000,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
1368,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-infected individuals have an increased risk of malignancy, especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Recently, several workers have noted a raised prevalence of lung cancer in HIV-positive subjects. We describe the diagnosis and clinical course for four HIV-seropositive patients who presented with lung cancer. All of the patients were young and were heavy smokers. They were all on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), although the adherence varied from poor to excellent. The CD4 cell counts of these patients ranged from 200 to 686 cells/microL and their viral loads ranged from undetectable to 29,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL. After initial diagnosis of HIV infection between 5 and 13 years previously, they all presented with advanced lung cancer, with a very short clinical course, and all four died within 2-9 months of diagnosis. A comparison of the incidence of lung cancer in patients with HIV infection at our centre with that in the general population suggests that there is an increased prevalence in the HIV-infected patients. We review the literature and discuss whether lung cancer in HIV infection is coincidental or related to the primary disease."
1792,0.01,2.0000,"Interactions between combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and lung cancer treatment are emerging clinical concerns. Among the reasons for that, one can observe the longer survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients since introduction of CART and the epidemiologic rising of lung cancer, mainly adenocarcinomas, in this population. In addition, the higher relative risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients compared with general population has been recently demonstrated. Patients' demography and disease characteristics differ from the general lung cancer population, although most cases occur in patients with a smoking history: HIV-infected subjects are generally younger and diagnosis frequently made at locally advanced or metastatic stages. The choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy and antiretroviral therapy is essential in the context of lung cancer (1) to minimize potential interactions and life-threatening toxicities particularly through cytochrome P450 interaction, (2) to implement adequate prevention of foreseeable toxicity, and (3) to fully reinforce antineoplastic and antiretroviral efficacy. Pharmacokinetics data and clinical cases pinpoint to potential life-threatening interactions between protease inhibitors/ritonavir and taxanes, vinca alkaloids, as well as the anilinoquinazolines erlotinib and gefitinib and irinotecan. Optimal choice of chemotherapy and CART in HIV-infected patients with lung cancer is an individualized multidisciplinary decision, involving clinical and antiretroviral history, and predicting potential adverse events and interactions."
5459,0.01,2.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in french patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy, questionnaire forms were mailed out in february 1997 to the heads of the 260 dialysis facilities. We documented number of patients on maintenance dialysis therapy (hemo and peritoneal dialysis) and for HIV infected dialysis patients: age, gender, cause and duration of ESRD, known duration of HIV infection, risk factors for HIV infection, HBV and/or HCV infection, presence of clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), total CD4 count and treatment with antiretroviral agents. Questionnaire forms were returned from 98% of the dialysis facilities. As of february 1997 some 22,707 patients with ESRD were treated by renal replacement therapy, 19,947 by hemodialysis (HD) and 2760 by peritoneal dialysis (PD). 82 patients with ESRD and HIV infection were reported corresponding to 0.36% prevalence rate of all patients undergoing dialysis at the time specified. The 82 study subjects with ESRD and HIV infection received hemodialysis (79 patients) or peritoneal dialysis (3 patients) in 42 facilities. Forty seven patients were treated in Paris and suburbs and 9 in our own center. All 82 patients comprised 63% men and 47% women which included patients coming from Africa (37%), Caribbean and Oceania (28%), Europe (35%) of a mean age of 41.8 years. Modes of transmission were homobisexuals 15%, heterosexuals 31%, intravenous drug abusers 17%, blood transfusion 17% and unknown 20%. The mean duration of HIV infection was 96 months (range 12-168 months) and the mean duration of ESRD was 58 months (range 1-235 months). HIV associated nephropathy was established in 31%. AIDS was diagnosed in 25 patients. Seventy one percent of the patients were receiving an antiretroviral drug (tritherapy in 25% of cases). In conclusion HIV prevalence rate among French dialysis patients is low and focused in Paris and oversea. Sexual transmission is the most important HIV contamination but blood transfusion transmission remains greater than in general HIV population. Survival has improved compared with the survival rate reported in the 1980s."
6017,0.01,2.0000,"We estimated seroincidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the prevalence of risk behaviors among injection drug users (IDUs) who accepted inpatient detoxification by 14-day methadone tapering treatment in the Shanghai Drug Abuse Treatment Center. We also evaluated the effect of an HIV/AIDS prevention education intervention on those IDUs. Data including demographic characteristics, HIV, HBV and HCV seroincidence, sexual and injection-related risk behaviors were collected from 101 IDUs. All subjects received HIV/AIDS prevention education during inpatient detoxification treatment. An HIV-knowledge questionnaire was used to evaluate the effects of this intervention. We found that risk behaviors, including unsafe sex and unclean injection practices, were common among the subjects. The seroincidence of HBV and HCV infection rates was 56.4% and 46.5%, respectively, but no HIV-infected case was found among the subjects. After participating in the HIV/AIDS prevention intervention, subjects' scores (M+/-SD) on the HIV-knowledge questionnaire were significantly improved from baseline (97.29+/-7.42 vs. 31.1+/-12.1). Our study confirmed that IDUs in Shanghai are a high-risk population for blood borne diseases such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C and HIV. HIV/AIDS prevention education increased HIV knowledge, improved understanding of HIV prevention methods and changed attitudes toward HIV/AIDS. Therefore, HIV/AIDS prevention education should to be an important component of drug treatment."
7977,0.01,2.0000,"Renal disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent comorbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The increase in life expectancy following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the long-term development of metabolic complications (such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia), hypertension, and vascular diseases can contribute to the increasing frequency in the recognition of renal impairment in HIV-infected patients. Some antiretroviral agents, and particularly tenofovir, have been associated with nephrotoxic drug effects, including decline in glomerular filtration rate, proximal tubular damage, and acute kidney injury. The occurrence of clinically evident renal toxicity in patients treated with HAART seems to be very low, but glomerular or tubular subclinical dysfunction may occur more frequently. Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring for the early recognition of renal abnormalities is recommended for all subjects receiving antiretroviral treatment. In this article, the current knowledge about the nephrotoxic effects of antiretroviral agents has been reviewed, and an algorithm for screening and management of HAART-related kidney disease is proposed in the light of the most recent clinical studies and international guidelines."

Between 1985, when most patients were tested for HIV infection, and 1993 3 possibly HIV-related suicides were reported to Haemophilia Centre Directors. It is argued that haemophilia comprehensive care may contribute to reducing some of the factors associated with suicide risk, and thus be a reason for this low incidence. It is suggested that the pattern of health care delivery developed for the haemophilia community might serve as a template for those treating others with HIV infection."
6240,0.01,2.0000,"To evaluate exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) in dental operators, we surveyed 297 students of the Dental School, University of Milano, and 526 dentists registered at the Italian Dental Association (A.M.D.I.) of Lombardia. Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."
5669,0.01,2.0000,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."
2450,0.01,2.0000,"The risk for dental hygienists to contract HIV and hepatitis B infection at work was studied in an international cohort of 167 dental hygienists from 13 countries. A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
5461,0.01,2.0000,"HIV-infected persons entering the criminal justice system (CJS) often experience suboptimal healthcare system engagement and social instability, including homelessness. We evaluated surveys from a multisite study of 743 HIV-infected jail detainees prescribed or eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) to understand correlates of healthcare engagement prior to incarceration, focusing on differences by housing status. Dependent variables of healthcare engagement were: (1) having an HIV provider, (2) taking ART, and (3) being adherent (≥95% of prescribed doses) to ART during the week before incarceration. Homeless subjects, compared to their housed counterparts, were significantly less likely to be engaged in healthcare using any measure. Despite Ryan White funding availability, insurance coverage remains insufficient among those entering jails, and having health insurance was the most significant factor correlated with having an HIV provider and taking ART. Individuals interfacing with the CJS, especially those unstably housed, need innovative interventions to facilitate healthcare access and retention. "
9004,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B infection (HBV) is prevalent worldwide. Overall prevalence is about 3 percent in Bangladesh. Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."
7497,0.01,2.0000,"To estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among men and women in Karachi, Pakistan. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult men and women in a peri-urban community of Karachi (Jam Kandah). Households were selected through systematic sampling from within all villages in the study area. All available adults within each household were interviewed about potential HCV risk factors. A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection. Of 1997 participants, 476 (23.8%) were anti-HCV positive. Overall, HCV infection was significantly associated with increasing age, ethnicity, and having received > or =2 blood transfusions, > or =3 hospitalizations, dental treatment and >5 injections among women. Among women, > or =2 blood transfusions [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.32], >5 injections during the past 6 months (aORs = 1.47), dental treatment (aOR = 1.31) and increasing age(aOR = 1.49), while among men, extramarital sexual intercourse (aOR = 2.77), at least once a week shave from barber (aOR = 5.04), > or =3 hospitalizations (aOR = 2.50) and increasing age (aOR = 1.28) were associated with HCV infection. A very high prevalence of HCV was found in the study population. Among women, unsafe health care practices, while among men extramarital sex, shaving from a barber and hospitalizations were associated with HCV infection. Efforts are needed to improve the safety of medical procedures to reduce the transmission of HCV in Pakistan [Corrections made in Summary after initial online publication.]."
3943,0.01,2.0000,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."

Difference in precART and cART failure sequences were explained by evolution and not by super-infection."
1096,0.01,2.0000,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."
7348,0.01,2.0000,"Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."

9798,0.01,2.0000,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have, in addition to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs), gained a definitive place in the treatment of HIV-1 infections. Starting from the HEPT and TIBO derivatives, more than 30 structurally different classes of compounds have been identified as NNRTIs, that is compounds that are specifically inhibitory to HIV-1 replication and targeted at the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Two NNRTIs (nevirapine and delavirdine) have been formally licensed for clinical use and several others are in preclinical or clinical development [thiocarboxanilide UC-781, HEPT derivative MKC-442, quinoxaline HBY 097 and DMP 266 (efavirenz)]. The NNRTIs interact with a specific 'pocket' site of HIV-1 RT that is closely associated with, but distinct from, the NRTI binding site. NNRTIs are notorious for rapidly eliciting resistance due to mutations of the amino acids surrounding the NNRTI-binding site. However, the emergence of resistant HIV strains can be circumvented if the NNRTIs, alone or in combination, are used from the start at sufficiently high concentrations. In vitro, this procedure has proved to 'knock-out' virus replication and to prevent resistance from arising. In vivo, various triple-drug combinations of NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine or efavirenz) with NRTIs (AZT, 3TC, ddI or d4T) and/or PIs (indinavir or nelfinavir) have been shown to afford a durable anti-HIV activity, as reflected by both a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and increased CD4 T-lymphocyte counts."
1796,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "

Pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccination and the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure to blood are the most effective strategies for preventing DHCP from occupational infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. Each dental health care facility should develop a comprehensive written program for preventing and managing occupational exposures to blood that: (1) describes the types of blood exposures that may place DHCP at risk for infection; (2) outlines procedures for promptly reporting and evaluating such exposures; and (3) identifies a health care professional who is qualified to provide counseling and perform all medical evaluations and procedures in accordance with the most current USPHS recommendations. Finally, resources should be available that permit rapid access to clinical care, testing, counseling, and PEP for exposed DHCP and the testing and counseling of source patients."
5905,0.01,2.0000,"The identification of HIV-1 coreceptors has provided a molecular basis for the tropism of different HIV-1 strains. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) mediates the entry of both primary and T cell line-adapted (TCLA) syncytia-inducing strains. Although macrophages (M phi) express CXCR4, this coreceptor is assumed to be nonfunctional for HIV-1 infection. We addressed this apparent paradox by infecting human monocyte-derived M phi with primary and TCLA isolates that were rigorously characterized for coreceptor usage and by adding the natural CXCR4 ligand, stem cell differentiation factor-1, to specifically block CXCR4-mediated entry. Our results show that primary HIV-1 isolates that selectively use CXCR4 productively infected both normal and C-C chemokine receptor-5-null M phi. By contrast, M phi supported the entry of CXCR4-dependent TCLA strains with variable efficiency but were not productively infected. Thus, the tropism of HIV isolates results from complex virus/host cell interactions both at the entry and postentry levels."
8635,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common in resource-limited settings but is frequently not diagnosed. The authors retrospectively tested specimens for HBV in HIV-infected Thai women who had participated in an antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinical study. A substantial proportion (27 of 211; 13%) of HIV-infected women were HBV coinfected. Among HIV/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact.

The lack of public programs for prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment contribute to the increase in the incidence and prevalence of diseases in general and especially sexually transmitted diseases. This article aims to estimate the prevalence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and syphilis among inmates at the Women's Penitentiary in the State capital of São Paulo, Brazil. All inmates were invited to participate in the study, which was divided into two stages: 1. STD/AIDS preventive workshops including interviews and 2. laboratory tests. The interview covered knowledge of STD/AIDS, risk behavior, and individual reproductive health history. A total of 262 women, with a mean age of 32.4 years and limited schooling, participated in more than one stage of the study. Prevalence rates were 14.5% for HIV, 16.3% for high-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, 4.8% for low-oncogenic-risk HPV probes, and 5.7% for syphilis.

6020,0.01,2.0000,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."

A cohort study was performed including LTR from 2000 to 2010 at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit. CDI was defined as diarrhea with a stool C. difficile positive test. Data analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), severity of CDI, rates of recurrence (<12 weeks), relapse (<4 weeks) and overall mortality. Predictors of CDI were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model; 970 LTR were followed for years. Overall prevalence of CDI was 18.9%. Incidence of CDI within 1 year of transplant was 12.4%. Severe CDI occurred in 29.1%. CDI recurrence and relapse rates were 16.9% and 9.7%, respectively. Independent predictors of CDI were year of transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.137, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.22; p < 0.001), white race (105/162 whites, HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.1; p = 0.035), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.045, p = 0.003) and LOS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.005-1.02, p < 0.001). Significant mortality was observed among LTR with CDI compared to those without CDI (p = 0.003). We concluded that CDI is common among LTR and is associated with higher mortality. "
919,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy is increasingly available in African communities. We set out to gain patient perceptions on factors that facilitate and challenge access and adherence to such therapy. We carried out two semi-structured interviews 12 months apart with 40 HIV-positive people drawn from three economically deprived townships in the Copperbelt, Zambia. We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes. HIV/AIDS is beginning to move from a hidden terminal disease to a chronic condition that is treatable."
5515,0.01,2.0000,"Immunosuppression may be etiologic for some skin cancers. We investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and solid-organ transplantation on skin cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study among elderly U.S. adults (non-Hispanic whites, age 67 years or older), using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare linked data. The study comprised 29,926 skin cancer cases (excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) and 119,704 controls, frequency-matched by gender, age and calendar year (1987-2002). Medicare claims identified solid-organ transplantation or HIV infection before cancer diagnosis/control selection. As negative controls, we evaluated other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension and depression) and cancers (breast, colon and prostate) not linked to immunosuppression. Odds ratios (ORs) compared prevalence in cases and controls, adjusted for matching factors and number of prior physician claims. Risks of Kaposi sarcoma (N = 602) and cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 1,836) were increased with solid-organ transplantation (OR [95%CI]: 11.06 [5.27-23.23] and 2.27 [1.00-5.15], respectively) and HIV infection (21.58 [11.94-38.99] and 2.41 [1.05-5.52], respectively). Solid-organ transplantation was also associated with increased risks of Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 1,286; OR [95%CI] 4.95 [2.62-9.34]) and other cutaneous sarcomas (N = 972; 4.19 [1.83-9.56]). Solid-organ transplantation was nonsignificantly associated with melanoma (N = 23,974; (OR 1.36 [95%CI 0.98-1.88]). Null or weak associations were observed for negative control medical conditions and cancers. Solid-organ transplantation and HIV infection were followed by increased risk for some skin cancer subtypes among elderly adults. These results highlight the potential role of immunity in development of skin cancers."

6886,0.01,2.0000,"Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) represents a valuable tool for genomic engineering due to its single-nucleotide precision, high nuclease activity, and low cytotoxicity. We report here systematic design and characterization of 28 novel TALENs targeting multiple regions of CCR5 gene (CCR5-TALEN) which encodes the co-receptor critical for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). By systemic characterization of these CCR5-TALENs, we have identified one (CCR5-TALEN-515) with higher nuclease activity, specificity, and lower cytotoxicity compared with zinc-finger nuclease (CCR5-ZFN) currently undergoing clinical trials. Sequence analysis of target cell line GHOST-CCR5-CXCR4 and human primary CD4 T cells showed that the double-strand breaks at the TALEN targeted sites resulted in truncated or nonfunctional CCR5 proteins thereby conferring protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro. None of the CCR5-TALENs had detectable levels of off-target nuclease activity against the homologous region in CCR2 although substantial level was identified for CCR5-ZFN in the primary CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that the CCR5-TALENs identified here are highly functional nucleases that produce protective genetic alterations to human CCR5. Application of these TALENs directly to the primary CD4 T cells and CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of infected individuals could help to create an immune system resistant to HIV-1 infection, recapitulating the success of ""Berlin patient"" and serving as an essential first step towards a ""functional"" cure of AIDS."
8899,0.01,2.0000,"Medication adherence is important for the success of nucleos(t)ide analogue (NUC) treatment for chronic hepatitis B. The aims of this study were to determine adherence to NUCs and factors associated with NUC adherence and to correlate NUC adherence with the occurrence of virological breakthroughs in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving NUC were asked to complete a survey every 3 months. Adherence was also assessed by healthcare providers in the clinic. Adherence rate was defined as the per cent of days the patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during the last 30 days. A total of 111 patients were studied. The mean age was 47.7 years, 73.9% were men, 57.7% were Asian, 42.3% had postgraduate education and 80% had private insurance. Sixty-nine (74.1%) patients reported 100% adherence in the survey, while 78 (83.9%) reported 100% adherence to their healthcare providers. Patients with 100% adherence based on the survey were older (P = 0.02), more likely to be men (P = 0.006), and had higher annual household income (P = 0.04) than those with <100% adherence. In the 80 patients who completed three surveys, viral breakthrough was observed in 1/46 (2.2%) with 100% adherence on all three surveys, 1/18 (5.6%) with <100% adherence on one survey and 3/16 (18.8%) with <100% adherence on ≥2 surveys, (P = 0.06). In conclusion, adherence to NUC therapy in our patients with chronic hepatitis B was high but self-reporting of adherence to healthcare providers may be inflated. Patients with chronic hepatitis B with better adherence to NUC therapy had a trend towards a lower rate of viral breakthroughs."
4996,0.01,2.0000,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
345,0.01,2.0000,"Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is generally high in most resource-limited settings. However, sub-optimal adherence occurs in a sizable proportion of patients, and is independently predictive of detectable viremia. We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."

The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."

The incidence of clinically overt toxoplasmosis was about 20% in the 167 hospitalized persons infected with the parasite. In 29% of 68 patients with suspected pneumocystosis, the infection could be verified. In 9% of 219 patients, Cryptosporidium sp. was found. In two persons, an infection with Strongyloides stercoralis was diagnosed. Except these AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, the incidence of parasitic infections in the Austrian HIV-infected population was found to be low, and, except for Entamoeba histolytica, not significantly exceeding the frequency of parasitic infections in non-HIV-infected Austrians. Compared to data on the frequency of opportunistic infections in AIDS-patients in other developed countries, toxoplasmosis as well as infections with Cryptosporidium sp. seem to be more often diagnosed in Austria, whereas pneumocystosis is slightly less frequently found."
4323,0.01,2.0000,"Fitness disadvantage of the transitional intermediates compared to the initial R5 viruses has been suggested to constitute one of the blockades to coreceptor switching, explaining the late appearance of X4 viruses. Using a simian model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor switching, we demonstrate in this study that similar molecular evolutionary pathways to coreceptor switch occur in more than one R5 simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(SF162P3N)-infected macaque. In infected animals where multiple pathways for expansion or switch to CXCR4 coexist, fitness of the transitional intermediates in coreceptor usage efficiency influences their outgrowth and representation in the infecting virus population. Dualtropic and X4 viruses appear at different disease stages, but they have lower entry efficiency than the coexisting R5 strains, which may explain why they do not outcompete the R5 viruses. Similar observations were made in two infected macaques with coreceptor switch, providing in vivo evidence that fitness disadvantage is an obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion."
709,0.01,2.0000,"In vitro proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was used to measure virus-specific cell-mediated immunity (vCMI) following neonatal woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection. Fifteen neonates were inoculated with the W8 strain of WHV. In 11, infection was resolved, and 4 became chronic carriers. Nineteen neonates were inoculated with the W7 strain and all became chronic carriers. Seven age-matched uninfected woodchucks served as controls. Virologic and vCMI profiles among the W8 and W7 infections were compared and related to the outcome of infection. Resolving woodchucks had robust, acute-phase vCMI to WHV antigens (core, surface, and x) and to several nonoverlapping core peptides. The acute-phase vCMI was associated temporally with the clearance of viral DNA and of surface antigen from serum at 14 to 22 weeks postinfection. In contrast, in approximately half of the W8 and W7 infections that progressed to chronicity, no significant acute-phase vCMI was detected. In the remaining carriers, acute-phase vCMI was observed, but it was less frequent and incomplete compared to that of resolved woodchucks. Serum viral load developed less rapidly in those carriers that had evidence of acute-phase vCMI, but it was still increased compared to that of resolving woodchucks. Thus, vigorous and multispecific acute-phase vCMI was associated with resolution of neonatal WHV infection. Absent or incomplete acute-phase vCMI was associated with the progression to chronic infection. By analogy, these results suggest that the onset of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans may be associated with deficiencies in the primary T-cell response to acute HBV infection."

In a cross-sectional study, cervical shedding of HSV DNA was detected in 43 (17%) cervical swab samples from 273 women seropositive for HSV-1, HSV-2, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Cervical shedding of HSV was significantly associated with oral contraception (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-12.2), use of depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.7), and pregnancy (aOR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.0-31.7). In the subgroup of women who were not pregnant and not using hormonal contraception (n=178), serum vitamin A was highly predictive of cervical HSV shedding: concentrations indicating severe deficiency, moderate deficiency, low-normal, and high-normal status were associated with 29%, 18%, 8%, and 2% prevalences of cervical HSV shedding, respectively (linear trend, P=.0002). Several factors appear to influence HSV reactivation in HIV-1 seropositive women."

Significant risk factors for early mortality included increasing degrees of malnutrition, age > 35 years, and HIV seropositivity. Among all the 1181 patients, 10.9% of the 414 patients with moderate to severe malnutrition died in the first 4 weeks compared with 6.5% of the 767 patients with normal to mild malnutrition (odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.7).

5107,0.01,2.0000,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
4987,0.01,2.0000,"The introduction of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy has transformed HIV-infection from an inevitably lethal disease to a chronic condition with a life expectancy comparable to that of people with diabetes mellitus. In recent years it has become evident that people living with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and it is expected that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease will rise accordingly. To investigate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV, we conducted a retrospective observational analysis using the clinical database of a large centre (Institute of Tropical Medicine) in the urban area of Antwerp, Belgium. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease among HIV infected subjects was found to be 3.0%. The development of chronic kidney disease was associated with age above 50 years, lower CD4 cell counts and Caucasian origin. Screening for chronic renal disorders and prevention of evolution toward chronic renal failure is a crucial challenge in the management of people living with HIV/AIDS."

Fourteen untreated and 2 treated patients experienced clinical progression (p = 0.09). The difference between baseline CD4 T-cell count and after 3 years, was -240/mm3 in the untreated group +19/mm3 in the HAART group (p < 10(-3)). A better immunological outcome was significantly associated with a HIV sexual contamination (p = 0.01), HAART (p = 0.01), high baseline CD4 T-cell count (p < 10(-3)) and low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.01). In the HAART group, the incidence rate of antiretroviral modification due to tolerance difficulties was 0.23+/-0.36/patient year. A sustained undetectable HIV viral load was correlated with a low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.003) and to be antiretroviral naive (p < 10(-3)). Thus, HAART provide a better immunological outcome in patients with high CD4 T-cell count. However, the CD4 decay slope after 3 years, the risk of therapeutic side-effects and the low risk of clinical progression do not support systematic treatment of those patients."

Sera from HIV-1-infected persons living in four geographically distant areas, Philadelphia (USA), Ribeirao Preto (Brazil), Marseille (France) and Kinshasa (Zaire), were tested for the presence of type-specific and group-specific cross-reacting neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 LAV and HIV-1 NDK in a continuous cell line MT4. The majority of type-specific antibodies were directed against HIV-1 LAV in Philadelphia, Ribeirao Preto and Marseille, and against HIV-1 NDK in Kinshasa. However, some sera with an HIV-1 NDK type-specific neutralization pattern were also found in Philadelphia, Ribeirao Preto and Marseille. These results indicate that strains with an HIV-1 NDK-like serotype could be found outside Africa. The presence of type-specific neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 NDK in sera from North and South America and Europe should be taken into account during attempts to serotype HIV as well as in the course of selection of HIV-1 candidate strains for an AIDS vaccine."

Twenty-nine unselected patients not treated with immunoprophylaxis formed group 1 and were compared to a recent consecutive series of 27 patients (group 2) in whom pre-transplant serological status was determined and who received immunoprophylaxis. One-year actuarial HBsAg serological recurrence rates were 48% in group 2 and 90% in group 1 with particular improvement in recipients who were either HBV DNA-negative or who had co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection. One-year patient survival has improved from 62% in group 1 to 86% in group 2 with improvements in hepatitis delta virus-negative and replicating recipients. Patients who have either co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection or are in group 2 have 1-year survival rates comparable to elective HBsAg-negative recipients (19/21 (90%), 22/27 (86%) vs 87%, respectively). In the event of recurrence, severe graft injury is diminished in recent patients and in those with coexistent delta infection who also have lower levels of circulating HBV DNA. Retransplantation for associated graft injury has a poor prognosis irrespective of administration of immunoprophylaxis. In elective liver recipients, immunoprophylaxis and/or hepatitis delta virus infection modulate hepatitis B virus recurrence and associated graft injury with consequent improvement in patient survival."

2586,0.01,2.0000,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."

The current study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and its associated risk factors among hemodialysis patients from five hemodialysis centers in Tabriz, a Northwestern Iranian city. Hepatitis B serologic markers were evaluated in chronic hemodialysis patients. Patients (n = 412) were divided into two groups: Group 1--patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Group 2--patients with negative HBsAg. The median age was 54.9 years (range, 13-90 years). Thirteen patients (3.2%) were found to be positive for HBsAg. Among the studied factors, the history of war injury was significantly associated with the risk of HBV infection (P = 0.023). In conclusion, our study shows that the risk of HBV infection among Tabrizian hemodialysis patients is a factor of dialysis-independent parameters."
5064,0.01,2.0000,"The clinical symptoms of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include severe liver damage, which is associated with the elimination of the HBV‑infected cells by the immune system. It has been suggested that suppression of HBV replication is not sufficient for patients with hepatitis B and the damaged liver function requires restoration. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined with short hairpin (sh)RNA to treat liver injury and suppress HBV replication in a mouse model. Lx‑shRNA157‑1694 (an shRNA expression plasmid containing two shRNA expression cassettes) and mouse immortal (mi)MSCs stably expressing shRNA (miMSC‑shRNA) were constructed and their suppressive effects on HBV expression were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR), ELISA and immunofluorescence. Hepatogenic differentiation of miMSC‑shRNA was induced in vitro and confirmed by morphology, reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative and ‑quantitative PCR, urea production and Periodic acid‑Schiff staining analyses. miMSCs and the shRNA expression plasmid alone or combined with miMSCs stably expressing shRNA were injected into mice. The former therapeutic regimen successfully suppressed HBV expression in sera and liver tissue, whereas the latter only suppressed HBV expression in liver tissue. Analyses of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, liver weight/body weight ratio percentage and sirius red staining demonstrated marked amelioration of liver injury in mice treated with both therapeutic regimens. The results of the present study suggest that miMSCs combined with shRNA treatment may alleviate liver injury and suppress HBV expression, thus providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver injury induced by HBV infection."

Under this policy, every human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected person should be initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We compared intra- and inter-group viral suppression and ART adherence rates for pre-UTT (initiated on ART in March-August 2016) and UTT groups (initiated in September 2016). The study was conducted in a community outreach Program in Nairobi with 3500 HIV-infected children enrolled."
3809,0.01,2.0000,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."

Infection, formation of cell monolayers, and enumeration of plaques all took place in 96-well microtiter plates. When this process was preceded by 18 h of incubation of HIV with patient serum samples, neutralizing antibody titers between 1:10 and 1:5,000 could be accurately determined in patient serum samples. In addition to the determination of neutralizing antibody titers (with the use of various serum dilutions and a constant virus concentration), neutralization indices could also be determined with different virus dilutions and a single dilution of patient serum."

Adherence, psychosocial and other supportive services have been combined into Wellness Programmes that have been situated within hospital-based Wellness Centres in two rural regions, and integrated within primary healthcare facilities in a third. This paper reviews components of wellness services for people living with HIV/AIDS including: voluntary counselling and testing, disclosure and prevention, ongoing counselling, health literacy and peer education, community- and home-based care, adherence support, and associated comprehensive care continuums. It also describes local context in which the Wellness Programmes were established. Finally it describes processes, successes and challenges, with programme development, and useful indicators monitored, lessons learned and strategies to strengthen and expand such programmes. Insights provided may inform other efforts to create sustainable systems of interdisciplinary care and accessible psychosocial support for HIV-infected persons within public facilities in resource-constrained settings."

1548,0.01,2.0000,"We sought to determine tuberculosis (TB) prevalence including multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB among a cohort of high risk patients at two directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) clinics in Delhi, India. We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."
5673,0.01,2.0000,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
2464,0.01,2.0000,"Since 2001, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) has been available in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
9732,0.01,2.0000,"A decade has passed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as standard of care for HIV/AIDS patients. The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."
6474,0.01,2.0000,"Data for this study were obtained from 2375 tuberculosis (TB) patients registered during 2007-2009 and 43 health providers to examine the trend of TB patient referral for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) testing and to investigate provider-associated barriers to the referral in Prey Kabas operational district, Takeo province, Cambodia. Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "
1159,0.01,2.0000,"Rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can result in improved patient care and/or faster implementation of public health preventive measures. A new rapid test, Determine (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.), detects HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies within 15 min by using 50 microl of serum or plasma. No specialized equipment or ancillary supplies are required, and results are read visually. A positive result is noted by the appearance of a red line. An operational control (red line) indicates proper test performance. We evaluated the Determine rapid HIV detection test with a group of well-characterized serum samples (CD4 counts and viral loads were known) and serum samples from HIV-positive individuals at field sites in Honduras and the Dominican Republic. In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), while 27 patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm(3). Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873,746 log(10) copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100% (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100% (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples. The Determine test was simple to perform and the results were easy to interpret. The Determine test provides a valuable new method for the rapid identification of HIV-positive individuals, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory infrastructures."

5150,0.01,2.0000,"People with HIV and AIDS are living much longer today, thanks to a better understanding of the disease process and the development of effective antiviral drugs and multidrug therapies. Consequently, HIV is now considered a chronic disease, one that affects nearly 40 million people worldwide. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), first instituted in 1996, has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of perinatally infected children; however, in 2004, there were still 640,000 children under the age of 15 living with HIV worldwide.1 This population of patients faces more mature health issues compared to most children their age. For example, rampant dental decay is common among children with HIV and requires advanced treatment planning that needs to be closely coordinated with members of the medical team. Maintaining good oral health in combination with medication compliance leads to sustained overall health in HIV-infected children; however, many of the medications these children take have severe adverse effects on their oral health. Furthermore, these medications may interfere with other medications that are prescribed or administered in connection with oral health care. Lastly, the systemic and oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS are different for children than they are for adults; as a result, the prognosis and treatment options for these manifestations vary, depending on the patient's age. This article will address factors that affect the oral health of HIV-infected children and adults, as well as common oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS. Key differences in treatment planning for HIV-infected children and HIV-infected adults will be outlined."
9566,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a major threat to the survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in areas where antiretroviral therapy is available. In coinfection, viral eradication has been difficult to attain, and HCV therapy is underused. Novel therapies may be particularly beneficial for this population, yet studies lag behind those for HCV monoinfection. Increasingly, incident HCV among HIV-infected men who have sex with men is associated with sexual risk behavior further research should be performed to refine understanding of the causal mechanism of this association. The phenomenon of aggressive hepatic fibrogenesis when HIV infection precedes HCV acquisition requires longer-term observation to ensure optimal timing of HCV therapy. Medical management in coinfection will be improved by enhancing HCV detection, with annual serologic testing, screening with HCV RNA to detect acute infection, and HIV testing of HCV-infected individuals; by addressing HCV earlier in coinfected persons; and by universal consideration for HCV therapy. HCV drug trials in individuals coinfected with HIV should be expedited. HIV/HCV coinfection remains a growing and evolving epidemic; new developments in therapeutics and improved care models offer promise."
4642,0.01,2.0000,"A nationwide hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program for neonates was launched in Iran in 1993. Despite the success of this program, concern about its long-term success still remains, because breakthrough infections due to emergence of surface mutants have been reported in immunized children. We aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HBV and vaccine escape mutants among individuals born after the initiation of the nationwide vaccination program in Iran. This study included 1115 participants younger than 23 years old, with 223 in each age cohort. The presence of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc was evaluated using an ELISA kit. HBV-DNA levels were measured in anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive subjects. PCR products were sequenced and mutations were identified. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.27 %. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive rates were 48 % and 0.18 %, respectively. Two individuals were positive for anti-HBc, one of whom was also positive for HBsAg, and the other was positive for anti-HBc only. HBV DNA was detected in three out of four anti-HBc-and /or HBsAg-positive subjects. An I195M mutation within the S gene was detected in two of the three HBV-DNA-positive cases. A very low prevalence of HBsAg and isolated anti-HBc were found in this study. The I195M mutation found in the surface gene could have been induced by immune pressure. Although the number of ''vaccine escape'' mutants found in this cohort was low, ongoing surveillance of breakthrough infections and escape mutants is still needed."
2954,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
7434,0.01,2.0000,"Around 5-10% of adults infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic liver disease such as chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and it is unclear whether the clinical outcome depends solely on the immune response or whether viral factors also play a role. In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."
9525,0.01,2.0000,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most prevalent AIDS-associated tumour, occurring in 20-30% of HIV-1-infected individuals in the early 1980s. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease and might therefore support the concept of 'opportunistic malignancies' requiring immune impairments to occur. The relationship between the immune system and the epidemiology of this virus-induced tumour is of importance in order to identify new therapeutic approaches for treating or preventing its occurrence. As a model of impaired angiogenesis, therapeutic options for treating AIDS patients with KS should therefore target cell division, anti-angiogenic processes, immune modulators, cytokines and potentially antiviral drugs."
6910,0.01,2.0000,"HBeAg seropositivity is a marker for active viral replication. In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection, HBeAg marks the first two of the four phases, namely the immune tolerant phase and the immune clearance phase, and is associated with highly replicative activity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Most HBV consensus reports and guidelines recommend antiviral therapy if the immune clearance phase is prolonged and if there is evidence of significant necroinflammation and fibrosis. Two main types of antiviral agents have been approved for treating patients in the immune clearance phase: interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). The endpoints of therapy are viral suppression with HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable serum HBV DNA, normalization of serum alanine transaminase and improvement in the histological necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores. The ultimate goal of therapy is to obtain clinical benefit for the patient by reducing complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The choice between interferon-based immune modulators or NUCs that target the HBV DNA polymerase must be carefully weighed on an individual basis. Therapy with NUCs is often preferred by doctors and patients because it is easy to administer, with predictable efficacy and minimal side-effects. In specific patient subgroups such as those with decompensated disease, poor predictors of response or lack of response to interferon-based therapy and/or significant comorbidities that cannot tolerate interferon-induced side effects, NUCs therapy is the obvious choice. Entecavir and tenofovir are the treatments of choice because their efficacy and safety profile are better than lamivudine, adefovir and telbivudine. More importantly, there is a minimal risk of drug resistance during long-term therapy with these agents."
9585,0.01,2.0000,"Approximately 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), representing a significant public health challenge. Nucleos/tide analogues (NUCs) and interferon alpha (IFNα), the current standard of care for chronic infection, aim at preventing progression of the disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. However, in contrast to the case of hepatitis C virus infection, in which novel antiviral drugs cure the vast majority of treated patients, in regard to HBV, cure is rare due to the unusual persistence of viral DNA in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of infected cells. Available therapies for HBV require lifelong treatment and surveillance, as reactivation frequently occurs following medication cessation and the occurrence of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, even after years of successful viral suppression. Progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics, and it is likely that only a combination of immune modulators, inhibitors of gene expression and replication and cccDNA-targeting drugs will eradicate chronic infection. This review aims to summarize the state of the art in HBV drug research highlighting those agents with the greatest potential for success based on in vitro as well as on data from clinical studies."
6274,0.01,2.0000,"The social stigma in patients with hepatitis B virus infection has caused several complications for both the patients and the associated medical system. This study aimed at demonstrating the social stigma experienced by these patients in Iran. This is a qualitative study using a content analysis approach with references to primary and secondary sources. The data were collected through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews conducted in 2014. By analyzing the data, two main themes were noted: extrinsic concepts of social stigma (causing reprehension, embarrassment, and discrimination) and intrinsic concepts of social stigma (sense of rejection, isolation, and frustration). The analysis of participants' experiences showed that social stigma is a simple lack of knowledge among the patients and society and it is more intense in the first days after the diagnosis. Stigma is prevalent among patients with hepatitis B virus, causes them to hide the disease, and provokes various complications for them as well as society. This study emphasizes the necessity of implementing health education programs about hepatitis B and its associated stigma, especially considering the potential impact of a mass media campaign."
6574,0.01,2.0000,"HIV and poor mental health are intricately related. In settings of poverty, both are often rooted in structural factors related to material and social deprivation. We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation."

This study aimed to characterize patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in a reference centre for cases involving complications or drug resistance in TB. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%).

We aimed to describe the hospital-level disease burden and factors contributing to morbidity and mortality among hospitalized HIV-positive patients in the era of widespread ART availability. Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."
7859,0.01,2.0000,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target of treating 3 million people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) by 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients could significantly contribute to this target. ART (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) was initiated in Thyolo district, Malawi, in April 2003, and all HIV-positive TB patients were considered eligible and offered ART. Despite this, only 44 (13%) of 352 TB patients were eventually started on ART by the end of November 2003. Most TB patients leave hospital after 2 weeks to complete the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (rifampicin-based) in the community, and ART is offered to HIV-positive TB patients after they have started the continuation phase of treatment (isoniazid/ ethambutol). ART is only offered at hospital, while the majority of TB patients take their continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment from health centres. HIV-positive TB patients therefore find it difficult to access ART. In this paper, we discuss a series of options to increase the uptake of ART among HIV-positive TB patients. The main options are: 1) to hospitalise HIV-positive TB patients with a view to starting ART in the continuation phase in hospital; 2) to decentralise ART delivery so ART can be delivered at health centres; 3) to replace nevirapine with efavirenz so ART can be started earlier in the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Decentralisation of ART from hospitals to health centres would greatly improve ART access."
8048,0.01,2.0000,"Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 represents a major problem in many regions of the world, especially Southern Africa. With the exception of viral and proviral load, the role for maternal cofactors in perinatal transmission outcome is largely unknown. In this study, an assessment was made of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene-expression profiles to better understand transcriptional changes associated with HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission among young adult mothers with infants in Botswana. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens were used from 25 HIV+ drug naive and 20 HIV- healthy mothers, similar in age and location, collected in 1999-2000 and 2003, and processed with the exact same methods, as previously described. Expression profiling of 22 277 microarray gene probes implicated a broad initiation of innate response gene-sets, including toll-like receptor, interferon-stimulated and antiviral RNA response pathways in association with maternal HIV-1 infection. Maternal transmission status was further associated with host genes that influence RNA processing and splicing patterns. In addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of specific genes, enriched category validation of PBMC profiles was conducted using two independent data sets for either HIV-1 infection or an unrelated RNA virus, severe acute respiratory virus infection. HIV-1 pathogen-specific host profiles should prove a useful tool in infection and transmission intervention efforts worldwide."
4368,0.01,2.0000,"We previously reported that inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal function can dramatically enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity, suggesting that under these conditions productive HIV-1 infection can occur via the endocytic pathway. Here we further examined this effect with bafilomycin A1 (BFLA-1) and show that this enhancement of infectivity extends to all HIV-1 isolates tested regardless of coreceptor usage. However, isolate-specific differences were observed in the magnitude of the effect. This was particularly evident in the case of the weakly infectious HIV-1(SF2), for which we observed the greatest enhancement. Using reciprocal chimeric viruses, we were able to determine that both the disproportionate increase in the infectivity of HIV-1(SF2) in response to BFLA-1 and its weak infectivity in the absence of BFLA-1 mapped to its envelope gene. Further, we found HIV-1(SF2) to have lower fusion activity and to be 12-fold more sensitive to the fusion inhibitor T-20 than HIV-1(NL4-3). Proteasomal inhibitors also enhance HIV-1 infectivity, and we report that the combination of a lysosomal and a proteasomal inhibitor greatly enhanced infectivity of all isolates tested. Again, HIV-1(SF2) was unique in exhibiting a synergistic 400-fold increase in infectivity. We also determined that inhibition of proteasomal function increased the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The evidence presented here highlights the important role of the lysosomes/proteasomes in the destruction of infectious HIV-1(SF2) and could have implications for the development of novel antiviral agents that might take advantage of these innate defenses."
8992,0.01,2.0000,"A sensitive and accurate tuberculosis (TB) serodiagnostic test would aid in the control of TB, but results of current tests are relatively unreliable for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated a new prototype immunochromatographic strip test and 5 commercially available serodiagnostic TB tests in a prospective study comprised of 465 consecutively enrolled patients with suspected TB from 2 hospitals in Botswana. Consenting adults underwent HIV testing, >/=2 sputum smears and cultures, and mycobacterial blood culture. Patients were defined as having TB on the basis of any positive smear or culture. Between January and September 2002, 465 of 498 consecutive patients consented to enrollment. A total of 384 patients (83%) were infected with HIV, and 175 (38%) had TB; the mycobacterial blood culture was the sole source of diagnosis for 26 patients (15%) with TB. Among the tests evaluated, the sensitivity was 0%-63%, the specificity was 39%-99%, the positive predictive value was 0%-39%, and the negative predictive value was 63%-65%. We conclude that the serodiagnostic tests evaluated in this study lacked sufficient sensitivity as sole tests for TB in this population."
3524,0.01,2.0000,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
8908,0.01,2.0000,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

2753,0.01,2.0000,"Individuals in Tanzania who have limited access to medical and dental treatment provide an opportunity to study the natural association between periodontal condition and HIV infection and the stage of infection. 119 HIV-infected adult individuals and 73 individuals with AIDS from the AIDS Clinical Trial Clinic at Muhimbili Medical Centre (MMC) in Dar-es-Salaam participated as cases. Mean age was 35.3 and 35.1 years, respectively. 156 individuals with a mean age of 28.3 years, confirmed as HIV-seronegative, served as controls. There were no significant differences in bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss among the HIV-seronegative individuals, HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients. We applied multiple logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for presence of periodontal conditions adjusting for age, gender and DMFT. Our odds ratios did not reveal any significant associations between bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss with regard to lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts among the HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. When associations were investigated with regard to HIV-serostatus (HIV-seronegative, HIV-seropositive or AIDS), our adjusted odds ratios were insignificant, too. In fact, most odds ratios were close to 1. Thus, our study supports recent views that the presence, extent and severity of periodontal disease among HIV-infected individuals, may be less that hitherto thought."
7777,0.01,2.0000,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."

3662,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."

5259,0.01,2.0000,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains prevalent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Memory function is commonly affected. There is a need for a rapid, but sensitive screening tool. This study compares the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and a computerised battery cognitive assessment to establish if the questionnaire has potential as a rapid screening tool for HIV-associated NCI. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with an undetectable HIV viral load on stable HAART were eligible to participate. Asymptomatic NCI (aNCI) was defined as a performance score more than 1SD below the normative mean in at least two domains of the computerised test. Memory impairment (MI) was defined as a t-score more than 1 SD below the normative mean using the PRMQ. Forty-five subjects participated. The mean age was 48 years (SD 11), the mean CD4 count was 546 cells/mul (SD 271), and 84% were male. Of subjects, 14/45 (24%) had NCI and 15/45 (33%) had MI. Two subjects had both types of impairment. No significant association was found between the presence of aNCI and MI (p = 0.229, r = 0.18, 95% CI -1.2, 0.23). aNCI was statistically significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.38, r = 0.31, 95% CI -0.02, 0.001). MI was statistically significantly associated with the set-shifting cognitive domain of the computerized battery (p = 0.04, r = 0.326) and time elapsed since HIV diagnosis (p = 0.035, r = 0.316). High rates of asymptomatic NCI were observed in this cohort, especially in younger individuals. The memory questionnaire did not reliably identify HIV-associated NCI other than executive function deficits and based on our data should therefore not be used as a rapid screening tool for this purpose."
3316,0.01,2.0000,"This study investigates factors associated with the self-reported use of complementary therapies, types of therapies used, and sources of complementary therapy information among HIV-positive patients attending a public, HIV outpatient clinic in New Orleans. A convenience sample of 287 clients (220 men and 67 women) was given a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Overall, complementary therapy use was 31%. Patients who used complementary therapy were more likely to be white (O.R., 2.5), female (O.R. 3.3), a high school graduate (O.R. 2.9), and to know another complementary therapy user (O.R. 7.8). Age, sexual orientation, CD4 cell count, injection drug use, living with another HIV-infected person, having pain, and HIV support group membership were not associated. Men were more likely than women, and whites were more likely than nonwhites, to use vitamins/minerals, imagery/meditation, and dietary regimens. Nonwhites were more likely than whites, and women more likely than men, to use spiritual healing. Of those using complementary therapy, men were more likely than women, and whites more likely than nonwhites, to get information about complementary therapy from HIV organizations, friends, and homosexual-oriented media. Doctors and nurses were the most frequently cited source of complementary therapy information for women. Frequency, type of therapies used, and source of information about complementary therapy among HIV-infected persons vary by race and gender. Clinicians should be educated about complementary therapies so that they can provide information to their patients and be aware of self-treatment behavior."

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
28,0.01,2.0000,"The incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been declining thanks to the universal hepatitis B infant immunization program. Nevertheless, young adults born before the program implementation might have acquired HBV in early childhood or remain susceptible to infection. This study aimed to evaluate hepatitis B epidemiology in asymptomatic young adult population in Ternate, eastern Indonesia. Serum samples of 376 subjects (aged 17-25, mean 19.82 ± 1.69 years; male/female 138/238) were screened for HBV parameters serologically (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]; its antibody [anti-HBs]; anti-core antigen [anti-HBc]), and molecularly (HBV DNA). HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA prevalence were 15.7%, 36.2%, 24.2%, and 27.9%, respectively, with male predominance. Of all subjects, 13.0% were HBsAg negative with detectable HBV DNA (occult hepatitis B [OHB]), and 56.4% showed negativity for all seromarkers. This population showed high hepatitis B prevalence with substantial occurrence of OHB. However, a high percentage of the population were still susceptible and at risk of HBV infection. This study emphasizes the necessity to improve prevention strategies to screen and manage HBV carriers, including the adoption of catch-up or booster vaccination targeted to young adult populations. Investigations on the roles of host-virus interactions associated with OHB and its implications are warranted. "
7640,0.01,2.0000,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."

However, the region's health system capacity to effectively identify and treat depression is limited. Task-shifting models may help address this large mental health treatment gap. Measurement-Based Care (MBC) is a task-shifting model in which a Depression Care Manager guides a non-psychiatric (e.g., HIV) provider in prescribing and managing antidepressant treatment. We adapted MBC for depressed HIV-infected patients in Cameroon and completed a pilot study to assess feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. We enrolled 55 participants; all started amitriptyline 25-50 mg daily at baseline. By 12 weeks, most remained at 50 mg daily (range 25-125 mg). Median (interquartile range) PHQ-9 depressive severity scores declined from 13 (12-16) (baseline) to 2 (0-3) (week 12); 87 % achieved depression remission (PHQ-9 <5) by 12 weeks. Intervention fidelity was high: HIV providers followed MBC recommendations at 96 % of encounters. Most divergences reflected a failure to increase dose when indicated. No serious and few bothersome side effects were reported. Most suicidality (prevalence 62 % at baseline; 8 % at 12 weeks) was either passive or low-risk. Participant satisfaction was high (100 %), and most participants (89 %) indicated willingness to pay for medications if MBC were implemented in routine care. The adapted MBC intervention demonstrated high feasibility, safety, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in this uncontrolled pilot study. Further research should assess whether MBC could improve adherence and HIV outcomes in this setting. "

When open fractures were considered separately, the seropositive group had a 55.6% infection rate compared with 11.3% in the seronegative group (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.004). Similarly, seropositive patients also had significantly increased rates of postoperative non-wound infections and complications (Chi-square p < 0.001). Asymptomatic HIV-seropositive orthopedic trauma patients are at significantly higher risk for postoperative infections than their seronegative counterparts. For HIV-seropositive patients with open fractures, this risk is especially pronounced."

The authors found that HIV incidence was low at both sites: 0.8/100 person-years at the Harlem site and 0/100 person-years at the Lower East Side site. In contrast, HBV incidence was moderate (12.2/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (30.7/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Similarly, HCV incidence was moderate (9.3/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (34.0/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Results show that high rates of HBV and HCV transmission do not imply high rates of HIV transmission, even within an area of high HIV seroprevalence."
2958,0.01,2.0000,"The life expectancy of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission has important clinical and public health significance. Several sources of population-based surveillance data from New York City, covering 1982 through the end of 1994, were combined to estimate long-term survival of HIV-infected children and age-specific prevalence. HIV incidence among newborns was estimated by applying expected transmission rates to seroprevalence surveys of parturient women and by using back-calculation methods. HIV prevalence in childhood was based on cumulative HIV incidence and cumulative mortality, adjusting for underreporting of death and background causes of death. A modified actuarial method was developed to estimate survival of infected children. At the beginning of 1995, between 1,945 and 3,323 children less than age 13 years were estimated to be living with HIV infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission in New York City. Between 36% and 61% of these infected children were estimated to survive to age 13 years (median survival, 8.6 years to >13 years). A substantial proportion of infected children will survive to adolescence. Thus, it is important that their educational, medical, and other needs be considered. These methods may be useful in other areas in which HIV seroprevalence data among childbearing women and HIV mortality statistics are available."
5531,0.01,2.0000,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."

In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."
3666,0.01,2.0000,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."

A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05).

7267,0.01,2.0000,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."

The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."

Our study aimed to characterize HBV full-length genome quasispecies (QS) in patients with different phases of infection to better understand its pathogenesis. Forty treatment-naive HBV-infected patients were enrolled, including 10 cases of acute hepatitis B (AHB), 9 cases of immunotolerant (IT) HBV carriers, 11 cases of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 10 cases of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). The present study was conducted by clone-based sequencing. QS heterogeneity within each open reading frame was calculated. The mutation frequency index (MFI) and amino acid variations within the large HBsAg, HBcAg, and HBxAg regions were analyzed based on the different infection phases. In total, 606 HBV full-length sequences were obtained. HBV QS had higher heterogeneity in ACLF and CHB than that in IT among chronically infected individuals. AHB patients had the lower QS heterogeneity at onset than those with chronic infection. ACLF patients had the highest frequency of mutations in the core promoter and precore region. A triple mutation (A1762T/G1764A/G1896A) was observed more frequently in genotype C than in genotype B. The MFI indicated that specific peptides of the studied regions had more frequent mutations in ACLF. Furthermore, several amino acid variations, known as T- and B-cell epitopes, were potentially associated with the immunoactive phase of infection. More HBV genome mutations and deletions were observed in patients with more severe diseases, particularly in specific regions of the core and preS regions, the clinical significance and mechanism of which need to be further investigated.

During 2001-2006, 36 cases of tuberculosis (TB) was recognized in 33 patients infected with HIV. The majority of patients were men infected with HIV in through intravenous drug using and had a CD4 cell count <200cells/microl at the time of TB diagnosis. The most frequent form of TB was pulmonary localization and lymphadenitis as extrapulmonary localization. Meningitis was recognized in two cases. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive culture for mycobacteria and PCR in 34/36 patients. Mycobacterial smears were positive in 2/36 cases, the skin test reaction with nodule >5mm was positive in 60% cases. Immune reconstruction syndrome was recognized in 4 patients."

This is a prospective observational cohort of 700 HIV-infected patients enrolled between March 2004 and June 2006 in four U.S. cities, who completed a confidential audio computer-assisted self-interview [ACASI] with behavioral risk and health-related questions at baseline and 6-month follow-up visits, including the nine-question PRIME-MD depression screener and a validated 3-day antiretroviral adherence question. Among 539 eligible participants receiving HAART, 14% had depression at baseline (22% women, 12% men). In multivariable analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for repeated measurements through 24 months of follow-up, persons who reported depression on a given ACASI were twice as likely to report nonadherence to antiretrovirals on the same ACASI (Odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.57] for mild/moderate depression versus none); such persons were also less likely to have HIV viral load<400 copies/mL. Self-administered computerized standardized screening tools can identify at-risk individuals with depression who may benefit from interventions to improve antiretroviral adherence."
2728,0.01,2.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
5795,0.01,2.0000,"The aim of this study was to monitor the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in Denmark. In addition we assessed the prevalence of non-B subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. Plasma samples from 104 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were obtained in the year 2000. The entire protease gene and 320 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene were genotyped. Sequences were obtained from 97 patients. No subjects displayed primary resistance mutations in the protease gene, whereas all carried 1 or more secondary mutations. Resistance mutations in the RT-gene associated with NRTI-resistance were found in 1 patient, who was infected with zidovudine resistant HIV-1 harbouring the M41L mutation in combination with T215S and L210S. The T215S mutation has been showed to be associated with reversion of zidovudine resistance. The T215S mutation was found in 1 additional patient. The subtype distribution was subtype B 59%, C 18%, A 8%, CRF02_AG 5%, CRF01_AE 4%, D 3% and G 2%. We found 2 patients (2%) with mutations associated with resistance in the RT-gene and none in the protease gene indicating a low prevalence of resistant HIV-1 in Denmark in the year 2000."
6451,0.01,2.0000,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
1209,0.01,2.0000,"Because of widely differing reports on the significance of IgM anti-HBc in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, paired sera and liver biopsies from 49 patients with chronic HBV infection were analysed for serum IgM anti-HBc, HBsAg titre, HBeAg/anti-HBe, HBV DNA, serum aspartate transaminase, intrahepatic HBcAg expression, and liver histology. High levels of IgM anti-HBc, in the diagnostic range of acute hepatitis B (greater than 1.2), were detected in seven patients (14.3%) and a total of 34 patients (69.6%) had an index of more than 0.2. No correlation was found between IgM anti-HBc and the serum markers of active viral replication or HBsAg titre but it correlated significantly with intrahepatic expression of cytoplasmic HBcAg (r2 = 0.165, P = 0.002). IgM anti-HBc also correlated with active liver histology (P = 0.015) but there was a considerable overlap of the IgM anti-HBc index values between the various disease groups, indicating a poor specificity. Serial assessment of IgM anti-HBc in eight patients treated with interferon-alpha (four responders) showed an increase in IgM anti-HBc in three out of four patients corresponding to the e-seroconversion period followed by a drop in IgM anti-HBc levels. However, an increase in IgM anti-HBc was also seen in one non-responder, indicating that this feature is not unique to interferon-alpha responders. These data indicate that serum IgM anti-HBc cannot be used alone as a certain diagnostic measure of HBV replication nor in the prediction of liver histology."

This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection amongst medical students of the Lagos State University College of Medicine, Ikeja, Nigeria. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire and through blood analysis for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBeAg) as well as antibodies to the core (anti-HBc), surface (anti-HBs) and 'e' (anti-HBe) antigens. Three hundred and thirteen of 325 students (96%) participated. The mean age was 24.3+/-3.98 years; 231 (74%) were pre-clinical students and 82 (26%) were in the clinical years of study. Only 8 (2.6%) had received three doses of vaccination against HBV. Eighty-one (26%) tested positive for anti-HBc, 10 (3.2%) were positive for HBsAg and 56 (17.9%) had anti-HBs antibodies. A significant relationship was found between students who had a positive history of hepatitis B in the family and anti-HBc (P=0.03). Age was also significantly associated with HBsAg (P=0.012). Two hundred and twenty-five (72%) students were susceptible to the infection and required vaccination. Most students at this medical school are susceptible to HBV infection and should be vaccinated."
8027,0.01,2.0000,"Parasitic infections continue to take their toll on HIV positive patients by influencing the blood qualitatively and quantitatively. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."
6196,0.01,2.0000,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality from sequelae of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past decades, better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection and of the development of many powerful antiviral agents has allowed us to improve therapeutic efficacy. Among these agents, nucleos(t)ide analogs are important and potent viral suppressors. However, when administered alone, they are not able to permanently eradicate HBV, and long-term maintenance therapy is required for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, prolonged treatment is frequently associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Before an 'ideal' drug(s), or drug combination, with optimal antiviral efficacy and negligible rates of drug resistance becomes available, the on-treatment monitoring approach using serum HBV DNA level as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy and drug resistance is useful. However, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have low income economies, insufficient medical care systems, and low awareness of the disease among the general population and government officers. The easy approach of the road-map concept using an affordable drug to treat chronic HBV infection is more important in this region. There is already evidence that the long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection can be improved under well-managed antiviral therapy. Profound and long-lasting suppression of HBV replication, either maintained on-therapy or sustained after stopping therapy, has been identified as the key determinant for achieving the goals of therapy, for reducing liver damage, and for preventing development of cirrhosis and/ or hepatocellular carcinoma."
3870,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proved effective in prolonging survival and improving the quality of life of the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). For the successful treatment of HIV infection, at least 95% adherence to HAART is required. This study sought to assess adherence to HAART and to identify factors enhancing adherence within the study population. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 428 patients attending the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic of the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi. Self-reported adherence and other data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 and Epi6; and were exported into Systat 11 for multivariate logistic regression. There were 151 (35.3%) males and 277 (64.7%) females. The mean age was 36.7 +/- 9.6 years. Self-reported adherence rate was 268 (62.6%). The factor most predictive of adherence to HAART was availability of ARVs [OR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval 3.1-8.6; p < 0.001], followed by the ability to afford regular visits to the ARV clinic [OR = 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.8; p = 0.034]. A recent diagnosis of HIV made less than 3 years prior to the study period was also significantly associated with adherence to HAART (chi2 = 8.94; p = 0.003). Availability of ARVs and ability to afford to regularly visit the clinic among other factors, positively influenced adherence to HAART among PLWHA. Efforts should be targeted at constant provision of free ARVs and early initiation of therapy for those requiring treatment, as well as ensuring regular adherence-education."
1511,0.01,2.0000,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
1872,0.01,2.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."
3295,0.01,2.0000,"A significant proportion of those initiating antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV infection are lost to follow-up. Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."
3208,0.01,2.0000,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

Among HIV-infected youth, mean age of testing was 18.2 years. One third of the HIV-positive patients were female and four fifths were African-American or Hispanic. No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."
1773,0.01,2.0000,"Despite extensive evidence of cell signaling alterations induced by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vitro, the relevance of these changes to the clinical and/or immunologic status of HIV-1-infected individuals is often unclear. As such, mapping the details of cell type-specific degradation of immune function as a consequence of changes to signaling network responses has not been readily accessible. We used a flow cytometric-based assay of signaling to determine Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling changes at the single-cell level within distinct cell subsets from the primary immune cells of HIV-1-infected donors. We identified a specific defect in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-driven Stat5 phosphorylation in the monocytes of HIV-1+ donors. This inhibition was statistically significant in a cohort of treated and untreated individuals. Ex vivo Stat5 phosphorylation levels varied among HIV-1+ donors but did not correlate with CD4(+) T-cell counts or HIV-1 plasma viral load. Low Stat5 activation occurred in HIV-1-infected donors despite normal GM-CSF receptor levels. Investigation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, also stimulated by GM-CSF, led to the observation that lipopolysaccharide-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation is enhanced in monocytes. Thus, we have identified a specific, imbalanced monocyte signaling profile, with inhibition of STAT and enhancement of MAPK signaling, associated with HIV-1 infection. This understanding of altered monocyte signaling responses that contribute to defective antigen presentation during HIV-1 infection could lead to immunotherapeutic approaches that compensate for the deficiency."

Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."

The predominance of subtype C in the Indian subcontinent along with greater access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) necessitates studies on HIVDR genotyping. We determined the prevalence of mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) from plasma of 40 antiretroviral drug-naive study participants in Indian HIV-1 pol gene sequences. Of these, 36 sequences belonged to subtype C, two to subtype A1, and two were subtype A1C recombinants. The heterosexual route was the most common route of transmission. Drug resistance-associated mutations were observed in 10% (4/40) of the study participants. The resistance mutation observed in the protease gene was V82A, whereas in the RT gene, M41L, D67N, M184V, and A98G were documented.

1618,0.01,2.0000,"In September 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines calling for routine, voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing for all persons aged 13-64 years in health care settings. These guidelines were motivated, in part, by mounting evidence that the traditional approach of using risk factors to identify candidates for HIV testing is inadequate. Of the 1.0-1.2 million people in the United States thought to be infected with HIV, approximately 25% remain unaware of their infection, and nearly half of all infected patients develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome < or = 1 year after testing positive for HIV. Also contributing to the change in testing guidelines was recent evidence that routine HIV testing is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a method of assessing health care interventions in terms of the value they confer, reports results in terms of the resources that are required for the intervention to produce an additional unit of change in health effectiveness; more economically efficient programs are those with lower cost-effectiveness ratios. This article reviews the methods and results of cost-effectiveness studies in the United States and articulates why routine, voluntary HIV testing is not only of crucial public health importance but also economically justified."

Those with the joint effects of multiple sexual partners and a history of STD were the most likely to acknowledge their potential for HIV infection and have a behavioral basis for it. Sexual behaviors within this age group are highlighted and programmatic interventions are suggested.

In order to fully understand HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and related risk factors in this region, this study implemented in 2009, included a survey, physical examination, HIV and HCV test in two towns."
6475,0.01,2.0000,"Health care workers are exposed daily to blood borne injury and infection with a high risk of hepatitis B or C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In the 1980s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a set of protocols and guidelines known as standard precautions (SP) to prevent accidental transmission of pathogens. The SP should be followed for each intervention or delivery of care in order to protect health care workers from risks associated with contact with blood and other biological liquids. A survey was conducted in a Western Algerian university hospital to assess nurses' adherence to SP practices. A questionnaire was administered to 450 nurses in the hospital workplace setting. A field survey was also conducted in order to take into account the means and support available to the nurses in these hospital departments, namely to determine availability of hand washing and drying facilities. A total of 133 nurses, 81 women and 52 men, participated in the survey. Personal and professional data, hand-washing frequency, glove wearing practices were collected as data. A large majority (95%) of nurses reported washing their hands after removing their gloves, and 69% of them reported washing their hands between two patients. Male nurses wear gloves more often than females (respectively 77% and 53%). Sharp instruments were correctly disposed of in a puncture-resistant container more of the time. Recapping needles has been reported by two-thirds of survey respondents. Lack of liquid soap and alcohol-based washing solution were noted as major deficiencies as well as the lack of means to properly dry hands in many health care wards. Lack of SP adherence is primarily due to the lack of awareness and knowledge as well as insufficient supply of equipment and materials for good hand hygiene maintenance. This study highlights the urgent need to implement a programme to improve SP adherence among nurses and to increase the supply of hand washing and drying materials. Greater adherence to SP practices will also reduce the risk of occupational exposure to blood borne injury and infection."

We have studied ten subjects who have been asymptomatic with normal and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts, despite 12 to 16 years of HIV-1 infection, to gain information on the determinants of nonprogression. Multiple methods were used to determine the viral load in their blood. Plasma cultures were uniformly negative for infectious virus. However, particle-associated HIV-1 RNA was detectable in four subjects using a sensitive branched DNA amplification assay. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), infectious HIV-1 was quantified in three subjects using a standard limiting-dilution culture method. Infectious virus was recovered from another subject using a CD8-depleted culture. In contrast, six subjects had no detectable infectious virus in PBMC. All had detectable viral DNA in PBMC by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, but the copy numbers were low, ranging from 10 to 100 copies per 10(6) PBMC in all but two subjects. Overall, the viral burden in the plasma and PBMC of long-term survivors was orders of magnitude lower than those typically found in progressors. Possible mechanisms for low levels of HIV-1 in vivo were examined experimentally."
4732,0.01,2.0000,"Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV are very frequent. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates via reverse transcription like HIV. Structural similarities between the enzymatic pocket of the HBV DNA polymerase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are the basis that certain drugs inhibit both enzymes and thus the replication of both viruses. HBV components increase the pathogenic action of HIV and vice versa directly by certain proteins like HBsAg in the case of HBV and HIV-encoded Tat and Vpr and by disturbing the cytokine balance in affected cells. Antiretroviral therapy is highly beneficial for HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, but carries the risk of drug-induced resistance development and hepatotoxicity. Even with restoration of the immune capacity, signs of hepatic inflammation may develop even after 10 years of treatment."
1501,0.01,2.0000,"Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform."
487,0.01,2.0000,"Twenty cases of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in HIV-infected patients were reviewed over a 10-year-period, divided into Group A, including 13 NHL cases treated before the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, and Group B, including 7 patients who received HAART. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was performed and log-rank was applied to assess statistical differences between the groups. In group A, the median CD4 count was 36 cells/mm3. No complete remission was found. In group B, the median CD4 count was 137 cells/mm3. Four patients (57.0%) are still alive and in complete remission. Group A had a median survival of 5 months and group B 31 months (p = 0.0032). Our results are in agreement with recent reports in that a higher CD4 count and better immune status achieved with HAART is predictive of a better outcome. We found that HAART in combination with chemotherapy improves overall survival of NHL patients without increasing adverse effects."
2341,0.01,2.0000,"It is becoming increasingly important to identify and to study human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) with evidence of epidemic spread, since mosaic strains arise frequently, especially in populations where multiple subtypes cocirculate. We describe the almost complete nucleotide sequence of 3 subtype C and D recombinant viruses, selected from a pool of 13 D(gag)-D/C/D(env) perinatally infected infants from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All three genomes had cross-over points with approximately the same genomic localization. The subtype C-like sequences were located within pol, vif, vpr, vpu, the first exons of rev and tat, V3, and the U3-R regions of the LTR. Phylogenetic analyses of the full-length genomic sequences from these viruses showed the formation of a distinct subcluster on the HIV-1 subtype D branch. The pattern of recombination of genomes belonging to this new CRF, named CRF10_CD, might have resulted from independent recombination events occurring at high frequency or from a single source that originated earlier in this population. Future surveys will be needed to determine the potential of this CRF for epidemic spread."
1895,0.01,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in peripheral blood cells of HIV-1 infected individuals may be present as integrated and/or unintegrated DNA. Several reports have indicated that a major proportion of HIV-1 DNA in the asymptomatic phase is linear, full-length, and unintegrated and in the symptomatic phase either circular unintegrated or integrated in the host genome. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions, reflecting the presence of unintegrated single-LTR circles. In vitro infection of a CD4+ T-cell line resulted first in the increase of single-LTR junctions followed by syncytium formation and a rise of p24 antigen production. The number of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions was further studied in two acutely infected individuals and in 21 long-term infected individuals. The number of single-LTR junctions was significantly correlated with CD4+ cell decline, p24 antigen expression, and total HIV-1 DNA content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions were absent from PBMC containing other forms of HIV-1 DNA in four of nine non/slow progressors relative to 2 of 12 rapid progressors/AIDS patients. We conclude from our data that quantitative detection of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions can be used as an early DNA marker of the transition from clinical latency to active replication in the peripheral blood."
8668,0.01,2.0000,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
4966,0.01,2.0000,"In many urban areas of Central and Eastern Africa 20-30 per cent of the sexually active population has been infected with HIV. It can be assumed that every member of the operating dental staff in Tanzania frequently treats HIV-positive patients. The knowledge of AIDS and HIV infection was investigated by Tanzanian dental teams in 1988 and 1989. In both years almost one quarter of the dental officers and half the other operating team members chose incorrect information about the methods of transmission of HIV. Several respondents named health care workers as belonging to a high risk group. Fever and loss of weight were known to be early symptoms of AIDS. In 1989, when asked to identify oral manifestations of HIV, one quarter of all the dental staff could not mention any of them. The findings of the study emphasise the need for urgent further education of dental teams in Tanzania."
8661,0.01,2.0000,"Candida albicans has been shown to vary in its phenotypic expression with the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease and differentiated using two methods. The first utilized the morphological characteristics of colonies, and the second method utilized a small portion of C. albicans DNA as a probe on Southern-transferred, EcoRI-digested C. albicans genomic DNA. In 67% of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains varied considerably over the experimental period with one morphotype being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans persisted in the majority of HIV-infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A novel finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used."
2154,0.01,2.0000,"The pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) associated dementia in adults involves neuronal loss from discrete areas of the neocortex and subcortical regions, but the mechanism for neuronal death is poorly understood. Gene-directed cell death resulting in apoptosis is thought to be a normal feature of neuronal development, but little is known about neuronal apoptosis in disease states. We investigated whether HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system is spatially associated with apoptosis of neurons. Using an in situ technique to identify newly cleaved 3'-OH ends of DNA as a marker for apoptosis, we demonstrate the presence of apoptotic neurons in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of children that had HIV-1 encephalitis with progressive encephalopathy. Furthermore, an association was observed between the localization of apoptotic neurons and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates containing HIV-1 infected macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. Apoptotic neurons and p24-positive macrophages were observed infrequently in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia in children with HIV-1 infection without encephalitis or clinical encephalopathy. In nine control (HIV-1 negative) brains, ranging from the first post-natal month of life to 16.5 years of age, infrequent neuronal apoptosis was observed in three cases. These findings suggest that neuronal apoptosis is unlikely to be associated with post-natal development except in early post-natal germinal matrix, and that it may instead represent the end result of specific pathological processes, such as HIV-1 encephalitis."
5025,0.01,2.0000,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
688,0.01,2.0000,"Tat is a multifunctional transactivator encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Tat transactivating activity is controlled by nicotinamide adenine nucleotide(+) (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of nicotinamide into NAD(+), which is crucial for SIRT1 activation. Thus, the effect of Nampt on Tat-regulated SIRT activity was studied in Hela-CD4-beta-gal (MAGI) cells. We demonstrated that Tat caused NAD(+) depletion and inhibited Nampt mRNA and protein expression in MAGI cells. Resveratrol reversed Tat-induced NAD(+) depletion and inhibition of Nampt mRNA and protein expression. Further investigation revealed that Tat-induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity was potentiated in Nampt-knockdown by Nampt siRNA compared to treatment with Tat alone. Nampt siRNA potentiated Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation in MAGI cells. Altogether, these results indicate that Nampt is critical in the regulation of Tat-induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity and long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation. Nampt/SIRT1 pathway could be a novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
3388,0.01,2.0000,"Patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at high risk for gastrointestinal infections causing diarrhea, particularly when those infections are parasitic in nature. This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "
3792,0.01,2.0000,"To define the extent of sequence conservation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in vivo, the first 320 amino acids of RT obtained from 2,236 plasma-derived samples from a well-defined cohort of 1,704 HIV-1-infected individuals (457 drug naïve and 1,247 drug treated) were analyzed and examined in structural terms. In naïve patients, 233 out of these 320 residues (73%) were conserved (<1% variability). The majority of invariant amino acids clustered into defined regions comprising between 5 and 29 consecutive residues. Of the nine longest invariant regions identified, some contained residues and domains critical for enzyme stability and function. In patients treated with RT inhibitors, despite profound drug pressure and the appearance of mutations primarily associated with resistance, 202 amino acids (63%) remained highly conserved and appeared mostly distributed in regions of variable length. This finding suggests that participation of consecutive residues in structural domains is strictly required for cooperative functions and sustainability of HIV-1 RT activity. Besides confirming the conservation of amino acids that are already known to be important for catalytic activity, stability of the heterodimer interface, and/or primer/template binding, the other 62 new invariable residues are now identified and mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This new knowledge could be of help in the structure-based design of novel resistance-evading drugs."

We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."

1475,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

The finding of hepatic peliosis obtained in 4 patients was not associated with inflammatory liver changes, especially infections from Rochalimaea. Within a wide range of opportunistic infections recorded in 50 patients (22%), hepatitis caused by Cytomegalovirus (8%), Toxoplasma gondii (5%), Leishmania donovani (1%), Cryptococcus neoformans and Pneumocystis carinii (each 0.5%) was diagnosed.

Between April 1992 and December 2008, 350 patients underwent OLT, including 20 (5.7%) transplanted for HBV-HCV cirrhosis. We assessed patient and graft survivals at 1 and 5 years, as well as the progression of fibrosis. Protocol liver biopsies were available yearly after OLT. The survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier approach and chronic hepatitis evaluated according to the Ishak scoring system. At a median follow-up of 68.4 +/- 53 months, the 1- and 5-year patient and graft survival rates were 80% and 70%, respectively. The 5-year fibrosis progression rate was 0.17 +/- 0.08 units of fibrosis.

7731,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Due to its error-prone replication via reverse transcription, HBV can rapidly evolve variants that escape vaccination and/or become resistant to CHB treatment with nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs). This is particularly problematic for the first generation NAs lamivudine and adefovir. Though now superseded by more potent NAs, both are still widely used. Furthermore, resistance against the older NAs can contribute to cross-resistance against more advanced NAs. For lack of feasible HBV infection systems, the biology of such variants is not well understood. From the recent discovery of Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor new in vitro infection systems are emerging, yet access to the required large amounts of virions, in particular variants, remains a limiting factor. Stably HBV producing cell lines address both issues by allowing to study intracellular viral replication and as a permanent source of defined virions. Accordingly, we generated a panel of new tetracycline regulated TetOFF HepG2 hepatoma cell lines which produce six lamivudine and adefovir resistance-associated and two vaccine escape variants of HBV as well as the model virus woolly monkey HBV (WMHBV). The cell line-borne viruses reproduced the expected NA resistance profiles and all were equally sensitive against a non-NA drug. The new cell lines should be valuable to investigate under standardized conditions HBV resistance and cross-resistance. With titers of secreted virions reaching >3 x 10(7) viral genome equivalents per ml they should also facilitate exploitation of the new in vitro infection systems."

Of 101 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with </=100 CD4(+) lymphocytes per mm(3), 25 patients developed HCMV disease. The pp65 antigenemia assay (sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 89%) and DNA PCR of blood (sensitivity, 69%; specificity, 75%) were most accurate in predicting the development of HCMV disease within the next 12 months.

1113,0.01,2.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with marked disturbance of metabolism affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. In the first decade of clinical experience of HIV, the primary clinical manifestation of such disturbed metabolism was wasting. Such wasting was often severe and contributed significantly to the morbidity and mortality of AIDS. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that in addition to the effects of altered intermediary metabolism, reduced food intake played a major role in the causation of AIDS-related wasting. More recently, potent anti-retroviral drugs have dramatically changed the clinical consequences of HIV infection. Wasting has become far less frequent among infected patients and occurs in only a small percentage of subjects on effective anti-retroviral therapy. However, a new constellation of metabolic syndromes has become apparent characterized by altered body fat distribution ('lipodystrophy'), lactic acidosis and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. The mechanistic basis for such syndromes is currently unclear, but is the subject of ongoing research."

4892,0.01,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk of surgeons especially in developing countries where asymptomatic carrier rate is about 15%. Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
7070,0.01,2.0000,"For assessing the role of circulating immune complexes (CICs) in acute hepatitis B, CICs containing HBsAg, IgM, and IgG were determined, by C1q and conglutinin (K) assays, in 242 patients with acute hepatitis B and 60 healthy controls. CIC is a common feature of acute hepatitis B with 90.9% of cases having at least one abnormal test result. Patients with shorter interval (< 1 week) between onset of symptoms and patient presentation have significantly higher frequency of abnormal IgM class CIC, HBsAg-specific CIC, and higher frequency of raised alanine aminotransferase activity (> 30-fold upper limit of normal). The prevalence of raised alanine aminotransferase in patients with CIC containing HBsAg and IgM is higher than those without (P = 0.001). There is significant association between HBsAg-CIC and C1q-CIC. In conclusion, HBsAg-CIC and IgM class CIC correlate with disease activity. C1q-binding CIC is the predominant CIC that may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."

4981,0.01,2.0000,"Previous studies characterized the third variable (V3) loop of the envelope gp120 as the principal neutralizing determinant for laboratory T-cell-line-adapted (TCLA) strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, primary viruses isolated from infected individuals are more refractory to neutralization than TCLA strains, suggesting that qualitatively different neutralizing antibodies may be involved. In this study, we investigated whether the V3 loop constitutes a linear target epitope for antibodies neutralizing primary isolates. By using peptides representative of the V3 regions of various primary isolates, an early, relatively specific and persistent antibody response was detected in sera from HIV-infected patients. To assess the relationship between these antibodies and neutralization, the same peptides were used in competition and depletion experiments. Addition of homologous V3 peptides led to a competitive inhibition in the neutralization of the TCLA strain HIVMN/MT-4 but had no effect on the neutralization of the autologous primary isolate. Similarly, the removal of antibodies that bind to linear V3 epitopes resulted in a loss of HIVMN/MT-4 neutralization, whereas no decrease in the autologous neutralization was measured. The different roles of V3-specific antibodies according to the virus considered were thereby brought to light. This confirmed the involvement of V3 antibodies in the neutralization of a TCLA strain but emphasized a more pronounced contribution of either conformational epitopes or epitopes outside the V3 loop as targets for antibodies neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. This result underlines the need to focus on new vaccinal immunogens with epitopes able to induce broadly reactive and efficient antibodies that neutralize a wide range of primary HIV-1 isolates."
1676,0.01,2.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates via an error-prone reverse transcriptase generating potential drug-resistant quasispecies. The degree of HBV variability in liver vs peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients on long-term suppressive antivirals is unclear. We characterized HBV replication, drug resistance and molecular diversity in patients with plasma HBV DNA undetectable by clinical assays. Explant liver (n=9), PBMC (n=6) and plasma (n=7) from nine such patients undergoing liver transplantation were evaluated for HBV genomes by sensitive PCR/nucleic acid hybridization assay. Cases with HBV DNA in liver and PBMC were tested for covalently closed circular DNA (HBV cccDNA). HBV polymerase (P) amplicons were cloned, sequenced and both P and overlapping surface (S) gene sequences were analysed. HBV DNA was detected in 43% (3/7) of plasma, 100% (9/9) of liver and 83% (5/6) of PBMC samples. HBV cccDNA was detected in all liver and one PBMC sample. Four patients had a clinical diagnosis of resistance. HBV P gene sequencing revealed 100% wild type (wt) in plasma (2/2), 83% wt in PBMC (5/6) but livers of 3/9 (33%) contained wt and 6/9 (66%) carried resistance to lamivudine and/or adefovir. The translated S gene revealed no changes affecting HBV antigenicity. Sequences from livers with antiviral resistant mutants revealed greater interpatient quasispecies diversity. Despite apparent HBV suppression, the liver continues to support HBV replication and extrahepatic HBV can be detected. PBMC may be a sanctuary for wt virus during antiviral therapy, while the liver harbours more drug-resistant viruses. Drug resistance correlates with intrahepatic viral diversity."

Diarrhoeal specimens were inoculated onto standard culture media as well as onto Columbia and Campylobacter blood agar media for C. jejuni isolation. All the C. jejuni isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using Kirby-Bauer's method. A significant difference in recovery rates was observed between the 2 groups in relation to C. jejuni (p < or = 0.02; 95% CI 5.5 (1-10) and Shigella spp. (p < or = 0.02; 95% CI 6.5 (1-12). 21 isolates of Shigella spp., 16 C. jejuni, 5 Salmonella typhi, 3 Arcobacter spp., 3 Yersinia enterocolitica, and 2 Aeromonas hydrophila were recovered from the HIV infected cases. All the C. jejuni isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacin whereas 1 strain was resistant to nalidixic acid. Interestingly, all the 29 Shigella spp. (21 from HIV and 8 from non-HIV cases) were resistant to erythromycin and most were resistant to many other antibiotics used. Our observations underline the need for epidemiological investigations to screen C. jejuni and Shigella spp. in HIV infected subjects with diarrhoea and analyse their antibiograms periodically to minimize disease burden in HIV/AIDS."
5238,0.01,2.0000,"A human host offers a variety of microenvironments to the infecting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), resulting in various selective pressures, most of them directed against the envelope (env) gene. Therefore, it seems evident that the replicative capacity of the virus is largely related to viral entry. In this study we have used growth competition experiments and TaqMan real-time PCR detection to measure the fitness of subtype B HIV-1 primary isolates and autologous env-recombinant viruses in order to analyze the contribution of wild-type env sequences to overall HIV-1 fitness. A significant correlation was observed between fitness values obtained for wild-type HIV-1 isolates and those for the corresponding env-recombinant viruses (r = 0.93; P = 0.002). Our results suggest that the env gene, which is linked to a myriad of viral characteristics (e.g., entry into the host cell, transmission, coreceptor usage, and tropism), plays a major role in fitness of wild-type HIV-1. In addition, this new recombinant assay may be useful for measuring the contribution of HIV-1 env to fitness in viruses resistant to novel antiretroviral entry inhibitors."
7720,0.01,2.0000,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
6743,0.01,2.0000,"We have used the polymerase chain reaction technique to clone the small multiply spliced mRNA species produced after infection of human cells by a molecular clone of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We identified six Rev-expressing mRNAs, which were generated by the use of two splice acceptors located immediately upstream of the rev AUG. The class of small mRNAs included 12 mRNAs expressing Tat, Rev, and Nef. In addition, HIV-1 produced other multiply spliced mRNAs that used alternative splice sites identified by cloning and sequencing. All of these mRNAs were found in the cytoplasm and should be able to produce additional proteins. The coding capacity of the tat, rev, and nef mRNAs was analyzed by transfection of the cloned cDNAs into human cells. The tat mRNAs produced high levels of Tat, but very low levels of Rev and Nef. All the rev mRNAs expressed high levels of both Rev and Nef and were essential for the production of sufficient amounts of Rev. Therefore, HIV-1 uses both alternatively spliced and bicistronic mRNAs for the production of Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins."

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for all pregnancy-related discharges, pregnancy complications and viral hepatitis from 1995 to 2005. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between HBV, HCV, HBV + HCV and pregnancy-related complications including GDM, PTB, IUGR, pre-eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, cholestasis and caesarean delivery. Model covariates included maternal age, race, insurance status, substance use and medical complications including liver complication, hypertension, HIV, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and sexually transmitted infections. Of 297 664 pregnant women data available for analysis, 1446 had a coded diagnosis of HBV, HCV or both. High-risk behaviours, such as smoking, alcohol and substance use were higher in women with either HBV or HCV. Women with HBV had an increased risk for PTB (aOR 1.65, CI [1.3, 2.0]) but a decreased risk for caesarean delivery (aOR 0.686, CI [0.53, 0.88]). Individuals with HCV had an increased risk for GDM (aOR 1.6, CI [1.0, 2.6]). Individuals with both HBV and HCV co-infection had an increased risk for antepartum haemorrhage (aOR 2.82, CI [1.1, 7.2]). There was no association of viral hepatitis with IUGR or pre-eclampsia. Women with hepatitis have an increased risk for complications during pregnancy. Research to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of counselling patients about potential risks for adverse outcomes is warranted."
8017,0.01,2.0000,"A patient who presented with late stage HIV-associated diseases could not be diagnosed by commercial ELISA tests and a Western blot. However, we could amplify proviral DNA of HIV-1. We found a novel GPGGMI motif in the V3 loop, a novel insertion of a proline in the C3 region, and persistent deletion of two amino acids in the vif gene. The patient had been treated with HAART after diagnosis. Forty months after the first amplification of HIV-1 DNA, anti-HIV-1 antibody was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot and, thus, we amplified and sequenced HIV-1 full sequences. Interestingly, the sequence at the TATAA box was TAAAA, although full sequences were not CRF01_AE. The major differences in the level of the HIV-1 gene between the seronegative and seropositive states were changes at the glycosylation site (NXT) next to the inserted proline and many resistance mutations including M184V to antiretroviral drugs occurred. This is the first report on HIV-1 full sequences isolated from seronegative AIDS patients infected with subtype B in Korea."
3603,0.01,2.0000,"Characterization of HIV-1 from slow progressors is important to facilitate vaccine and antiviral drug development. To identify virus attenuations that may contribute to slower rates of disease progression, the full-length viral genomes from primary isolates of six slow progressing HIV-positive children were sequenced. Proviral DNA was extracted from cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to PCR amplify, sequence, and extensively analyze the near full-length genomes and LTR regions. All primary HIV-1 isolates were HIV-1 subtype C throughout their genome, and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all genes. However, all isolates had at least one unusual gene/protein. For example, isolate LT5 had a 2AA insertion in the Vpr mitochondriotoxic domain. Isolate LT21 contained an additional 5AA in the C-terminus of tat exon 2, while integrase in isolate LT39 had an additional 4AA at the C-terminus. Rev from isolates LT45 and LT46 did not have the characteristic subtype C 16AA truncation, and in addition, had a further 3AA. Furthermore, altered functional domains were noted in several isolates, such as the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA phosphorylation site in Nef (LT5), a Vpr mutation involved in decreased proapoptotic activity (all isolates), and the Nef ExxxLL motif involved in the interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 (LT46). The slower HIV-1 disease progression in these six children may be attributed to altered protein functions. For example, LT46 Nef is unable to bind AP-1 and AP-2 and therefore is inactive on CD4 endocytosis. The biological relevance of these findings requires further investigation."
1772,0.01,2.0000,"Tat is a protein that dramatically increases the expression of all genes expressed from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat through interaction with a cis-acting target sequence referred to as TAR (for trans-acting responsive region). The tat gene is divided into two coding exons which, when translated, result in the synthesis of an 86-amino-acid protein. However, the 72-amino-acid segment encoded by the first coding exon of tat is sufficient to encode a fully active Tat protein in known assays. We examined expression of the env gene from an LTR that lacks TAR (designated dTAR-env). Surprisingly, only the full-length Tat peptide trans activated expression of the env gene from dTAR-env. Comparison of RNA and protein expression of the env gene in the presence of Tat indicated that the mechanism of trans activation is posttranscriptional rather than transcriptional. To test whether the TAR-independent Tat function is specific to the HIV-1 env gene, we analyzed expression of heterologous genes from the long terminal repeat lacking TAR. These heterologous genes were not trans activated by Tat in the absence of a TAR element, which suggests that the second-exon peptide of Tat has a sequence-specific role in TAR-independent trans activation of the HIV-1 env gene. Analysis of a mutant in the 5' end of the env gene was used to identify a cis-acting sequence required for Tat responsiveness."
1820,0.01,2.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
22,0.01,2.0000,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 functions as a bimodal tether during lentiviral DNA integration: its C-terminal integrase-binding domain interacts with the viral preintegration complex, whereas the N-terminal PWWP domain can bind to cellular chromatin. The molecular basis for the integrase-LEDGF/p75 interaction is understood, while the mechanism of chromatin binding is unknown. The PWWP domain is homologous to other protein interaction modules that together comprise the Tudor clan. Based on primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structural similarities, 24 residues of the LEDGF/p75 PWWP domain were mutagenized to garner essential details of its function during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mutating either Trp-21 or Ala-51, which line the inner wall of a hydrophobic cavity that is common to Tudor clan members, disrupts chromatin binding and virus infectivity. Consistent with a role for chromatin-associated LEDGF/p75 in stimulating integrase activity during infection, recombinant W21A protein is preferentially defective for enhancing integration into chromatinized target DNA in vitro. The A51P mutation corresponds to the S270P change in DNA methyltransferase 3B that causes human immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly syndrome, revealing a critical role for this amino acid position in the chromatin binding functions of varied PWWP domains. Our results furthermore highlight the requirement for a conserved Glu in the hydrophobic core that mediates interactions between other Tudor clan members and their substrates. This initial systematic mutagenesis of a PWWP domain identifies amino acid residues critical for chromatin binding function and the consequences of their changes on HIV-1 integration and infection."

High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."

HIV seroprevalence in STD clinics ranged from 0 to 38.5% (median, 2.3%), with the highest rates found in the Mid-Atlantic states, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The highest median rates were found in men who have sex with men (36.1%) and heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users (4.1%). For heterosexual persons who do not report IV drug use, median rates were highest in the 35- to 39-year-old age group for men (6.4%) and the 30- to 34-year-old age group for women (0.9%). Among persons who do not report risk behaviors for HIV infection, men had substantially higher median rates of HIV infection than women (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test), and rates were positively correlated with HIV infection rates in IV drug users in the same clinic (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.8; P less than 0.001). Among heterosexual STD clinic patients who do not report IV drug use, the median HIV infection rate for blacks (1.8%) was at least 2 times higher than the median infection rates for hispanics (0.9%) and whites (0.7%). The results of this study show that HIV infection in STD clinic patients varies by geographic area, sex, race and ethnic group, and risk behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4530,0.01,2.0000,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."

Thirty-five cases were women who accepted postpartum sterilization and twenty-two controls were women who refused this method. The acceptance of tubal occlusion was statistically more frequent in multiparous women, and in those with previous children infected with HIV. The antecedent of at least one previous pregnancy had an association with the acceptance of tubal occlusion with an OR of 11.2 (CI 95% 2.9 to 42.9); having at least one previous child HIV-infected had an OR of 4.6 (CI 95% 1.3 to 23.1).

This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."

Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."

A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia.

2736,0.01,2.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy dramatically decreases in vivo viral replication to levels below the level of clinical detection, but does not eradicate HIV-1 infection on the basis of persistent low-level or cryptic viral replication and latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. Immune activation therapy has begun to be used in attempts to increase the turnover rate of the latent virus reservoir through activation of infected cells that comprise this reservoir, in order to promote cell death and accelerate virus clearance. Recent reports have not demonstrated complete virus ablation. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation now appears as a safe, feasible, and reasonable approach for Aids-related lymphoma in patients who meet criteria for transplantation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells from a HIV-positive patient could be collected before the patient becomes infected with HIV. Then, the proposed treatment consists of the following assumptions. HAART keeps viral replication below the level of detection, limiting the infection to latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. It is presumed here that myeloablative conditioning regimen can lead to the killing of all the cells that, in theory, harbour the virus. The following transplantation of the autologous hematopoietic stem cells, collected before HIV infection, would allow the complete recovery. The hypothesis is to be tested on a suitable animal model. After the collection of hematopoietic stem cells, the animal is experimentally infected with the immunodeficiency virus. HAART is given after plasma viral RNA becomes detectable. By myeloablative conditioning regimen all the cells harbouring the virus are supposed to be killed. Then, as the viral load is kept undetectable by HAART, the animal undergoes autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Antiretroviral therapy is interrupted a month after engraftment has taken place. Although hematopoietic stem cells from man before infection with HIV are unlikely to be available, a successful test on the animal would suggest a new approach which could allow the cure of HIV in future."
7308,0.01,2.0000,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."
9606,0.01,2.0000,"Of all the hepatotropic viruses, HBV is associated with the greatest worldwide morbidity and mortality. This is because of the ease of transmission and the potential for progression to a chronic infective carrier state, with the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of PCR has shown that some of the earlier concepts concerning the interpretation of serological data were inaccurate. Many patients with anti-HBe and anti-HBs have viral DNA detectable by PCR, and some hepatocellular carcinoma patients have detectable HBV DNA in their livers in the absence of all serological markers of HBV disease. The clearance of HBV infected cells from the liver is dependent on the interplay between the interferon system and the cellular limb of the host immune response. The importance of the nucleocapsid proteins as targets for sensitized cytotoxic T cells has been established for chronic HBV infection. The importance of pre-S sequences as inducers and targets of the virus-neutralizing humoral immune response is becoming established, but their precise role must await the development of in vitro models of hepadnavirus infection and a greater understanding of the mechanisms of viral uptake. The epidemiology and clinical course of the disease can be modified by immunization, immune stimulation and antiviral chemotherapy. For the developing world, a programme of immunization at birth would be the most effective way of eliminating this disease, but at present the cost is prohibitive. For the developed world, immunization is realistic for the at-risk population, and anti-viral and immunostimulatory therapy available for those already infected. In adult acquired chronic HBV infection alpha-interferon produces HBe antigen clearance in 40-60% of cases and is followed by resolution of the hepatic inflammation. Results in neonatally acquired infection are less impressive and prednisolone priming followed by interferon may be needed. The presence of a mutation in the pre-core region of some virus isolates has recently been described. Hepatocytes infected with this virus cannot produce HBe antigen and the course of the liver disease is fairly rapid. Whether this mutant causes liver damage in the same way as the wild virus or is directly cytopathic remains unclear, and its relationship to fulminant hepatitis is under investigation."

2231,0.01,2.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the Health Enlightenment, Awareness and Living Intervention, designed to decrease HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and related risky behaviors. The thirteen-session intervention was implemented among homeless and formerly incarcerated low-income African American women, ages 18 to 55, in Atlanta, Georgia from 2006 to 2010. A single group repeated measures study design was employed and consisted of a pre-test (n = 355) group, an immediate post-test (n = 228) group with a response rate of 64%, and a six-month follow up (n = 110) group with response rate of 48%, completing a 135-item survey. Paired-sample t-tests, McNemar tests, and repeated measures ANOVA were applied to compare survey results. Participants demonstrated statistically significant increases in hepatitis B and C knowledge over time (p < 0.001). Statistically significant decreases were also reported for unprotected sex in exchange for money, drugs or shelter (p = 0.008), and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (p < 0.001). Reported substance use decreased with statistical significance for alcohol (p = 0.011), marijuana (p = 0.011), illegal drugs (p = 0.002), and crack/cocaine (p = 0.003). Findings broaden the evidence base related to the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis risk reduction interventions designed for homeless and previously incarcerated African American women."
2882,0.01,2.0000,"The source and dynamics of persistent HIV-1 during long-term combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) are critical to understanding the barriers to curing HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we isolated and genetically characterized HIV-1 DNA from naïve and memory T cells from peripheral blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from eight patients after 4-12 y of suppressive cART. Our detailed analysis of these eight patients indicates that persistent HIV-1 in peripheral blood and GALT is found primarily in memory CD4(+) T cells [CD45RO(+)/CD27((+/-))]. The HIV-1 infection frequency of CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood and GALT was higher in patients who initiated treatment during chronic compared with acute/early infection, indicating that early initiation of therapy results in lower HIV-1 reservoir size in blood and gut. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an HIV-1 genetic change between RNA sequences isolated before initiation of cART and intracellular HIV-1 sequences from the T-cell subsets after 4-12 y of suppressive cART in four of the eight patients. However, evolutionary rate analyses estimated no greater than three nucleotide substitutions per gene region analyzed during all of the 4-12 y of suppressive therapy. We also identified a clearly replication-incompetent viral sequence in multiple memory T cells in one patient, strongly supporting asynchronous cell replication of a cell containing integrated HIV-1 DNA as the source. This study indicates that persistence of a remarkably stable population of infected memory cells will be the primary barrier to a cure, and, with little evidence of viral replication, this population could be maintained by homeostatic cell proliferation or other processes.

116,0.005,1.0000,"Experience with hepatitis B suggests that the risk of HIV transmission from a health care worker infected with HIV to a patient will be greatest during major surgical procedures. The number of patients worldwide who are known to have undergone such procedures, been notified, and subsequently tested is still too small to be confident that the risk of HIV transmission in these circumstances is negligible. We describe a patient notification exercise, undertaken in the United Kingdom in 1991. Attempts were made to contact 1217 patients, in three health districts (A, B, and C), who had undergone surgical procedures performed by an obstetrician/gynaecologist who was infected with HIV. The exercise aimed to offer the patients reassurance, counselling and--if they wished--HIV testing. One thousand one hundred and forty-two patients (94%) were contacted, and all 520 who elected to be tested were negative for anti-HIV. The proportion of identified patients tested was 63% in district A, 35% in district B, and 61% in district C. Surgical procedures were classified retrospectively according to the likely risk (none, possible, or high) of exposure to the doctor's blood and, therefore, risk of HIV transmission. One hundred and ninety-five of those tested had undergone a procedure that carried a high risk of exposure; 179 had undergone a procedure thought to carry no risk. Patients in districts A and C who had undergone a procedure that carried a high risk of exposure were more likely to be tested than those who had not; 206 patients overall had undergone procedures that carried a high risk of exposure but were not subsequently tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

4629,0.005,1.0000,"It has been well known that the transmission of HB virus is associated with mass inoculation and other medical procedures. In order to make clear the relation between HBV infection and the mass survey for filariasis on which sera of the examinees were drawn from their earlobes for the detecting of microfilaria with inadequately sterilized instruments, a epidemiological study was conducted in Miyako district. Okinawa prefecture, Japan, in which both HBV infection and filariasis were prevalent. A total of 2,231 inhabitants were investigated for HBV seromarkers. The over all positive rate of HBs antigen was 6.3% with the highest rate of 15.5% in the group of age 25 to 29. On the other hand, the prevalence rate of HBs antibody continued to increase along with age group, and remained to be over 60% after 30 years of age. The positive rates of both HBs antigen and antibody in the subject district were higher than those in other place of Okinawa prefecture or Japan. Comparing yearly attack rates of HBV chronologically, which were calculated from the age-specific HBV exposure rates in the district, the annual incidence of HBV infection was 6.1% (%/year) between 1954 to 1958, 5.2% (%/year) between 1959 to 1963, and then 4.4 (%/year) in the period of 1964 to 1968 in which the proportion of examinees for the survey of filariasis was the highest. In conclusion, the mass survey for filariasis was not the main factor contributing to the high prevalence of HBV infection in Miyako district."
9142,0.005,1.0000,"This study aims at estimating the recent trends in HIV-1 prevalence and the factors associated with infection among pregnant women in the Gulu District of north Uganda, a rural area severely affected by civil strife. In 2000-2003, a total of 4459 antenatal clinic attendees of Lacor Hospital were anonymously tested for HIV-1 infection. The overall and age-specific prevalence did not show any significant trend over time. The age-standardized prevalence slightly declined, from 12.1% in 2000 to 11.3% in 2003. Increased age [20-24 years: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.63; 95% CI 1.18-2.25; >or=25 years: AOR 2.56; 95% CI 1.91-3.44], residence in urban areas (AOR 1.76; 95% CI 1.41-2.18), being unmarried (AOR 1.60; 95% CI 1.27-2.01), increased age of partner (25-34 years: AOR 1.87; 95% CI 1.29-2.73; >or=35 years: AOR 2.68; 95% CI 1.72-4.16), modern occupation of partner (AOR 1.98; 95% CI 1.53-2.58), and short time of residence at the current address (AOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.05-1.76) were associated with infection. The HIV-1 prevalence in this rural district is high and similar to that observed in urban antenatal clinics, probably reflecting the effect of the last 18 years of civil strife."
8086,0.005,1.0000,"In recent years, increasing numbers of patients infected with HIV-1 non-B subtypes have been treated with modern antiretroviral regimens. Therefore, a better knowledge of HIV drug resistance in non-B strains is crucial. Thus, we compared the mutational pathways involved in drug resistance among the most common non-B subtypes in Italy (F, C, and CRF02_AG) and the B subtype. In total, 2234 pol sequences from 1231 virologically failing patients from Central Italy were analyzed. The prevalence of resistance mutations in protease and reverse transcriptase between non-B and B subtypes has been evaluated. Among patients treated with nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and with thymidine analogues (TA) experience, TAMs1 M41L and L210W were less prevalent in CRF02_AG, while TAMs2 T215F and K219E were more prevalent in the F subtype. In NRTI-treated patients having experience with abacavir, didanosine, tenofovir, or stavudine the K65R mutation was mostly prevalent in the C subtype. In non-NRTI (NNRTI)-treated patients infected by the C subtype the prevalence of K103N was lower than in patients infected with other subtypes, while the prevalence of Y181C and Y188L was higher compared to subtype B. The prevalence of Y181C was higher also in subtype F as compared to subtype B. In patients treated with protease inhibitors, L89V was predominantly found in CRF02_AG, while the TPV resistance mutation T74P was predominantly found in the C subtype. Some differences in the genotypic drug resistance have been found among patients infected with B, C, F, and CRF02_AG subtypes in relationship to treatment. These results may be useful for the therapeutic management of individuals infected with HIV-1 non-B strains."
9856,0.005,1.0000,Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been associated with many changes in the complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cohort of 25 HIV patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) treated with HAART experienced a median survival of >46 weeks. This is an improvement in prognosis compared with recent historic experience and correlated with HIV RNA viral load reductions. We conclude that current HIV therapy is important in improving the outlook of PML in the setting of HIV.

In 23 out of the 90 patients with acute hepatitis A, evidence of previous experience with hepatitis B virus (HBV) was found, whereas 35 out of the 50 patients with acute hepatitis B had past contact with hepatitis A virus (HAV). The mean peak ALT values [S.D.] were significantly higher in hepatitis A patients with previous experience with HBV (1413 [704] i.u./l), when compared to those without such experience (842 [464] i.u./l, P less than 0.001). Such a difference was not evident between acute hepatitis B patients, whether or not they had previous contact with HAV. We conclude that when acute hepatitis A is superimposed on past HBV infection an augmented transaminaemia, indicative of enhanced liver cell necrosis, takes place although a definite explanation is lacking. We suggest that individuals with markers of HBV infection should be early candidates for HAV immunization."
34,0.005,1.0000,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "
2061,0.005,1.0000,"A total of 2,283 serum samples were collected from healthy subjects in three islands of the Yaeyama district of Okinawa, Japan. These sera were tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and for antibody to adult T-cell leukemia-associated antigen (anti-ATLA). Correlation between hepatitis B virus infection and adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV) infection was determined by using the prevalence rates for three virus markers. Overall prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-ATLA was 6.5%, 57.4%, and 17.9%, respectively. Age-specific prevalence of anti-HBc and anti-ATLA increased with age, but that of HBsAg did not. Sex-specific prevalence of HBsAg was significantly higher in males than in females, but that of anti-ATLA was significantly higher in females than in males. Statistical analysis revealed that prevalence of anti-ATLA was significantly higher in HBsAg-positive persons and HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive persons than in those negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc. These data suggest that hepatitis B virus-infected persons have a significantly higher chance of adult T-cell leukemia virus infection than those without hepatitis B virus infection in the area studied."

Many orphans in UNM report symptoms of psychological trauma. The primary study objective was to evaluate a multidisciplinary program integrating HIV prevention with an existing package of mental health services. We randomly selected 120 orphans between ages 15-25 years served by UNM and evaluated sexually-transmitted infections, HIV risk-taking behaviors and knowledge, and mental health at baseline, 5, 9, and 12 months. Increased trauma symptoms at baseline were associated with poorer coping skills and social functioning, and increased psychological distress and HIV risk-taking behavior. Following the 12-month intervention, trauma symptoms declined significantly, with those accessing counseling services showing greatest improvement. Orphans with the highest trauma scores benefited most from the intervention. In this at-risk population, addressing mental health issues in the context of HIV prevention is critical."

Therefore, HIV/AIDS still remains a public health emergency and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. It is believed that reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of HIV-1, and thereby RT has been the important drug target for antiretroviral (ARV) chemotherapy against AIDS. To our knowledge, dipyridodiazepinone analogs have been considered as one class of potential non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), especially the structurally and chemically related nevirapine (Viramune(R)), which was the first NNRTI approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection for adults in 1996 and for children in 1998. This review mainly highlights the progress of synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of dipyridodiazepinone analogs; in the meantime, the mechanism of action is also presented. It will pave the way for the design and development of novel dipyridodiazepinone analogs as NNRTIs in AIDS chemotherapy in the future."
6647,0.005,1.0000,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) has been described in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, but data on associated factors are still unclear, and to our knowledge, no reports are available in Brazil. Our goal was to evaluate BMD in HIV patients attending an outpatient clinic in Vitoria, Brazil. A sectional study was performed in 300 HIV-infected patients to measure BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Age, gender, anthropometric parameters, nadir and current CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, smoking habit, and current antiretroviral therapy (ART) associations were investigated by multivariable analysis. Based on World Health Organization T-score ranges, low BMD (T-score <-1.0 standard deviation [SD] in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 and older or Z-score <- 2.0 SD in premenopausal women and men below the age of 50) was detected in 54.7% (95% confidence interval: 49.1-60.3%) of the 300 enrolled patients. The observed median age was 46 yr (interquartile range: 39-52), 58% were male, 88.5% were on ART, and 21.4% smoked. The following factors were identified, by multiple logistic modeling, as being independently associated with low BMD: (1) male gender (4.6 [1.28-16.39]), (2) body mass index lower than 25 kg/m(2) (2.9 [1.31-6.49]), (3) menopause (13.4 [2.53-71.12]), and (4) HIV-1 undetectable viral load (7.9 [1.96-32.25]). Conversely, zidovudine (0.2 [0.04-0.85]) and nevirapine (0.1 [0.02-0.38]) use were inversely associated with low BMD. Low BMD was frequently found in our cohort of about 300 Brazilian HIV-infected subjects. This study supports the need for periodic DXA testing in HIV outpatient clinics."
9916,0.005,1.0000,"Humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic cells have been developed as an experimental animal model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Myeloablative irradiation is usually performed to augment the engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in recipient mice; however, some mouse strains are susceptible to irradiation, making longitudinal analysis difficult. We previously attempted to construct humanized NOD/SCID/JAK3(null) (hNOJ) mice, which were not irradiated prior to human HSC transplantation. We found that, over time, many of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells expanded with an activated effector memory phenotype. Therefore, the present study used hNOJ mice that were irradiated (hNOJ (IR+)) or not (hNOJ (IR-)) prior to human HSC transplantation to examine whether the development and cellularity of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells were influenced by the degree of chimerism, and whether they affected HIV-1 infectivity. Indeed, hNOJ (IR+) mice showed a greater degree of chimerism than hNOJ (IR-) mice. However, the conversion of CD4(+) T cells to an activated effector memory phenotype, with a high percentage of cells showing Ki-67 expression, occurred in both hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, probably as a result of lymphopenia-induced homeostatic expansion. Furthermore, when hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, which were selected as naïve- and memory CD4(+) T cell subset-rich groups, respectively, were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in vivo, virus replication (as assessed by the plasma viral load) was delayed; however, the titer subsequently reached a 1-log higher level in memory-rich hNOJ (IR-) mice than in naïve-rich hNOJ (IR+) mice, indicating that virus infectivity in hNOJ mice was affected by the different status of the reconstituted CD4(+) T cells. Therefore, the hNOJ mouse model should be used selectively, i.e., according to the specific experimental objectives, to gain an appropriate understanding of HIV-1 infection/pathogenesis."
4517,0.005,1.0000,"Prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation after AIDS diagnosis, in the absence of certain opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, delays disease progression and death, but system barriers to inpatient ART initiation at large hospitals in the era of modern ART have been less studied. We reviewed hospitalizations for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in 2011 and 2012. Individual- and system-level variables were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for ART initiation prior to discharge. With Georgia Department of Health surveillance data, we estimated time to first clinic visit, ART initiation, and viral suppression. In the study population (n = 81), ART was initiated prior to discharge in 10 (12%) patients. Shorter hospital stay was significantly associated with lack of ART initiation at the time of HIV diagnosis (8 versus 24 days, OR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.25). Reducing barriers to ART initiation for newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients with short hospital stays may improve time to viral suppression."
6571,0.005,1.0000,"The highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces HIV-1 RNA in plasma to undetectable levels. However, the virus continues to persist in the long-lived resting CD4(+) T cells, macrophages and astrocytes which form a viral reservoir in infected individuals. Reactivation of viral transcription is critical since the host immune response in combination with antiretroviral therapy may eradicate the virus. Using the chronically HIV-1 infected T lymphoblastoid and monocytic cell lines, primary quiescent CD4(+) T cells and humanized mice infected with dual-tropic HIV-1 89.6, we examined the effect of various X-ray irradiation (IR) doses (used for HIV-related lymphoma treatment and lower doses) on HIV-1 transcription and viability of infected cells. Treatment of both T cells and monocytes with IR, a well-defined stress signal, led to increase of HIV-1 transcription, as evidenced by the presence of RNA polymerase II and reduction of HDAC1 and methyl transferase SUV39H1 on the HIV-1 promoter. This correlated with the increased GFP signal and elevated level of intracellular HIV-1 RNA in the IR-treated quiescent CD4(+) T cells infected with GFP-encoding HIV-1. Exposition of latently HIV-1infected monocytes treated with PKC agonist bryostatin 1 to IR enhanced transcription activation effect of this latency-reversing agent. Increased HIV-1 replication after IR correlated with higher cell death: the level of phosphorylated Ser46 in p53, responsible for apoptosis induction, was markedly higher in the HIV-1 infected cells following IR treatment. Exposure of HIV-1 infected humanized mice with undetectable viral RNA level to IR resulted in a significant increase of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, lung and brain tissues. Collectively, these data point to the use of low to moderate dose of IR alone or in combination with HIV-1 transcription activators as a potential application for the ""Shock and Kill"" strategy for latently HIV-1 infected cells.

The study objective was to evaluate the quality of laboratory performance in testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody. After identifying relevant variables in univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed using stepwise logistic models. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody test performance was independently associated with analytic variables such as commercial test kit used and with nonanalytic variables such as experience, training, and degree requirements of laboratory personnel.

3118,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we examined the potential defects in upstream insulin signaling pathways in liver specimens obtained from nonobese/nondiabetic subjects with HCV infection. Fasting liver biopsy specimens were obtained from 42 HCV-infected subjects and 10 non-HCV-infected subjects matched for age and body mass index. Liver tissues were exposed to insulin and examined for the contents and phosphorylation/activation status of the upstream insulin signaling molecules by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. HCV infection resulted in a trend toward a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 contents when compared with non-HCV. In contrast, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased by 2-fold in HCV-infected subjects compared with non-HCV-infected subjects (P <.05). The observed reductions in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were accompanied by a 3.4-fold decrease in IRS-1/p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) association and a 2.5-fold decrease in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase enzymatic activity (P <.05 vs. non-HCV). This was accompanied by a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation without any alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Cellular contents of the hepatic p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were comparable between HCV-infected and non-HCV-infected subjects. In conclusion, we found that (1). HCV infection leads to a postreceptor defect in IRS-1 association with the IR and (2). insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase association/activation may contribute to insulin resistance, which leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with HCV infection."
7706,0.005,1.0000,"The seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) markers was evaluated in a group of 2042 subjects from a rural area in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, to obtain a better understanding of the transmission patterns of these viruses. Antibodies to HIV-1 were detected in 12 subjects (0.6%); the seroprevalence did not differ significantly by age or gender. Overall seroprevalence for HCV was 1.7% (in patients aged > 40 years, 5.6%). Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in 8.8% of subjects, with the higher seroprevalence in children aged < or = 18 years of 13.4% contrasting with the higher seroprevalence of HCV in older subjects of the Equatoguinean studied population. These results indicate differences in the distribution of the viruses and, probably, different routes of transmission. The study demonstrates the existence of a high HBV carrier rate in children, concluding that hepatitis B vaccine should be incorporated into the Expanded Programme on Vaccination in Equatorial Guinea."
7159,0.005,1.0000,The effect of universal hepatitis B vaccination on the prevalence of serologically negative hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and the emergence of HBsAg variants is unknown. We prospectively studied two different cohorts of 12--24 month old children in South Africa. They consisted of the unvaccinated children (n=459) born before the introduction of universal vaccination and the vaccinated children (n=1213) between 1 and 2 years after the introduction of the vaccination program. The frequency of detecting HBV DNA by PCR was reduced from 6.5% in unvaccinated children to 0.3% in vaccinated children (P<0.00001). There were no unique amino acid substitutions within the major hydrophilic region of the S sequence in both pre- and post-vaccination samples. Universal childhood vaccination reduced the frequency of serologically negative HBV infection and did not necessarily lead to selection of escape variants.

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and immunity against HBV among HIV-infected individuals in South Brazil, and identify factors that are associated with compliance patterns and antibody reactivity. Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "

Four to eighty-five months after immunization, only 7 children (37%) were immune. There were no significant differences in the HIV classification of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, type of conjugate vaccine, age at vaccination or serologic testing, time from vaccination to antibody determination, and CD4 cell counts between children with and those without immunity."

In the group of 234 HIV-infected patients, 72 persons (30.8%) were anti-HAV-T positive (>20 IU/L). In multivariate analysis, two independent factors associated with the presence of anti-HAV-T were identified: the age of patients (OR = 1.07) and the presence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (OR = 2.87). Vaccination was completed in 83 patients. Good response (anti-HAV-T >20 IU/L one month after the booster dose) was obtained in 79.5% of patients. In patients with CD4 >200 cells/µL in multivariate analysis only presence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus was a prognostic factor for the response to vaccination (OR = 0.13). Among responders available for the follow-up, 82% (50 out of 61) had detectable anti-HAV-T at 1 year and 75.5% (37 out of 49) at 5 years. Our results demonstrate that most of the studied HIV-positive patients were susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection. Most HIV-infected adults with high CD4 counts had a durable response even up to 5 years after vaccination. Patients with a HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfection displayed a worse response to vaccination.

1163,0.005,1.0000,"The follow-up of HBV markers in selected high infection risk populations, in patients from the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis services was used to assess the effectiveness of a special vaccination program. Viral infection markers were studied in prevalence cross sections of the whole population of patients, and also by recording the reports of clinical cases of hepatitis B occurred during that period in those groups of patients. The prevention program consisted of the vaccination of all patients negative to the viral markers and the indication of vaccination for the new cases during the period of the kidney disease, just before the start of the treatment at the hemodialysis unit; besides all the persons susceptible to infection that had already been included in the program, regardless of the stage of the disease. The results show the benefit of the vaccination in these patients, but it is more effective in the period before the treatment with dialysis where there is a lower possibility of being exposed to the virus and the immune system is still competent. Once the program was established, after a follow up o 6 years, there have been no reports of new cases of hepatitis B and the incidence of the disease has been declining."
715,0.005,1.0000,"Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is common among people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and affects their daily functional ability and quality of life. Lower extremity functional ability, which is most commonly compromised in patients with PN, has not been clearly evaluated in an African setting, with regard to functional limitations. The lower extremity functional scale (LEFS) was originally developed and validated among elderly people in the USA, where the environment and activities of daily life are very different from those in Rwanda. The purpose of this study was to adapt and establish the reliability of LEFS, among adults living with HIV on ART, in a Rwandan environment. The study translated LEFS from English to Kinyarwanda, the local language spoken in Rwanda, the LEFS was then modified accordingly, and tested for test-retest reliability among 50 adult PLHIV on ART. An average Spearman rank order correlation coefficient, ρ ≥ 0.7, was considered optimal for reliability. Prior to the modification of the LEFS and in the initial testing of the translated LEFS, none of the activities was strongly correlated (ρ ≥ 0.8); most of the activities (90%, 18/20) were moderately correlated (ρ ≥ 0.5) and 10% (2/20) were weakly correlated (ρ ≤ 0.5). The ρ of most of the functional activities improved after modification by an expert group to ρ ≥ 0.7, establishing reliability and validity of LEFS among PLHIV on ART with lower extremity functional limitations, in this environment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the importance of modifying and establishing test - retest reliability of tools derived from developed world contexts to local conditions in developing countries, such as in Rwanda. The modified LEFS in this study can be used in Rwanda by clinicians, specifically at ART clinics to screen and identify people with functional limitations at an early stage of the limitations, for treatment, rehabilitation and/or referral to appropriate health care services."
8177,0.005,1.0000,"Risk factors for heterosexual HIV transmission are not fully understood. In fact, a proportion of people with sexual exposure to HIV remain uninfected despite multiple and continuous intercourse with HIV-infected partners. In this work, we have analyzed those virologic parameters potentially involved in the transmission of HIV through heterosexual contact. Thirty-eight couples with continuous unprotected sexual intercourse were included. HIV transmission occurred in 10 of 38 couples. No differences in clinical characteristics, exposure time, sexual practices, CD4 counts, or polymorphism in CCR5 were found between transmitter and nontransmitter groups. In contrast, virologic data were different between both groups; median values of viral load were 21.139 and 5.484 RNA copies/ml of plasma in the transmitter and nontransmitter groups, respectively, and a significant difference was found in mean viral load values (p = .03, Mann-Whitney test). Viral isolation was obtained in 90% of transmitters, but in only 44% of nontransmitter subjects (p = .02, Fisher's exact test). These data show that viral load levels and a positive viral isolation in culture must be considered as risk factors for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1."
6962,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to investigate the correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related discrimination among general practitioners. The survey, conducted in 1993-1994, covered a random sample of 878 general practitioners from six of the 12 New South Wales health areas, augmented by 44-general practitioners from the same areas who were antiretroviral drug prescribers. The response rate was 51 per cent, and the final usable sample was 451. Variables examined were: demographic characteristics, the number of HIV-infected patients, personal contact with people living with HIV or AIDS, personal contact with homosexuals, the degree of anxiety about HIV or AIDS, and the degree of HIV-related discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes among general practitioners decreased as contact with HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001), other people living with HIV or AIDS (P < 0.001), and homosexuals (P < 0.001) increased. Anxiety about HIV or AIDS also decreased as contact increased (P < 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were strongly associated with higher levels of HIV-related discrimination (P < 0.001). The demographic correlates of discrimination among general practitioners were the same as those found in the wider population. The professional care of people living with HIV and AIDS was concentrated among a small number of general practitioners, many of whom were homosexual. Ten general practitioners were carrying extraordinarily high caseloads of over 200 HIV-infected patients each. Older, heterosexual and male general practitioners are an important target for education campaigns, and the professional care of people living with HIV or AIDS should be encouraged among a wider group of general practitioners."

Compared with the controls, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced in all groups (P < 0.01). Plasma triglyceride was increased in patients taking protease inhibitors (P < 0.05). VLDL and IDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was lower in all treatment groups (P < 0.05) compared with controls. Trunk fat, VLDL apoB absolute secretion rate, and insulin resistance were not different between groups. Peripheral fat was lower in the treated patients (P < 0.05) and correlated with duration of therapy (r = -0.55; P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between peripheral fat and VLDL apoB FCR (P = 0.002) and IDL apoB FCR (P = 0.002) and a negative correlation with VLDL apoB pool size, VLDL cholesterol, and triglyceride (P < 0.03; P < 0.01; P < 0.002). These results suggest that mild dyslipidemia resulting from antiretroviral therapy is caused by a decrease in VLDL and IDL apoB FCR, which is associated with a loss of peripheral fat."
6387,0.005,1.0000,"Carbovir (the carbocyclic analog of 2'-3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine) is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Assays were developed to assess the mechanism of inhibition by the 5'-triphosphate of carbovir of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either RNA or DNA templates that contain all four natural nucleotides. Carbovir-TP was a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either template with Ki values similar to that observed by AZT-TP, ddGTP, and ddTTP. The kinetic constants for incorporation of these nucleotide analogs into DNA by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase using either template were similar to the values seen for their respective natural nucleotides. In addition, the incorporation of either carbovir-TP or AZT-TP in the presence of dGTP or dTTP, respectively, indicated that the mechanism of inhibition by these two nucleotide analogs was due to their incorporation into the DNA resulting in chain termination. Carbovir-TP was not a potent inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha, beta, or gamma, or DNA primase. Given the potent activity of carbovir-TP against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and its lack of activity against human DNA polymerases, we believe that further evaluation of this compound as a potential drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infection is warranted."

1493,0.005,1.0000,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.

The protease inhibitors studied were Ro 31-8959, A-77003, XM323, L-735,524, and VX-478. Resistant variants with two to four mutations within their protease sequence and 9- to 40-fold-decreased susceptibility were selected for all five inhibitors within six to eight passes in cell culture. Passage of a zidovudine-resistant mutant in Ro 31-8959 generated a dual reverse transcriptase- and protease-resistant virus. Variants were cloned directly into a modified pHXB2-D infectious clone for cross-resistance analysis. Although the resistant variants selected possessed different combinations of protease mutations for each inhibitor, many showed cross-resistance to the other inhibitors, and one showed cross-resistance to all five inhibitors. Interestingly, some mutants showed increased susceptibility to some inhibitors. Further HIV passage studies in the combined presence of two protease inhibitors demonstrated that in vitro it was possible to delay significantly selection of mutations producing resistance to one or both inhibitors. These studies indicate that there may be some rationale for combining different protease inhibitors as well as protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV combination therapy."
4829,0.005,1.0000,"We have analyzed the sequences of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to evaluate the drug resistance-associated mutations. Of 84 HIV-1-infected individuals treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 43 (51.2%) have been found to carry amino acid substitutions predicted to acquire drug-resistances. One to 3 mutations at amino acid residues reported to be associated with protease inhibitor-resistance were detected in more than 80% of protease inhibitor-naive patients. However, these pre-existing mutations did not seem to raise a real resistance after the initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance assay was performed with 6 clinical isolates to compare with genotypic resistance. In most of the cases, phenotype was correlated with genotypic changes, however, two strains which were isolated from patients having no experience of chemotherapy showed a decrease in susceptibility to several drugs without any resistance-related mutations detected in their genes. Taken together, determination of phenotypic resistance is necessary, especially when a newly-infected patients starts antiviral therapy."
5998,0.005,1.0000,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."
6689,0.005,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
305,0.005,1.0000,"Besides mediating the viral entry process, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope protein gp41 can bind to many host cell components and regulate cell functions. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we screened a human bone marrow cDNA library and identified a novel gp41-binding protein, CD74 (the MHC class II-associated invariant chain). Here, we report possible biological effects mediated by interaction between gp41 and CD74. We found that HIV-1 gp41 could bind directly to host CD74 in HIV-1-infected cells, and the peptide 6358 derived from gp41 loop region (aa 597-611) could effectively block the gp41-CD74 interaction. As a result of this binding, recombinant soluble gp41 and gp41 peptide 6358 activated the CD74-mediated ERK/MAPK pathway and significantly enhanced HIV-1 infection in vitro. Conversely, the enhancing effect could be suppressed by the recombinant CD74 extracellular domain. These results reveal a novel mechanism underlying gp41 mediation of HIV-1 infection and replication."
8343,0.005,1.0000,"Antibodies that are useful in the treatment of HIV infection should result in virus neutralization or lysis of infected cells but should not enhance infection. In this study, the potential clinical use of 20 HIV-1-specific human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) was determined by measuring their enhancing (C-ADE) activities using HIVLAI as the target virus. Two HuMAbs mediated both C-ADE and ADCC, two exclusively neutralized, and five exclusively mediated ADCC. Ten HuMAbs demonstrated no activity in any of the three assays. Three antibodies that neutralized HIVLAI were tested against HIVSF2; all three also neutralized HIVSF2. Four of five HuMAbs mediating ADCC against HIVLAI that were also tested against HIVSF2 had ADCC activity against HIVSF2. These results demonstrate that many HuMAbs have unique functions, allowing the separation of potentially beneficial and harmful activities. Combinations of HuMAbs with ADCC and neutralizing functions may have therapeutic utility."

As a result, organ related manifestations of late stage HIV infection, including HIV-related heart diseases have emerged. It is now clear that cardiac involvement in HIV seropositive patients is relatively common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HIV infection is multifactorial. The epidemiology has changed dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but studies carried out before the introduction of HAART remain relevant because of limited access to this treatment in many areas of the world. A variety of cardiac lesions have been reported in HIV infection and AIDS, including pericardial disease with effusion and tamponade, nonspecific or infectious myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with global left ventricular dysfunction, endocardial valvular disease due to marantic or infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and neoplastic invasion. In the post HAART-era, coronary artery disease and dyslipidaemia, drug related cardiotoxicity and cardiac autonomic dysfunction are becoming increasingly prevalent. In this review, we highlight the importance of cardiac complications in HIV disease and discuss measures that can be taken to improve survival."

5734,0.005,1.0000,"Elucidation of mechanisms underlying the establishment, maintenance of and reactivation from HIV-1 latency is essential for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at eliminating HIV-1 reservoirs. Microbial translocation, as a consequence of HIV-1-induced deterioration of host immune system, is known to result in a systemic immune activation and transient outbursts of HIV-1 viremia in chronic HIV-1 infection. How these microbes cause the robust HIV-1 reactivation remains elusive. Dendritic cells (DCs) have previously been shown to reactivate HIV-1 from latency; however, the precise role of DCs in reactivating HIV-1 from latently infected T-cell remains obscure. In this study, by using HIV-1 latently infected Jurkat T cells, we demonstrated that AIDS-associated pathogens as represented by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and bacterial component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were unable to directly reactivate HIV-1 from Jurkat T cells; instead, they mature DCs to secrete TNF-α to accomplish this goal. Moreover, we found that HIV-1 latently infected Jurkat T cells could also mature DCs and enhance their TNF-α production during co-culture in a CD40-CD40L-signaling-dependent manner. This in turn led to viral reactivation from Jurkat T cells. Our results reveal how DCs help AIDS-associated pathogens to trigger HIV-1 reactivation from latency."

Nucleic acid extraction was performed manually by using either the Nuclisens isolation kit (which uses the Boom methodology) or the m2000rt sample preparation kit (an iron particle-based method). A total of 103 paired plasma and DBS samples were tested. Viral load results were obtained for 97 (94.2%) samples with the Nuclisens isolation kit and 81 (78.6%) samples with the m2000rt kit. The overall correlation between the RNA loads in plasma and DBS was good, although better results were obtained by the Nuclisens test (R(2) = 0.87, P < 0.001) than by the m2000rt test (R(2) = 0.70, P < 0.001). While the specificities were excellent and similar for both the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests (97.1% and 100%, respectively), the sensitivity was greater by the Nuclisens test than by the m2000rt test (75.8% and 56.6%, respectively). Overall, the viral loads in DBS tended to be lower than those in plasma, with mean differences of 0.3 log unit (standard deviation, 0.5 log unit) and 0.76 log unit (standard deviation, 0.8 log unit) for the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests, respectively. The levels of agreement between the measurements in plasma and DBS were assessed by using the Bland-Altman plot for each assay. The Nuclisens test gave results within its defined limits (-0.65 to 1.26) for 95.9% of the samples, while the m2000rt test gave results within its limits (-0.83 to 2.33) for 100% of the samples. In summary, the HIV-1 load can accurately be quantified by testing DBS by either the Nuclisens or the m2000rt test, although the Nuclisens test may outperform the m2000rt test when nucleic acids are extracted manually."
4934,0.005,1.0000,"Recognition and diagnosis of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the primary care setting presents an opportunity for patient education and health promotion. Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients. The decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should be guided by consultation with an HIV specialist."

9124,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleos(t)ide analog therapy blocks DNA synthesis by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase and can control the infection, but treatment is life-long and has high costs and unpredictable long-term side effects. The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently, more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication, but it has not been exploited, primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty, we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM, the best compounds had low micromolar IC(50) values against the RNAseH, and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM. Recombinant HBV genotype D RNAseH was more sensitive to inhibition than genotype H. This study demonstrates that recombinant HBV RNAseH suitable for low-throughput antiviral drug screening has been produced. The high percentage of compounds developed against the HIV RNAseH and integrase that were active against the HBV RNAseH indicates that the extensive drug design efforts against these HIV enzymes can guide anti-HBV RNAseH drug discovery. Finally, differential inhibition of HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs indicates that viral genetic variability will be a factor during drug development."
6755,0.005,1.0000,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."

7444,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."

The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of the anti retroviral therapy 157 patients receiving antiretroviral treatment for at least a twelve month-period and presenting AIDS symptoms based on revised CDC criteria were included. The average number of initial T4 lymphocytes is 133/mm3 (extremes 1 and 385) and the initial plasmatic average viral load, quantified in 96 patients is 214,000 copies (extreme 30,000 et 999,000) The initial antiretroviral combinations were as follows: ZDV or D4T + LMV + NVP (59.2%); ZDV or D4T + LMV + EFV (28.7%), ZDV or D4T + LMV + IDNV (8.9%); ZDV or D4T + DDI + NVP (3.2%). The results of the study are: observance rate during the first 12 months (84%), antiretroviral therapy taken irregularly (10.8%), early submission of therapy (5.2%), weight gain after 24 months: +18 kgs, clinical response globally positive. The immune response is characterised by an average increase of 353/mm3 of CD4 after 24 months. Among 96 patients tested, the plasmatic viral load was undetectable in 71% of cases after a 12 month-follow up.

4421,0.005,1.0000,"It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population are chronically infected with HCV, as the annual incidence of HCV infection is approximately 3-4 million people. Despite all efforts made to eradicate the HCV infection, after the standard therapy (PegIFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks) only 40-50% of the HCV infected individuals with genotype 1 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). Since our goal today is the eradication of HCV infection, our prior concern has become the identification of predictor factors concerning treatment response. Recent studies such as GWAS have been concerned with the genetic factors and the response to treatment. Recently all interest has been turned towards the demonstration of the host polymorphism located upstream of the IL-28B gene and which is associated with sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon Alfa in combination with ribavirin. Although 2011 comes with the FDA approval of the new triple therapy associating telaprevir/ boceprevir to the standard therapy, a new ethical concern regarding the high costs of this treatment rises the problem of who is the first in line? This is just the beginning of a new quest to further investigate the relationship between the host's polymorphism of the IL-28 gene and the standard and triple therapy in HCV infected individuals in achieving SVR as well as who should receive standard or triple therapy. Determination of the IL-28 polymorphisms may be used together with clinical assessment in order to evaluate patients and to personalize their treatment. The purpose of this paper is to underline the main concerns regarding the goal and endpoints of the HCV therapy, and the relationship of IL-28 in achieving sustained virological response, as well as in pointing out the importance to determine prior to initiating treatment the polymorphism of IL-28 since it is a strong predictor. This is important because it will increase the chances to achieve SVR, it will be cost-effective and reduces adverse effects."
9347,0.005,1.0000,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
3236,0.005,1.0000,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."

T-20 in combination with HAART efficiently inhibits HIV-1 replication, however T-20 resistance has been reported and the number of confirmed resistant-associated mutations is growing. In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."

Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
4660,0.005,1.0000,Hepatitis C virus-related liver disease and its associated complications are steadily emerging health concerns in persons co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The increasing number of liver-related deaths in human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus co-infected individuals supports the compelling argument for more aggressive treatment in these patients. The safety and efficacy of interferon/ribavirin in human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients is currently under evaluation. Despite well-documented concern over highly active antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatotoxicity human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis C virus co-infected patients should be offered antiretroviral therapy. Since management of co-infected patients is complex a multidisciplinary approach is needed in order to facilitate care and help patients to achieve a positive outcome.

We studied the lung disease features associated with AIDS in children and adolescents, in an era of ineffective antiretroviral therapy, between January 1996 and October 1998. This prospective, descriptive, longitudinal and historical medical chart review included 48 vertically HIV infected patients, receiving mono or double antiretroviral therapy, who had developed pulmonary disease. Those who presented acute pneumonia were classified into group 1; radiological changes for >or=3 months into group 2; those from group 1 and 2 who underwent lung biopsy into group 3. A rapidly progressive clinical course was found in 70.7% of the children and 37.5% younger than 6 months old. Bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in all patients. High resolution chest computer tomographic scans (HRCT) from 27 patients showed a reticulonodular pattern in 8, ground-glass in 3, reticular in 3, nodular in 3, airspace consolidation in 3, mediastinal adenopathy in 3, pulmonary air cystic in 2 and air-trapping in 1. In five patients the HRCT were normal. Histopathology revealed: lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis in 5 patients, pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia in 9, tuberculosis in 1, interstitial pneumonia in 1, diffuse alveolar damage in 1. Two patients had Cryptococcus neoformans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We conclude that lung diseases were the major risk factor for high morbidity, and an invasive diagnostic procedure may clarify the main cause for similar radiologic images of infectious and non-infectious processes."
775,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) liver function in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are significantly associated. A comparison of clinical significance of fecal HBV DNA and serum HBV DNA has not yet been reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS Stool and serum samples were collected from 66 patients with CHB. Fecal HBV DNA, serum HBV DNA, and intestinal microbiota DNA were detected by real-time quantitative fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Liver function and HBeAg were analyzed. RESULTS The stool and serum HBV DNA were positively correlated (r=0.57, P=0.001). Fecal HBV DNA was higher in the HBeAg-positive group than in the HBeAg-negative group (P=0.02). Fecal HBV DNA was negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (r=-0.41, P=0.001) and TBIL (r=-0.29, P=0.02), and was positively correlated with Enterococcus (r=0.38, P=0.002). Serum HBV DNA was negatively correlated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (r=-0.30,P=0.02), aminotransferase (AST) (r=-0.26, P=0.049), and Lactobacillus (r=-0.31, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS These observations suggest that fecal HBV DNA and serum HBV DNA in patients with CHB have different effects. Fecal HBV DNA might be associated with changes in Enterococcus concentrations, but serum HBV DNA is not. "
6526,0.005,1.0000,"A sensitive chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay has been developed for hepatitis B virus (HBV) core-related antigen (HBcrAg) detection. We aimed to investigate the usefulness of HBcrAg measurement for monitoring chronic hepatitis B disease. HBcrAg levels were measured by a chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay in 54 untreated patients and 39 patients treated with either entecavir or lamivudine. The HBcrAg concentration correlated positively with the levels of serum HBV DNA (r = 0.820), intrahepatic total HBV DNA (r = 0.700), and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (r = 0.664; for all, P values were <0.001). A higher HBcrAg concentration was associated with a greater proportion of hepatitis B core antigen immunostaining. Although the differences were not statistically significant, patients with higher Knodell necroinflammation and fibrosis scores tended to have higher serum HBcrAg concentration levels. In the treated patients, the logarithmic reduction in HBcrAg at week 48 correlated positively with the logarithmic reduction of serum HBV DNA, intrahepatic total HBV DNA, and cccDNA. Of the 31 patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA (<300 copies/ml) at the end of treatment, 20 (65%) still had detectable HBcrAg. A greater reduction in posttreatment HBcrAg concentration was associated with histological improvement and a decrease in hepatitis B core antigen immunostaining. HBcrAg concentrations of <40,000 kU/ml at baseline and <200 kU/ml at week 24 were associated with a higher chance of having undetectable HBV DNA at week 48. In conclusion, serum HBcrAg levels correlated with HBV virological markers and reflected the chronic hepatitis B disease activity in the liver."
4410,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health concern, and the development of curative therapeutics is urgently needed. Such efforts are impeded by the lack of a physiologically relevant, pre-clinical animal model of HBV infection. Here, we report that expression of the HBV entry receptor, human sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP), on macaque primary hepatocytes facilitates HBV infection in vitro, where all replicative intermediates including covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) are present. Furthermore, viral vector-mediated expression of hNTCP on hepatocytes in vivo renders rhesus macaques permissive to HBV infection. These in vivo macaque HBV infections are characterized by longitudinal HBV DNA in serum, and detection of HBV DNA, RNA, and HBV core antigen (HBcAg) in hepatocytes. Together, these results show that expressing hNTCP on macaque hepatocytes renders them susceptible to HBV infection, thereby establishing a physiologically relevant model of HBV infection to study immune clearance and test therapeutic and curative approaches."

1051,0.005,1.0000,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient in 2007 has the option to commence an antiretroviral regimen that is extremely efficacious in suppressing the virus and has few side effects. In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."
5939,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy has enabled constant progress in reducing HIV-1 replication, in some patients who are ""aviremic"" during treatment, the problem of insufficient immune restoration remains, and this exposes them to the risk of immune deficiency-associated pathologies. Various mechanisms may combine and account for this impaired immunologic response to treatment. A first possible mechanism is immune activation, which may be because of residual HIV production, microbial translocation, co-infections, immunosenescence, or lymphopenia per se. A second mechanism is ongoing HIV replication. Finally, deficient thymus output, sex, and genetic polymorphism influencing apoptosis may impair immune reconstitution. In this review we will discuss the tools at our disposal to identify the various mechanisms at work in a given patient and the specific therapeutic strategies we could propose based on this etiologic diagnosis."
2463,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C is found in approximately a third of patients infected with HIV. Therapy of hepatitis C in HIV patients is very important from several view points. First, hepatitis C in the setting of immunosuppression may progress faster, although recent data show that mortality from liver disease was decreased in highly active antiretroviral therapy. HIV/hepatitis C coinfection is associated with more frequent elevation in liver tests (drug-induced liver injury) during highly active antiretroviral therapy, and in some studies, hepatitis C has been associated with lower CD4+ recoveries. The therapeutic standard of care is a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin at a fixed dose, 800 mg/day, although higher ribavirin doses may further improve virologic outcomes. In patients that do not respond virologically, maintenance therapy with peginterferon monotherapy is a potential avenue to stem the advance of liver fibrosis, although controlled data in coinfected patients are needed to issue formal recommendations."
5488,0.005,1.0000,"CD4 T-cell-specific memory antiviral responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were investigated in 16 patients with documented primary HIV-1 infection (4 of the 16 subjects also had primary CMV infection) and compared with those observed in patients with chronic HIV-1 and CMV coinfection. Virus-specific memory CD4 T cells were characterized on the basis of the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7. HIV-1- and CMV-specific interferon-gamma-secreting CD4 T cells were detected in patients with primary and chronic HIV-1 and CMV coinfection and were mostly contained in the cell population lacking expression of CCR7. The magnitude of the primary CMV-specific CD4 T-cell response was significantly greater than that of chronic CMV infection, whereas there were no differences between primary and chronic HIV-1-specific CD4 T-cell responses. A substantial proportion of CD4(+)CCR7(-) T cells were infected with HIV-1. These results advance the characterization of antiviral memory CD4 T-cell response and the delineation of the potential mechanisms that likely prevent the generation of a robust CD4 T-cell immune response during primary infection."
3156,0.005,1.0000,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."
2797,0.005,1.0000,"Biphasic plasma viral decays were modeled in 48 patients treated with ritonavir, zidovudine, and lamivudine. Estimated first- and second-phase decay rates were d1 as 0.47/day and d2 as 0.04/day. Interpatient differences in both decay rates were significant. The d1 was directly correlated with baseline CD4+, CD4+CD28+, and CD8+CD28+ T lymphocyte counts (P<.05) and inversely correlated with baseline virus load (P=.044) and the magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte recovery (P<.01). The d2 was directly correlated with baseline percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes (P=.023), the CD8+CD38+ cell number (P=.024), and the level of IgG that binds to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 gp120 (P=.02). Viral decay rates were not predictive of treatment failure or durability of viral suppression. These exploratory findings are consistent with a model in which immunologic factors contribute to elimination of HIV-infected cells and suggest a dynamic interplay between regulation of HIV expression and lymphocyte activation and recovery."
3548,0.005,1.0000,"To evaluate factors associated with durable viral suppression (DVS), low viral rebound (virus load of 500-5000 copies/mL), and high viral rebound (virus load above 5000 copies/mL), we studied 3736 patients who achieved an undetectable virus load (i.e., <500 copies/mL) while receiving an initial highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI). A total of 2636 patients (71%) had DVS, 387 (10%) had low viral rebound, and 713 (19%) had high viral rebound. Factors associated with DVS were antiretroviral-naive status, choice of PI (indinavir or boosted PI), lower virus load and higher CD4+ cell count, shorter duration of therapy (<6 months), and larger CD4+ cell increment until an undetectable virus load was attained. These factors (except for receipt of indinavir) were also associated with low versus high viral rebound. Compared with patients with DVS, patients with high viral rebound were more likely to experience clinical failure (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-3.02) and immunologic failure (aHR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.34-1.83), and patients with low viral rebound were as likely to experience these types of failure (aHR for clinical failure, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.48-2.92]; aHR for immunologic failure, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87-1.32]), suggesting that a low viral rebound while receiving HAART that contains a PI has no significant consequence on midterm clinical outcome."
7794,0.005,1.0000,"Studies examining the sex differences in morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis of sex differences in disease progression and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. Medical literature databases from inception to August 2014 were searched for published observational studies assessing sex differences in immunologic and virologic response, disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Random effects meta-analyses of 115 eligible studies were conducted to obtain pooled estimates of outcomes and heterogeneity was explored in sub-group analyses. Pooled estimates showed an increased risk of progression to AIDS (relative risk [RR]=1.11,95% CI=1.02-1.21) and all-cause mortality (RR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.29) among males compared to females. All-cause mortality differed by sex only in low and middle income countries. The risk of AIDS-related mortality (RR=1.03, 95% CI=0.82-1.30), immunologic failure (RR=1.19,95% CI: 0.97-1.47), virologic suppression (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.84-1.14), virologic failure (RR=1.26, 95% CI=0.99-1.61) and the change in CD4 cell count (Weighted mean difference [WMD] = -5.15, 95% CI= -13.57 to 3.28) did not differ by sex. These findings were modified by disease severity, adherence and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that HIV-related disease progression and survival outcomes are poorer in males. "
6126,0.005,1.0000,"Vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the setting of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is recommended, but responses to vaccination are blunted when compared to uninfected populations. The mechanism for this failure of immune response in HCV-infected subjects remains unknown but is thought to be a result of lymphocyte dysfunction during chronic viral infection. We have recently demonstrated that PD-1, a novel negative immunomodulator for T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, is involved in T and B lymphocyte dysregulation during chronic HCV infection. In this report, we further investigated the role of the PD-1 pathway in regulation of CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in HCV-infected individuals. In a prospective HCV infected cohort, a poor response rate to HBV vaccination as assayed by seroconversion was observed in HCV-infected subjects (53%), while a high response rate was observed in healthy or spontaneously HCV-resolved individuals (94%). CD4(+) T cell responses to ex vivo stimulations of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were found to be lower in HBV vaccine non-responders compared to those responders in HCV-infected individuals who had received a series of HBV immunizations. PD-1 expression on CD4(+) T cells was detected at relatively higher levels in these HBV vaccine non-responders than those who responded, and this was inversely associated with the cell activation status. Importantly, blocking the PD-1 pathway improved T cell activation and proliferation in response to ex vivo HBsAg or anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in HBV vaccine non-responders. These results suggest that PD-1 signaling may be involved in impairing CD4(+) T cell responses to HBV vaccination in subjects with HCV infection, and raise the possibility that blocking this negative signaling pathway might improve success rates of immunization in the setting of chronic viral infection."

IL-2 was detectable (level >8.7 pg/mL) in the serum of 28 of 45 HIV-infected children; 42% (19 of 45) had serum IL-2 levels of >39 pg/mL. Children without evidence of immunosuppression (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Pediatric HIV Classification Immunologic Category 1, n = 15) and children with severe immunosuppression (immunologic category 3, n = 20) had statistically significant lower serum IL-2 levels (mean +/- [SD], 134.4 +/- 227.3 pg/mL and 18.2 +/- 30.3 pg/mL, respectively) than those with moderate immunosuppression (mean +/- [SD], 450.5 +/- 311.8 pg/ml; immunologic category 2, n = 10) (P < .05, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In those children in whom immunosuppression was evident, decreasing serum IL-2 levels correlated with depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes (r = 0.74), whereas there was an inverse correlation between serum IL-2 levels and CD4+ lymphocyte counts (r = -0.47) in children with no or moderate immunosuppression."
8572,0.005,1.0000,"HIV infection is the major public health, social and economic problem in Georgia. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."
3539,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 DNA and RNA levels and T lymphocyte cell surface markers were measured in blood serum and cell fractions from asymptomatic infected patients to find novel virologic and immunologic features in early disease predictive of subsequent clinical disease course. Thirty-two patients with rapid disease progression (rapid CD4+ cell loss and progression to clinical AIDS) were compared with 25 patients with stable infections (constant or rising CD4+ cell counts, no clinical disease manifestations). All HIV-1 burdens measured by polymerase chain reaction were consistently higher in specimens from rapid progressors than slow progressors. For each patient, virus burden remained relatively constant throughout the study period (mean, 42-44 months). Flow cytometry also disclosed stable lymphocyte immunophenotype patterns that correlated strongly with subsequent rapid progression to clinical disease. Thus, in early HIV-1 infection, a constellation of high virus burden and in vivo costimulatory antigen and lymphocyte activation abnormalities is predictive of rapid disease course."
3014,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide and only a minority of treated patients develop a sustained protective response following a short course of therapy, and most patients require prolonged treatment to suppress viral replication. However, several recent reports showed that inhibition of certain host cell proteins prevented viral infection, specifically the human abhydrolase domain containing 2 (ABHD2) has been confirmed by our previous study to be upregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells but downregulated by lamivudine. These observations suggested that ABHD2 was important for HBV propagation and could be a target of novel anti-HBV drugs. To assess the importance of ABHD2 to the HBV infection process, antisense oligonucleotides (ASODNs) were used to downregulate ABHD2 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. From 5 ASODNS candidates tested, AB3 significantly downregulated ABHD2 mRNA and protein expression levels. Further, AB3 significantly reduced HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B ""e"" antigen protein expression levels in cell medium without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that downregulation of ABHD2 using ASODNs blocked HBV replication and expression without affecting host cell physiology. Further, data demonstrated an essential role of ABHD2 in HBV propagation, suggesting it can serve as a novel target for anti-HBV drug development."
1949,0.005,1.0000,"Fas/Fas Ligand (FasL) interactions play a significant role in peripheral T lymphocyte homeostasis and in certain pathological states characterized by T cell depletion. In this study, we demonstrate that antigen-presenting cells such as monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM) but not monocyte-derived dendritic cells express basal levels of FasL. HIV infection of MDM increases FasL protein expression independent of posttranslational mechanisms, thus highlighting the virus-induced transcriptional upregulation of FasL. The in vitro relevance of these observations is confirmed in human lymphoid tissue. FasL protein expression is constitutive and restricted to tissue macrophages and not dendritic cells. Moreover, a significant increase in macrophage-associated FasL is observed in lymphoid tissue from HIV (+) individuals (P < 0.001), which is further supported by increased levels of FasL mRNA using in situ hybridization. The degree of FasL protein expression in vivo correlates with the degree of tissue apoptosis (r = 0.761, P < 0. 001), which is significantly increased in tissue from HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001). These results identify human tissue macrophages as a relevant source for FasL expression in vitro and in vivo and highlight the potential role of FasL expression in the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection."
9554,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the overall clinical expression characteristics of the cluster of differentiation (CD)28 family receptors [CD28, inducible T-cell co-stimulator, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‑1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and B‑ and T-lymphocyte attenuator] on T cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), analyze the correlations among these receptors and the clinical parameters, and to investigate the effects of PD‑1 blockade on the receptor expression profiles, T‑cell function and other biological effects. The expression characteristics of the CD28 family of receptors, the effects of PD‑1 blockade on the receptor expression profiles and the levels of interferon (IFN)‑γ were investigated in the T cells of patients with CHB. In addition, the transcription factor, T‑box 21 (T‑bet) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA‑3) mRNA expression levels were investigated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with CHB. The expression levels of the CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB demonstrated distinct characteristics , for example levels of PD‑1 and CTLA‑4 on CD4 T cells and ICOS, PD‑1, and BTLA on CD8 T cells were increased in cells from patients with CHB compared with those from the healthy individuals. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated among the serum HBV DNA titers and the levels of PD‑1 on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of PD‑1 corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. A significant positive correlation was observed between the serum HBV DNA titers and the expression levels of BTLA on CD8+ T cells with the highest expression of BTLA corresponding to viral levels >106 IU/ml. PD‑1 blockade altered the expression profiles of CD28 family receptors in the T cells of patients with CHB, partly enhanced T cell function and increased the ratio of T‑bet/GATA‑3 mRNA in PBMCs. Thus, CD28 family receptors are potential clinical indicators for the rapid monitoring of changes in T cell function during CHB treatment. Furthermore, PD‑1 blockade has a therapeutic potential that may be enhanced by modulating the expression of co-stimulatory and -inhibitory receptors of the CD28 family. "
1387,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lymphocyte P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and genotype in vivo and the expression of lymphocyte receptors critical in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), i.e., CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. Using flow cytometry to quantify each membrane receptor/transporter, we demonstrate a highly significant correlation between P-gp protein expression and the expression of CXCR4 (rho = 0.874; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, confocal microscopy showed colocalized expression of CXCR4 and P-gp in the lymphocyte membrane. This significant relationship was also apparent at the mRNA level by use of reverse transcription-PCR (rho = 0.61; P < 0.005) and was present in both phytohemagglutinin-stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Genotypic analysis of the C3435T single-nucleotide polymorphism of P-gp confirmed significantly higher levels of P-gp in C (range, 2.45 to 11.00 relative fluorescence units [RFU])- than in T (range, 0.25 to 5.00 RFU)-homozygous individuals (P = 0.0088; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7 to 6.3 RFU). An equivalent association between CXCR4 levels and C (range, 12.7 to 44.1 RFU) versus T (range, 3 to 18.9 RFU) genotype was also demonstrated (P = 0.0019; 95% CI, 5.4 to 23.7). Functionally, although these correlates had no impact on HIV-1 production from either X4- or R5-tropic virus, expression correlated significantly with the activity of the HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI) saquinavir for both P-gp (rho = 0.75; P = 0.0019) and CXCR4 (rho = 0.71; P = 0.0041). This study defines an association between P-gp (expression and genotype) and CXCR4 that may have implications for the selection of viral tropism and the access of drugs to protease for specific tropic types. The interplay between these two proteins may also influence the viral genotypes which escape effective chemotherapy and which therefore have the opportunity to evolve resistance to PIs."

We found that the compounds were effective inhibitors of HBV, both in vitro and in vivo. All of the compounds showed suppressive activity on the expression of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV e antigen (HBeAg) in the HepG2.2.15 cell line with low cytotoxicity.

Subtype C predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for the majority of worldwide HIV-1 infections, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, and subtype E is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Significant amino acid variations have been observed among the clade-specific Tat proteins. For the present study, we examined clade-specific interactions between Tat, transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, and P-TEFb proteins and how these interactions may modulate the efficiency of HIV-1 transcription. Clade-specific Tat proteins significantly modified viral gene expression. Tat proteins derived from HIV-1 clades C and E were strong transactivators of long terminal repeat (LTR) activity; Tat E also had a longer half-life than the other Tat proteins and interacted more efficiently with the stem-loop TAR element. Chimeric Tat proteins harboring the Tat E activation domain were strong transactivators of LTR expression. While Tat B, C, and E were able to rescue a Tat-defective HIV-1 proviral clone, Tat E was significantly more efficient at rescue than Tat C, possibly due to the relative stability of the Tat protein. Swapping the activation domains of Tat B, C, and E identified the cyclin T1 association domain as a critical determinant of the transactivation efficiency and of Tat-defective HIV-1 provirus rescue."
1017,0.005,1.0000,"Disruption of the linkage among the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems may contribute to the pathology and symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We investigated the role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in altering these linkages via induction of corticotropin (ACTH) by lymphocytes. Cultured T lymphocytes (H9 cell line) were infected with HIV-1, after which ACTH production was measured and characterized at various time intervals by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. We report a coordinate expression of ACTH and p24 HIV core protein in H9 cells. Also, the kinetics of HIV-induced ACTH production by H9 T lymphoma cells are demonstrated using three different strains of HIV as well as UV-inactivated HIV. ACTH production corresponded with the appearance of p24 antigen and was maximal 35 days after infection. UV-inactivated HIV and the viral envelope protein, gp120, were also able to induce ACTH production in these cells, indicating that viral replication was not required for the ACTH induction. The HIV-induced ACTH was synthesized de novo and had the size and biological activity of pituitary ACTH. Inhibition of ACTH in HIV-infected lymphocyte cultures by anti-ACTH antiserum enhanced viral p24 expression. The significance of lymphocyte ACTH in AIDS is not clear, but these results suggest that it may restrict HIV replication and possibly infection."

The nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte counts were not different between the HAV-positive and -negative groups (197 ± 138 vs 202 ± 129, P = 0.821). The only factor independently associated with seropositive status was age under 40 yr old (OR 0.017, P < 0.001).

E1B 19K protein expression inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis, enhanced virus production, and established high levels of persistent viral infection. One E1B 19K-expressing line appeared to undergo HIV-induced death via a nonapoptotic mechanism, illustrating that HIV infection results in lymphocyte depletion through multiple pathways. Increased virus production associated with sustained cell viability suggests that therapeutic approaches involving inhibition of HIV-induced programmed cell death may be problematic."
2093,0.005,1.0000,"Substance P (SP), a member of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, is an important immunomodulator of lymphocyte and monocyte/macrophage function. We have examined the effects of SP on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in vitro. Human monocytes isolated by Ficoll gradient followed by adherence were maintained in vitro for 10 days and infected with HIV-1. The addition of SP resulted in a 2- to 8-fold-enhanced HIV-1 expression in the MDMs isolated from 7 of 13 healthy donors as determined by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and p24 protein expression assays, as compared to control cultures incubated with HIV-1 alone. There was no correlation observed, however, between SP-stimulated TNF production and HIV-1 expression in MDMs obtained from a subset of these donors. These effects of SP on HIV-1 expression in MDMs in vitro may have in vivo implications relevant to modulation of monocyte/macrophage functions, to HIV-1 infection of monocytes/macrophages, and to the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection."

The Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database was interrogated and showed that 23% of patients treated with nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) had mutations at codon 69. These variants included T69N, -S, -A, -G, -E, -I, and -K mutations that were present in patients treated with NRTI but not in drug-naive patients. Treatment history information showed that a substantial percentage of these codon 69 changes occurred in patients administered non-ddC-containing regimens. Different and specific patterns of other RT gene mutations were associated with the various codon 69 mutations. Drug susceptibility assays showed that viral constructs containing codon 69 variants could have reduced susceptibility to ddC and other RT inhibitors. These results suggest that the T69D mutation is not the only codon 69 variant associated with drug resistance and that ddC is not the only drug affected."

We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."

A better understanding of the activity of approved and investigational NRTIs against HIV-1(65R) is needed to select optimal therapy for patients infected with this mutant and to devise strategies to prevent its emergence. Therefore, we tested a broad panel of NRTIs that differed by enantiomer, pseudosugar, and base component against HIV-1(65R) to determine how NRTI structure affects activity. Drug susceptibilities of recombinant wild-type (HIV-1(65K)) or mutant HIV-1(65R) were determined using a single-replication-cycle susceptibility assay with P4/R5 cells and/or a multiple-replication-cycle susceptibility assay with MT-2 cells. All D, L, and acyclic NRTIs were significantly less active against HIV-1(65R) than against HIV-1(65K) except for analogs containing a 3'-azido moiety. Pseudosugar structure and base component but not enantiomer influenced NRTI activity against HIV-1(65R). These findings support the inclusion of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine in drug combinations to treat patients having HIV-1(65R) and to prevent its emergence."

From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."
4757,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of drug resistance mutations induced by nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NRTI) on cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1(LAI)) RT was addressed in 35 treated or untreated patients. Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."
554,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations in the core promoter and precore regions are frequently found in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients, but precore stop codon mutation is restricted to hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes that have T at nucleotide 1858. The aims of this study were to determine the role of core promoter and/or precore mutations in HBeAg seroconversion and their impact on the subsequent course of liver disease, and to determine if core promoter mutations are more frequently selected in patients with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation. Serial sera from 45 patients with chronic HBV infection were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the HBV core promoter and precore regions were sequenced. Ninety-two percent of patients had core promoter or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion: 42% had core promoter changes only, 38% had precore stop codon mutations only, and 12% had changes in both regions. Seventy-three percent of the patients had persistently normal aminotransferases, and only 8% had multiple flares in aminotransferases after HBeAg seroconversion. Core promoter changes were significantly more common in patients infected with HBV who have C at nucleotide 1858 (91% vs. 27%; P <.01), while precore stop codon changes were exclusively found in patients infected with HBV who have T at nucleotide 1858 (87% vs. 0; P <.01). The vast majority of our patients had core promoter and/or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion. Nevertheless, most patients had sustained remission of liver disease. Our data suggest that core promoter changes are preferentially selected in patients infected with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation."
9053,0.005,1.0000,"The impact of antiretroviral drug exposure and associated lipodystrophy and/or insulin resistance (IR) on advanced liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is not fully documented. We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ≥9.5 kPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."
7768,0.005,1.0000,"The safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea with didanosine in combination with stavudine in nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced patients was investigated. Entry criteria included HIV-1 infected, NRTI-experienced adults, with CD4(+) counts 50-550 cells/mm(3) and viral loads >or=12,500 copies/mL. Subjects were treated with didanosine 200 mg twice a day (BID), stavudine 40 mg BID, and hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily for 16 weeks. Thirty-one HIV-1 subjects with mean bDNA viral load 1x10(5) log(10) copies/mL and mean CD4(+) T-cell counts of 231 cells/mm(3) were enrolled. A 1.3 log(10) decrease in mean viral load was seen at 12 weeks of therapy. Prior didanosine use resulted in a more rapid response to therapy compared with prior zidovudine use. Side effects consisting of neutropenia, pancreatitis, and peripheral neuropathy occurred in four subjects and resolved upon withdrawal of therapy. This non-randomized study in subjects with a mean CD4(+) T-cell count of 230 cells/mm(3) demonstrates the antiviral activity of hydroxyurea+didanosine and stavudine. Toxicities related to therapy need to be followed closely. The results support the need for a randomized, prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea plus didanosine in antiretroviral-experienced patients with CD4(+) cell counts below 300 cells/mm(3)."

However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."

Clinical manifestation, electronic microscopic examination of erythrocytes, and histopathology of a papule biopsy suggested a Bartonella sp. infection. Multiple genes were target by PCR and B. henselae DNA was amplified and sequenced (GenBank accession number EF196804) from the angiomatous papule.

HIV causes chronic progressive disease that leads to early death. Newer combination antiretro viral treatments are effective but expensive and difficult to use. The HIV Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (HIV-QUERI) uses the QUERI process to identify high-risk and high-volume populations (step 1), which includes those already under VHA care for HIV, those who do not know of their infection, and those at risk for HIV. In identifying best practices (step 2), the HIV-QUERI will benefit greatly from existing guidelines for the care of established HIV infection, but gaps in knowledge regarding adherence to medication regimens and cost-effective screening are large. To identify existing practice patterns (step 3), the HIV-QUERI will develop a clean analytic data set based on Immunology Case Registry files and expand it through a survey of veterans. Interventions to improve care (step 4) will include national, regional, and site-specific feedback on performance relative to quality standards, as well as patient-level and provider-level interventions to improve adherence and support medical decision-making. To document that best practices improve outcomes and quality of life (steps 5 and 6), HIV-QUERI will track indicators on an ongoing basis by use of the Immunology Case Registry database and possible future waves of the survey. In addition, we will require that these issues be addressed in evaluations of HIV-QUERI interventions. In the present article, we present these steps within a framework and plan."

To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."

We conducted a cross-sectional survey (n = 200) among patients registered at Odessa AIDS centers in October to December 2011. Factors associated with delayed enrollment in HIV care (>3 months since positive HIV test) were evaluated using logistic regression. Among study participants (mean age 35 ± 8.2 years, 47.5% female, 42.5% reported history of injecting drugs), 55% delayed HIV care enrollment. Odds of delayed enrollment were higher for those with lower educational attainment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-6.76), not feeling ill (aOR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.50-5.93), or not having time to go to the AIDS center (aOR: 3.89, 95% CI: 1.39-10.89); injection drug use was not associated with delayed enrollment. Programs linking HIV-positive individuals to specialized care should address enrollment barriers and include education on HIV care benefits and case management for direct linkage to care. HIV testing and treatment should be coupled to ensure a continuum of care."
2388,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) continues to cause a major impact worldwide. HIV-induced lung disease continues to represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality, although the spectrum of pulmonary diseases has changed. HIV significantly affects the lung, causing acute and chronic cellular changes in the alveolar space. The impact of ART on lung immunology still needs to be fully elucidated. Similar to the periphery, ART affects HIV viral load and reconstitutes CD4(+) T cells in the lung. ART has been associated with significant decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes and increases in B-cell numbers and functionality, resulting in improved immune responses to vaccinations. There are substantial clinical implications of these ART-induced alterations, including the emergence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and the increased incidences of noninfectious lung diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. There continues to be many unanswered questions regarding the effects of ART on lung health and, in particular, the immune system. Growing knowledge in this area will hopefully diminish the incidence of these noninfectious lung diseases and further improve the health of individuals living with HIV. "
3529,0.005,1.0000,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."

Predisposing risk factors for ADRs were identified. ADRs were included if they occurred during or within 1 week following the discontinuation of pentamidine treatment. Nephrotoxicity, dysglycemia, hepatotoxicity, hyperkalemia, and hyperamylasemia accounted for 80% of ADRs (n = 174) that occurred in 76 (71.7%) of 106 patients during 84 treatment courses of pentamidine. A significant relationship between hypoglycemia and nephrotoxicity was observed (P = .002). Four factors were significantly associated with occurrence of an ADR: number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36, P = .005), nonwhite ethnicity (OR = 5.00, P = .017), cumulative dosage of pentamidine (OR = 1.03, P = .030), and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs (OR = 2.34, P = .047). Two factors, daily dosage and history of intravenous drug use, approached significance. Knowledge of and avoidance of potential risk factors might allow safer use of pentamidine and reduce the prevalence of ADRs."

In this study, 27 HIV-infected patients (Walter Reed Staging Classification I-V) with normal chest roentgenograms were evaluated to determine the occurrence of thoracic gallium abnormalities in early HIV infection. SPECT was used for gallium scanning. Patients received gallium injection on day 1 and bronchoalveolar lavage on day 2, and scanning was performed on day 3. Twenty-eight scans in 27 patients were performed. Mean nodal SPECT activity was compared with corresponding values for lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, and peripheral blood T4 lymphocyte counts. No relationship between nodal and parenchymal activity and cell counts was observed. Although visual scan interpretation was unaffected, gallium activity was significantly increased in the region of bronchoalveolar lavage compared with uptake in other lung regions. It is concluded that SPECT gallium scanning demonstrates significant gallium avidity in recently lavaged lung areas, although no impact on visual scan interpretation was seen. Further, no correlation was seen between the degree of nodal uptake and the immunologic status of these patients with early HIV infection."

Surface CD4 protein was detected on these cells, and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) blocked infection, indicating that HIV infection was mediated by the cell surface CD4 protein. In contrast, infection of human primary chondrocyte cells (C23), synovial cells (HSA), and foreskin fibroblasts (F13) was apparently independent of cell CD4-mediated mechanisms. Surface CD4 protein could not be detected on these cells, and sCD4 did not block the infection. F13 cells could be infected only by HIV-2, not by HIV-1, under our experimental conditions. In cells of mesenchymal orgin, viral production could be detected only after cocultivation with the human T-lymphoid H9 cells but not by conventional viral assays, including reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen assays in cell culture supernatant and immunofluorescence of host cells. Our DNA transfection studies indicated that this lack of detectable viral production was not due to the inefficient use of the HIV long terminal repeat or the Tat protein in these cells. These mesenchymal and epithelial cells were susceptible to HIV infection but differed in mechanism of virus entry compared with hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes. These observations may provide insights into clinical syndromes such as lung dysfunction in HIV-infected newborns and connective tissue disorders in HIV-infected adults."

A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."
1750,0.005,1.0000,"We recently showed HLA-B35-restricted CTL activity for 10 HIV-1 epitopes in PBL from two HIV-1-infected individuals. In the present study, we established CTL clones specific for nine of these HIV-1 epitopes to confirm these HLA-B35-restricted epitopes. The specific CTL clones effectively killed the HLA-B*3501-positive target cells infected with the HIV-1 vaccinia recombinant virus. These results confirmed that nine HIV-1 CTL epitopes are presented by HLA-B*3501 molecules. The CTL activity specific for four Pol and two Nef epitopes was induced in the peptide-stimulated PBL from three or more of seven HIV-1-infected individuals, indicating that these six are common epitopes. Eight were considered strong epitopes because the specific CTL activity was detected in the cultured PBL that was once stimulated with peptides. Thus, the present study excluded the possibility that the disability of the presentation of HIV-1 epitopes by HLA-B35 molecules is associated with the accelerated progression of AIDS in HLA-B35-positive individuals. Analysis of mutated epitopes found in an HIV-1 type B strain using the CTL clones revealed that most mutated epitopes partially or markedly affect the recognition of CTL clones. Of 19 mutations that affected recognition of the CTL clones, 7 reduced peptide-HLA-B*3501 binding, while 12 affected TCR recognition. These results indicate that natural mutations of HLA-B35-restricted HIV-1 CTL epitopes affect the recognition of CTL by mechanisms that reduce both peptide binding and TCR recognition."
4043,0.005,1.0000,"The ""natural killer"" (NK) cells preferentially kill targets lacking surface major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule expression. NK cells recognize these targets through membrane receptors, which can trigger activating or inhibitory signals for killing. Several tumors or virus-infected cells downregulate MHC-I expression as a mechanism to evade recognition and killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). They, however, become targets for NK cells cytotoxic activity. NK cell activity is reduced during disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and in individuals with AIDS-associated tumors linked with infection by the oncogenic human herpes virus type-8 (HHV8), including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). We have demonstrated that AIDS-related KS (AIDS-KS) is characterized by an increased expression of inhibitory receptors by T lymphocytes, and that HIV-non-infected patients with KS (classic KS, C-KS) have a substantial number of NK cells bearing these same receptors. NK cells from patients with C-KS are normally equipped with cytolytic molecules including granzyme A and perforin. However, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is reduced in patients with C-KS, AIDS-KS, or PEL patients, who are all infected by the HHV8, and this correlates with disease severity. Moreover, we have found that HHV8-infected cell lines established from PELs have a reduced surface expression of MHC-I molecules and are sensitive to the lysis mediated by NK cells. Since PEL cells express the same HHV8 latency program as KS cells, these data point to MHC-I downregulation by HHV8 as a primary immune evasion mechanism against CTL responses, further reinforced by upregulation of inhibitory receptors on T and NK cells in the setting of HIV and/or HHV8 infection. Thus, studies on killing receptor regulation and signaling in T and NK cells may shed light on the pathogenesis of HHV8-associated tumors both in HIV-infected or -noninfected patients."

197,0.005,1.0000,"Clarifying the relationship between illicit drug use and HIV-1 virologic suppression requires characterization of both illicit drug use activity and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed a rapid clinical questionnaire to assess prior 7-day illicit drug use and ART adherence in a cross-sectional study among 1777 HIV-infected persons in care. Of these, 76% were male, 35% were African-American, and 8% reported injection drug use as their probable route of HIV-1 infection. Questionnaire-reported frequencies of cocaine and marijuana use within the previous 7 days were 3.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Over three quarters (77.8%) of participants were on ART, of whom 69.7% had HIV-1 virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA<48 copies/mL). Univariate analyses revealed that compared to no use, cocaine and marijuana use were both associated with missed ART doses (P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for nonadherence demonstrated that cocaine use was independently associated with failing to achieve virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.22-0.98) but marijuana use was not (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.72-1.62).

Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV.

A total of 60 patients (43 male, 17 female) with chronic hepatitis D infection [HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgG positive, anti-HBc IgM negative, total anti-delta positive, anti-HCV negative] and 30 patients (21 male, 9 female) without hepatitis D infection [HBsAg positive, HBeAg negative, anti-HBe positive, anti-HBc IgG positive, anti-HBc IgM negative, total anti-delta negative, anti-HCV negative] as control group were included to the study. ACA IgG and IgM were searched by a commercial microELISA kit (Euroimmun, Germany). The statistical evaluation was performed with Pearson's chi-square test, Student's t-test, and Fisher's exact test. Total ACAs positivity rate of 60 patients with chronic HDV infection, was found as 13.3%, in which four of the patients were positive for only ACA IgM, while four was positive for only IgG. Positivity for both ACA IgG and ACA IgM could not be detected in these patients. No patients in the control group had positivity for ACAs (IgG and/or IgM). A statistically significant difference was observed in terms of ACA positivity between patients with and without HDV infection (p< 0.05). After all, there was no statistically significant correlation between ACAs positivity and the age, sex, and laboratory parameters of the patients with chronic HDV infection, except lower serum albumin levels (p= 0.004). Although the data of this study revealed a statistically significant positive correlation between chronic HDV infection and anticardiolipin antibodies, it is clear that there is a need for further studies on this subject."
5738,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to estimate the presence of hepatitis delta virus RNA in chronically HBV-infected patients from northern Poland. Three out of 63 studied samples (4.8%) were positive in a qualitative test for total antibodies to HDV antigen. Five samples (7.9%) turned out to be HDV-RNA-positive by RT-PCR, four of them were sequenced in the region of L-HDAg, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All four examined samples belonged to genotype I. Two RNA-positive/anti-HD-negative samples possessed a few uncommon nucleotide substitution sites within the L-HDAg sequence, which could suggest unique variants in the Polish population of HDV-infected patients."
6920,0.005,1.0000,"Serum samples obtained from 289 first-time and 114 repeat donors at the Blood Center of Mongolia (MBC) were tested for serological and molecular markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infections. Among the 403 blood donors, 33 (8.2%), 21 (5.2%), and 27 (6.7%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HDV RNA, respectively. Collectively, 55 donors were viremic for one or more of these viruses, and included 54 first-time donors (18.7%) and 1 repeat donor (0.9%) (P < 0.0001). One discrepant case with HBsAg detectable only at MBC was negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc in this study. Four donors who were HCV-viremic in this study were negative for anti-HCV by the MBC method. Further efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the currently-used tests are urgently required in Mongolia. Three donors who were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HDV but negative for HBsAg, had both HBV DNA and HDV RNA. This suggests that introduction of a new anti-HDV serological test is useful for not only HDV screening but also HBV screening of anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg negative donors, considering a possibility of viral interference by coexisting HDV."
3033,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) increases morbidity in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."
7009,0.005,1.0000,"IgM, IgG, and HBsAg containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) were determined, by conglutinin (K) and C1q assays, for assessing the role of CIC in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 54 HBsAg-negative controls and 85 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HDV markers (HDV antigen and anti-HD) was 24.70% (21/85). CIC were a common feature of HDV infection with 95.24% of patients having at least one abnormal test result. The prevalence of elevated IgM-K, IgG-K, IgM-C1q, and IgG-C1q CIC were 85.71, 85.71, 57.14, and 85.71%, respectively. The prevalence of IgM class CIC were statistically higher in patients with HDV infection than in those without (P = .001 for the K assay and P = .023 for the C1q assay). There was no difference in the prevalence of IgG class CIC. Patients with HDV infection also have significantly higher median levels of IgM K-CIC (P = .002), IgG K-CIC (P = .049), and IgG C1q-CIC (P = .008). In patients with HDV infection, there was positive correlation between IgM C1q-CIC and transaminase levels (r = .519, P = .016 for AST; r = .500, P = .021 for ALT). There was no difference in the prevalence of HBsAg containing CIC between patients with HDV infection (76.19%) and those without (74.60%). In conclusion, IgM class CIC are the major CIC and correlate with disease activity in HDV infection. CIC may play a role in the pathogenesis of HDV infection."
8209,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is dependent on the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) for transmission and replication because of its inability to produce its own coat. It remains unclear whether HDV infection increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Outpatient Registry, we identified 9160 patients with chronic HBV infection between 1997 and 2008, of whom 327 had chronic HDV infection and 323 had acute HDV infection. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for these patients compared with the general population. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was greatly increased in patients with HBV and HDV (SIR = 137.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 62.19 to 261.51). The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with HBV and HDV was increased (SIR = 6.11, 95% CI = 2.77 to 11.65) when patients with chronic HBV infection alone were used as the reference population. Similar results were observed for patients with chronic HDV infection (SIR = 99.26, 95% CI = 42.39 to 196.55). Our findings indicate that HDV is a strong risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma."
9239,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of hepatitis virus markers in patients with chronic liver diseases from two countries has been studied: 68 patients (38 alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis, 30 chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis) from Hungary as well as 109 patients (55 alcoholic liver disease, 45 chronic hepatitis or cryptogenic cirrhosis and 9 hepatoma) from Romania were examined for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HDV, using the corresponding Abbott Elisa test systems. In alcoholic liver disease HBsAg occurred in 6/38 patients from Hungary and in 22/55 patients respectively, that is HBV markers occurred with significantly higher frequency in alcoholic patients from Romania (p less than 0.05). In the Hungarian group a total of 36 patients were HBsAg positive and out of them 5 had anti-HDV (13.9%), while out of 21 Romania HBsAg carriers 10 patients had anti-HDV (47.6%). Among 9 hepatoma patients 4 had HBsAg, 6 anti-HBs and 7 anti-HBc and 4 had anti-HCV and 3 had anti-HDV. One patient with hepatoma had both HBsAg and anti-HCV plus anti-HDV as well. Results suggest that the infection with hepatitis viruses in alcoholic liver diseases is more common in Romania than in Hungary, and the prevalence of delta virus infection in HBV carriers is also significantly higher in Romania than in Hungary."
8813,0.005,1.0000,"A previous study revealed a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA among 249 apparently healthy individuals (mean+/-standard deviation age, 48.4+/-13.9 years; 126 males and 123 females) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To investigate further the prevalence of HDV infection there, the same serum samples obtained from the cohort were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant hepatitis delta antigen protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. Anti-HDV was detected in 42 persons (16.9%), among whom 22 (52.4%) were positive for HBsAg and 20 (47.6%) had detectable HDV RNA. Among 170 persons with anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg, 20 (11.8%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 1 of the 20 subjects was positive for HDV RNA. Of note, none of 55 anti-HBc-negative persons had anti-HDV, supporting the specificity of the anti-HDV assay. The optical density (OD) value of anti-HDV was significantly higher among HDV RNA-positive subjects (n=21) than among HDV RNA-negative subjects (n=21) (2.513+/-0.514 vs. 0.836+/-0.550, P<0.0001). The present study confirmed the extremely high prevalence of HDV infection in Mongolia, and identified a person who was positive for both anti-HDV and HDV RNA despite negativity for HBsAg and HBV DNA probably due to viral interference. The anti-HDV assay may be useful for further epidemiological studies on HDV infection in larger cohorts in urban and rural areas of Mongolia, where elucidation of the transmission route of HDV is required urgently."
8664,0.005,1.0000,"Since some hepatitis viruses and the human immunodeficiency viruses share common modes of transmission, such as the sexual route, we undertook to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to these and other pathogens among 384 rural pregnant women. Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."

Emerging data from studies of these individuals and other uninfected individuals who have been exposed to HIV suggest that low levels of immune activation may contribute to protection against infection. In the present study, HIV-resistant individuals were shown to have reduced frequencies of T cells expressing the activation marker CD69. They were also found to have elevated frequencies of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells, compared with HIV-negative control individuals. By controlling levels of T cell activation, T(reg) cells may contribute to HIV resistance by minimizing the pool of cells susceptible to infection."
2046,0.005,1.0000,"CD8+ lymphocyte phenotypes were characterized during acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and a comparison was made to previous studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This was of interest because CD8+ cells contribute to immunologic control of both infections, but the usual outcome of EBV infection is benign, whereas untreated HIV infection is fatal. During acute EBV infection, CD8+ cells expressed elevated levels of the activation antigens CD38 and HLA-DR, similar to that during chronic HIV infection. Within 16 weeks, when EBV latency is established, CD8+ cell activation had resolved. In contrast, activation persists in HIV infection. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ cells could be a marker for ongoing viral replication in both infections. Other CD8+ cell alterations observed in this study of acute EBV infection included increases in both CD62L- and CD62L+ CD8+ cells and unique kinetics in the expansion of the CD57+CD8+ cell subset."
6510,0.005,1.0000,"Together with CD4(+)-cell counts as an indicator of immune function, the use of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels as a direct marker of viral load has gained widespread attention for evaluation of patient clinical status. Results obtained with other HIV-1 markers for this purpose are often inconsistent. This study examined the relationship between various HIV-1 markers by using clinical specimens (plasma) from HIV-1-infected individuals at different stages of disease progression and supernatant fluid from four human T-lymphocyte cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1. Cell culture specimens were collected periodically over 7 days and were tested for HIV-1 RNA levels with a nucleic acid amplification assay, for p24 with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and for reverse transcriptase activity by isotope uptake. An increase in the level of each marker was observed over the 7-day period with each of the four HIV-1 strains tested (LAV1, HTLV-IIIB, MN, and ARV2); with these specimens, the frequency of detection for each marker was 100%. In the clinical specimens, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (143 of 183 specimens [78%]) than was p24 (87 of 183 [48%]); little correlation between the levels of the two markers was seen. In these clinical specimens evaluated, CD4(+)-cell counts were better correlated with the frequency and levels of HIV-1 RNA than with p24. In specimens (n = 38) collected serially from six HIV-1-infected subjects, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (33 of 38 [85%]) than p24 (23 of 38 [59%]). When reported by the assays used, the levels of both HIV-1 markers fluctuated over time for each of the subjects. Although the markers correlated in the in vitro systems studied, the observed differences in the correlation of levels and frequencies of HIV-1 markers in vivo indicate that p24 has less clinical utility than does viral load testing when used in conjunction with CD4(+)-cell counts as a measure of immune system functioning."
5291,0.005,1.0000,"A comprehensive set of recombinant proteins and peptides of the proteome of HIV-1 clade C was prepared and purified and used to measure IgG, IgG-subclass, IgA and IgM responses in HIV-infected patients from Sub-Saharan Africa, where clade C is predominant. As a comparison group, HIV-infected patients from Europe were tested. African and European patients showed an almost identical antibody reactivity profile in terms of epitope specificity and involvement of IgG, IgG subclass, IgA and IgM responses. A V3-peptide of gp120 was identified as major epitope recognized by IgG1>IgG2 = IgG4>IgG3, IgA>IgM antibodies and a C-terminal peptide represented another major peptide epitope for the four IgG subclasses. By contrast, gp41-derived-peptides were mainly recognized by IgG1 but not by the other IgG subclasses, IgA or IgM. Among the non-surface proteins, protease, reverse transcriptase+RNAseH, integrase, as well as the capsid and matrix proteins were the most frequently and strongly recognized antigens which showed broad IgG subclass and IgA reactivity. Specificities and magnitudes of antibody responses in African patients were stable during disease and antiretroviral treatment, and persisted despite severe T cell loss. Using a comprehensive panel of gp120, gp41 peptides and recombinant non-surface proteins of HIV-1 clade C we found an almost identical antibody recognition profile in African and European patients regarding epitopes and involved IgG-sublass, IgA- and IgM-responses. Immune recognition of gp120 peptides and non-surface proteins involved all four IgG subclasses and was indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. The HIV-1 clade C proteome-based test allowed diagnosis and monitoring of antibody responses in the course of HIV-infections and assessment of isotype and subclass responses. "
9784,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) induces defects of both cellular and humoral immune responses. Impaired CD4+ T cell help and B cell dysfunction may partially explain the low frequency of broadly neutralizing antibodies in HIV-infected individuals. To understand the extent of B cell dysfunction during HIV infection, we assessed the level of B cell activation at baseline and after stimulation with a variety of antigens. Increased levels of viremia were associated with higher baseline expression of the activation marker CD86 on B cells and with decreased ability of B cells to increase expression of CD86 after in vitro stimulation with inactivated HIV-1. In a series of cell isolation experiments B cell responses to antigen were enhanced in the presence of autologous CD4+ T cells. HIV infected individuals had a higher frequency of PD-1 expression on B cells compared to HIV- subjects and PD-1 blockade improved B cell responsiveness to HIV antigen, suggesting that inhibitory molecule expression during HIV-1 infection may contribute to some of the observed B cell defects. Our findings demonstrate that during chronic HIV infection, B cells are activated and lose full capacity to respond to antigen, but suppression of inhibitory pressures as well as a robust CD4+ T cell response may help preserve B cell function.

91,0.005,1.0000,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) may be a key component of this process. In the present study, Tregs and conventional T cells (Tconvs) were isolated by magnetic cell sorting of peripheral blood from CHB patients (n=57), individuals with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (n=15), and healthy controls (n=29). SATB1 expression was studied by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, and the correlation of SATB1 expression to the expression of liver inflammation serum markers and the HBV DNA load was assessed. CHB patients showed significantly reduced SATB1 expression in Tregs than healthy controls and individuals with resolved HBV infections. Moreover, SATB1 expression in Tregs was significantly lower than in Tconvs of patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum HBV DNA and liver inflammation markers were inversely correlated to the SATB1 mRNA level in Tregs. Antiviral treatment was accompanied by increased expression of the SATB1 gene in Tregs. Thus, Tregs from CHB patients have reduced levels of SATB1, which is resolved with antiviral therapy. Inhibition of SATB1 expression may impair the hepatic inflammatory response and contribute to HBV persistence."
6231,0.005,1.0000,An increase of the mean corpuscular volume of the red blood cells has been repeatedly described in antiretroviral treated patients. Most commonly macrocytosis was associated with the use of certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to analyse if macrocytosis might be a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients. Using the (13)C-methionine breath test we analysed the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients with macrocytosis. MCV was significantly negatively correlated to the breath test results. For the first time we could show a significant association between an increase of the mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume by treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo.
4796,0.005,1.0000,"Among health professionals, knowledge about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is often limited, inaccurate, or both. Many health professionals also resist working with AIDS patients. This 1988 survey examined exaggerated risk estimates for HIV contagion in relationship to HIV-AIDS knowledge and resistance to working with AIDS patients among medical and nursing students at a large Northwestern teaching hospital. The results indicate that among the respondents, exaggerated risk estimates were associated both with a lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge and with greater resistance to working with AIDS patients. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that (1) a lack of clinical experience with AIDS patients and (2) antihomosexual attitudes were significantly associated with the students' lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge, even after controlling for the effects of exaggerated risk estimates. The first two variables also were shown to be significantly predictive of the students' resistance to working with AIDS patients, as was an intolerance of drug use and drug users, beyond the influence of exaggerated risk estimates. Specific approaches of developing effective HIV-AIDS educational programs for health professionals are proposed."

HBV vaccine coverage, and barrier prevention methods used. Among dentists, 7% (95% CI 4-11) and 0.5% (95% CI 0-3) had serological evidence of previous HBV and HCV infection, respectively. Similar figures for dental assistants were 1% (95% CI 0-5) and 0% (95% CI 0-4). Only 74% of dentists and 63% of dental assistants reported HBV vaccination. Approximately half always used gloves, eye glasses, or face masks. HBV unvaccinated dentists whose patients had HBV risk factors had a greater risk of HBV infection; those who always wore face masks were at lower risk (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02-0.98). These data indicate that among Berlin dentists, the HCV risk was lower than that of HBV and that face masks may have lowered the risk of HBV. The use of eye glasses or gloves did not appear to lower the risk of HBV acquisition in this population."

Participants completed questionnaires to elicit demographic, drug and sex risk information, and were tested for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV.A linear regression model predicting the total number of infections (0 to 4 possible) was constructed. Significant associations were found between HAV and HBV infection, HAV and HCV infection, and HBV and HCV infection. Predictors of total co-infections included age of first injection, lifetime years in jail, and Hispanic ethnicity. Latinos had the highest proportion of HAV and HBV co-infection with HCV.

Past studies have reported that these individuals frequently suffer from oral opportunistic infections and have a tendency to develop severe periodontal disease. This study extends past research by examining the prevalence of oral infections according to patient characteristics and by reporting, for the first time, the level of perceived dental need in a large, multi-site sample of individuals with symptomatic HIV disease. Data for this study come from a survey of 857 clients of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program in 9 U.S. cities. More respondents (52%) reported a need for dental care than for any other service need. Multivariate analysis showed that clients who were white, in low-income groups, used intravenous drugs, or had a past history of oral opportunistic infections were more likely to report dental need. Relations between age, gender, insurance status, or disease status and perceived need were statistically nonsignificant. Forty-seven percent of the clients reported they had an oral opportunistic infection, the second outcome variable examined in this study. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the prevalence of oral opportunistic infections among race and disease severity groups. Whites and the more severely ill were more likely to report an infection than their respective counterparts."

In this review, we will first outline these changes based on epidemiological studies and describe the impact of cART on lymphoma risk and mortality. Then, we will discuss some immunological factors that may contribute to the increased risk of lymphoma persisting after the administration of cART, including immunological non-response to therapy, chronic B-cell activation and dysfunction, T follicular helper cells, natural killer cells and altered lymphopoiesis. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of HIV-associated lymphoma under effective cART will inform future treatment strategies. "

Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
5651,0.005,1.0000,"It is admitted that viral infections can be responsible for systemic vasculitides. Viruses can be responsible for various types of vasculitis that affect vessels of different sizes. Clinical manifestations are the same as those observed in previously described vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa or cryoglobulinemia. When viral infection is diagnosed and considered to be responsible for vasculitis, a specific therapeutic approach must be prescribed. Treatment is based on the combination of antiviral agents and symptomatic or immunomodulating therapies. Antiviral therapy facilitates virus clearance and seroconversion to specific antibodies. In systemic vasculitides, plasma exchanges are a powerful treatment that clears circulating immune complexes. In the case of digital ischemia, vasodilators are also useful. Conversely, steroids and cytotoxic agents stimulate virus replication and favor disease chronicity and deleterious effects due to the presence of the virus. Hepatitis B virus-related polyarteritis nodosa can be cured with the combination of antiviral agents (mainly interferon alpha) and plasma exchanges. Hepatitis C virus-related cryoglobulinemia responds to interferon alpha and sometimes to plasma exchanges, but responses are usually partial and relapses occur in the majority of cases. In HIV-related vasculitides, currently available antiretroviral agents are not able to definitively eradicate the virus but their combination with plasma exchanges can cure the vasculitis. Due to common epidemiologic factors, several viruses can be present in the same patient, and determining their responsibility in the vasculitic process requires careful clinical and virologic analysis and then the selection of a specifically adapted therapeutic regimen. The therapeutic strategy applied in virus-associated vasculitides is therefore based on the etiologic investigations and the choice of a treatment is adapted to the pathogenetic mechanisms."
8760,0.005,1.0000,"The serodiagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection primarily relies on the detection of antibodies, most of which are directed against the immunodominant regions (IDR) of HIV-1 structural proteins. Among these, the N-terminal region of gp41 contains cluster I (amino acids [aa] 580 to 623), comprising the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope (AVERYLKDQQLL) and the cysteine loop (CSGKLIC), and cluster II (aa 646 to 682), comprising an ectodomain region (ELDKWA). To delineate the epitope diversity within clusters I and II and to determine whether the diversity affects serologic detection by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits, gp41 Env sequences from 247 seropositive persons infected with HIV-1 group M, subtypes A (n = 42), B (n = 62), B' (n = 13), C (n = 38), D (n = 41), E (n = 18), F (n = 27), and G (n = 6), and 6 HIV-1-infected but persistently seronegative (HIPS) persons were analyzed. While all IDR were highly conserved among both seropositive and HIPS persons, minor amino acid substitutions (<20% for any one residue, mostly conservative) were observed for all subtypes, except for B', in comparison with the consensus sequence for each subtype. Most importantly, none of the observed substitutions among the group M plasma specimens affected antibody detection, since all specimens (n = 152) tested positive with all five FDA-licensed EIA kits. Furthermore, all specimens reacted with a group M consensus gp41 peptide (WGIKQLQARVLAVERYLKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWNASW), and high degrees of cross-reactivity (>80%) were observed with an HIV-1 group N peptide, an HIV-1 group O peptide, and a peptide derived from the homologous region of gp41 from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzee (SIVcpz). Taken together, these data indicate that the minor substitutions observed within the IDR of gp41 of HIV-1 group M subtypes do not affect antibody recognition and that all HIV-1-seropositive specimens containing the observed substitutions react with the FDA-licensed EIA kits regardless of viral genotype and geographic origin."
4109,0.005,1.0000,"Liver disease is currently the second leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons in Western countries. Hepatitis C virus infection accounts for the majority of cases of hepatic illness in this population. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients, many challenges still remain unsolved. The combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of choice in hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected patients, regardless of hepatitis C virus genotype. However, the limited efficacy of this therapy in the HIV setting makes necessary the development of new strategies and/or drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Several anti-hepatitis C virus compounds are currently under investigation, although most are still in the early stages of clinical development. There is a relatively large group of patients who will be unable to be treated with the current hepatitis C virus medication based on interferon, mainly due to contraindications such as serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular history. However, for those without contraindications, treatment should be provided with no restrictions at the start (e.g. asking unnecessarily for a liver biopsy), and reassessed at weeks 4 and 12, considering virologic responses. Treatment should only be continued in early virologic responders. The use of standard doses of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and for at least 12 months seems crucial to maximize the effect of current hepatitis C treatment in the HIV setting, while no further benefit seems to derive from using higher than recommended pegylated interferon dosages. In patients with rapid virologic response (undetectable viremia at week 4) to anti-hepatitis C therapy, shorter periods of therapy (24 weeks) may be advisable in hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3. Finally, adequate selection of candidates and careful selection of concomitant antiretroviral medications must be encouraged. Patients with low CD4 percentages (< 15%) should be deferred for treatment and HAART prioritized in order to improve CD4 counts. When possible, nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and abacavir should be replaced by others having no deleterious interactions with ribavirin (e.g. tenofovir, lamivudine, or emtricitabine). Didanosine should never be coadministered with ribavirin due to potential life-threatening complications."

5388,0.005,1.0000,"Combination antiretroviral therapy for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) has extended life expectancy, and enabled PLHA to live productive lives that can include having children. Despite calls to address childbearing for PLHA there has been limited attention to developing safe conception programs. This research sought to assess the childbearing desires of PLHA and the experiences of health care providers serving this population. Research entailed a brief cross-sectional client survey given to HIV-infected men and women over age 18 at two Los Angeles County clinics administered over an 8-week period. Focus group discussions were conducted with providers at each clinic site. Although 39% of the 93 clients surveyed reported a desire to have children, two-thirds of clients had not discussed their desires, or methods of safe conception, with providers. Providers reported challenges in providing safe conception services in resource poor settings where clients cannot afford assisted fertility services and in the absence of national, state, or county guidelines for safe conception. They noted complex and varied client circumstances and a critical need for provider training in safe conception. Guidelines that focus on safe conception and harm reduction strategies as well as the legal ramifications of counseling on these practices are needed. HIV providers need training and patients need educational tools and workshops informing them of the risks, challenges, and options available to them and their partners to safely conceive and bear an HIV-negative child."
4498,0.005,1.0000,"Acute exercise is known to activate the immune system and thus could lead to increased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication. We sought to determine whether a single acute bout of exercise, similar to what people experience when starting an intensive exercise program, has a detrimental effect on plasma HIV RNA levels. Twenty-five patients with HIV infection performed one 15-min bout of acute exercise. Absolute neutrophil counts, serum creatine phosphokinase, and 72-h urinary 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscle protein breakdown) were measured before and after the exercise, along with plasma HIV RNA levels. There were increases in neutrophil counts (P < 0.06), serum creatine phosphokinase (P < 0. 01), and urinary 3-methylhistidine (P < 0.01) in response to exercise, indicating a mild acute-phase response with muscle proteolysis. However, mean HIV RNA, which was elevated at baseline in 22 of the 25 subjects (mean of 4 x 10(5) +/- 0.7 x 10(5) copies/ml), did not increase during the week after exercise (P = 0. 12). Small changes in RNA were seen in the three subjects with initially undetectable HIV RNA, but the significance of these changes is unclear. Acute exercise does not have a deleterious effect on HIV replication in adults with high viral loads. Because regular exercise training has not been shown to activate the acute-phase response, the lack of increased viral loads in response to an acute exercise intervention suggests that exercise training is safe in people with HIV infection."

All subjects were admitted to Chiang Mai University Hospital between December 1993 and October 1995. Cases were younger than controls (16-30 years vs. > 30 years of age; odds ratio [OR] = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.22-4.07). Patients with a recent history of occupational or other exposure to soil, especially during the rainy season (May to October), were more likely to present with P. marneffei infection (OR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.04-3.52). History of exposure to or consumption of bamboo rats, the only known nonhuman hosts of P. marneffei, was not a risk factor for infection. Our data suggest that recent exposure to a potential environmental reservoir of organisms in the soil may be associated with disseminated P. marneffei infections among patients with AIDS in Northern Thailand."

PN and IF antibodies accounted for a minor fraction of the NA activity of sera from all population groups. Sera from HIV-1-infected individuals (particularly AIDS patients) displayed higher levels of PN and IF antibodies than those from the healthy control group; however, the relative contribution of these antibodies to the global serum NA activity appeared to be lower in the former individuals than in immunocompetent controls. Serum antibodies preventing HCMV cell-to-cell spread (IP) were then measured to determine whether a specific deficiency could be detected in the HIV-1-infected group population. Serum IP antibody titres were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected individuals (particularly in AIDS patients) than in controls. The potential implications of the data for explaining the pathogenesis of HCMV infection are discussed."
4474,0.005,1.0000,"Short-term studies indicate that hepatitis B vaccines are safe and satisfactorily immunogenic in hemophiliacs. The duration of immunity in these immunocompromised patients, however, is not known. To determine this, we studied 78 hemophiliacs prospectively 2, 3, and 4 years after the initial vaccination with a plasma-derived vaccine given as three monthly injections followed by a fourth booster injection at month 14. The duration of immunity clearly depended on whether the patients were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In HIV seronegative hemophiliacs (n = 67), there was a progressive decline in titers of antibody to the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), but antibody was still detectable 4 years later in all of them. From the curves of decline of antibody titers, it appears that there is no need to revaccinate patients for at least 5 to 6 years. The HIV seropositive hemophiliacs (n = 11) not only started from much lower anti-HBs titers, but 5 of 11 lost anti-HBs. None of the 45 patients treated with concentrates during the postvaccination period developed serologic signs of hepatitis B, even though 6 of them had come into contact with live or inactivated hepatitis B virus as shown by the occurrence of spontaneous anamnestic antibody responses. This vaccine and schedule of vaccination afford a prolonged duration of immunity in HIV seronegative hemophiliacs, but HIV seropositive hemophiliacs have a risk of losing immunity early."
4137,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes persistent infection in the majority of infected individuals. The mechanisms of persistence and clearance are only partially understood. Antibodies (Abs) against host cell entry receptors have been shown to inhibit HCV infection in cell culture and animal models. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether anti-receptor Abs are induced during infection in humans in vivo and whether their presence is associated with outcome of infection. We established an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay using a recombinant CD81-claudin-1 (CLDN1) fusion protein to detect and quantify Abs directed against extracellular epitopes of the HCV CD81-CLDN1 coreceptor complex. The presence of anti-receptor Abs was studied in serum of patients from a well-defined cohort of a single-source HCV outbreak of pregnant women and several control groups, including uninfected pregnant women, patients with chronic hepatitis B and D virus (HBV/HDV) infection, and healthy individuals. Virus-neutralizing activity of Abs was determined using recombinant cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Our results demonstrate that HCV-infected patients have statistically significantly higher anti-CD81/CLDN1 Ab titers during the early phase of infection than controls. The titers were significantly higher in resolvers compared to persisters. Functional studies using immunoadsorption and HCV cell culture models demonstrate that HCV-neutralizing anti-receptor Abs are induced in the early phase of HCV infection, but not in control groups."
1583,0.005,1.0000,"Neuronal damage in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the brain is thought to occur at least in part through NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitation initiated by soluble neurotoxins from HIV-infected brain macrophages. Furthermore, brain regions enriched in NMDAR-2A (NR2A) and NMDAR-2B (NR2B) subunits, such as the hippocampus, are particularly vulnerable. Using cultured rat hippocampal cells and HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HIV/MDM), we examined the role of NR2A and NR2B in HIV/MDM-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We used the primary HIV-1 strain Jago derived from the CSF of an individual with HIV-associated dementia and that robustly replicates in MDM. We found the following: (1) hippocampal neuronal susceptibility to HIV/MDM excitotoxins varies according to the developmental expression patterns of NR2A and NR2B; (2) NMDAR activation by HIV/MDM results in neuronal calpain activation, which results in neuronal death; and (3) selective antagonists of homomeric NR2B/NR2B- and heteromeric NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDARs, as well as an inhibitor of calpain activity, afford neuroprotection against HIV/MDM. These studies establish a clear link between macrophage HIV infection, neuronal NR2A and NR2B activation, and calpain-mediated hippocampal neuronal death. They further suggest a dominant role for NR2A and NR2B in determining neuronal susceptibility in HIV-infected brain. Antagonists of NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as inhibitors of calpain activation offer attractive neuroprotective approaches against HIV in both developing and mature brain."

A cross sectional study was performed from October 2009 to October 2011 among 143 MSM by face-to-face interviews to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects were tested for ,HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2 and toxoplasma infection using serology and for TTV using molecular detection. The seropositive rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HTLV-1/2, IgM anti-T. gondii, IgG anti-T, gondii and TTV DNA were 9.1%, 9.8%, 28.0%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 30.8%, and 26.6%, respectively. Risk factors associated with HIV infection were a history of injecting drug use (IDU) [adjusted OR (aOR) 6.0; 95% CI: 1.10-33.01] and a receptive role in sexual activity (aOR 8.1; 95% CI: 1.30-50.04) [corrected]. Having a tattoo (aOR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-7.98) and practicing both anal and vaginal sex without a condom (aOR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92) were associated with toxoplasma infection. A history of IDU (aOR 32; 95% CI: 5.93-177.93) was associated with TTV infection. The subjects examined in this study were found to be infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2, TTV, and T. gondii.

Given the high sequence identity and similarity between the envelope gp120 glycoproteins of HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the inhibitory activity of a variety of CBAs were evaluated against HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. There seemed to be a close correlation for the inhibitory potential of CBAs against HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV replication in cell culture and syncytia formation in cocultures of persistently SIV-infected HUT-78 cell cultures and uninfected CEM cells. CBAs also inhibit transmission of the SIV to T lymphocytes after capture of the virus by dendritic cell-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN)-expressing cells. A total of 8 different SIV strains were isolated after prolonged HHA, UDA, and PRM-A exposure in virus-infected cell cultures. Each virus isolate consistently contained at least 2 or 3 glycan deletions in its gp120 envelope and showed decreased sensitivity to the CBAs and cross-resistance toward all CBAs. Our data revealed that CBAs afford SIV and HIV-1 inhibition in a similar manner regarding prevention of virus infection, DC-SIGN-directed virus capture-related transmission, and selection of drug-resistant mutant virus strains. Therefore, SIV(mac251)-infected monkeys might represent a relevant animal model to study the efficacy of CBAs in vivo."

Sixty stored placentas were examined for PM and other placental pathology, comparing 20 HIV-infected mother-infant (perinatal transmitter) pairs, 20 HIV-uninfected pairs, and 20 HIV-infected mothers who did not transmit to their infant perinatally. Of 60 placentas examined, 45% showed evidence of PM. Placental malaria was associated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-29.1), especially among primigravidae (aOR = 12.0; 95% CI = 1.0-150; P < 0.05). Before antiretroviral therapy or prophylaxis, PM was associated with early infant HIV infection among rural Rwandan women living in a hyper-endemic malaria region.

However, the presence of specific neurotropic HIV-1 strains, the extent of viral replication in the brain, and the type of cells infected remain controversial issues. To address this controversy we have analyzed different V3 loop sequences of viral isolates from four vertically HIV-1-infected children who developed HIV-1-related encephalopathy. Moreover, we have determined that some biological and molecular properties of HIV-1 might contribute to AIDS neurological dysfunctions. We detected very different HIV-1 isolates (X4 and R5) in the brain despite no great differences in clinical, pathological, or immunological parameters. In vitro, no differences in replicative competence in glial or neuroblastoma cells were observed between virus isolated from the blood of children with or without clinical neurological symptoms. The expression of both CXCR4 and CCR5 RNAs was observed in the brain independently of HIV-1 infection and viral strain predominant in this location. Our results failed to show a particular phenotypic property of the HIV-1 virus that might explain its neurovirulence and/or neurotropism."

This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
8678,0.005,1.0000,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population.

The most frequent etiologies include primary diseases (caused by HIV itself) or secondary diseases (opportunistic infections or neoplasms). Despite these conditions, HIV-infected patients are susceptible to other infections observed in patients without HIV infection. Here we report a rare case of a brain abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus in an HIV-infected patient. After drainage of the abscess and treatment with oxacilin, the patient had a favorable outcome. This case reinforces the importance of a timely neurosurgical procedure that supported adequate management of an unusual cause of expansive brain lesions in HIV-1 infected patients. "
6029,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a great public health problem, with an estimated 200 million chronically infected patients worldwide. No vaccines are currently available for HCV, and only a subset of HCV patients responds to interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and Ribavirin treatment. Substantial evidence has emerged recently to support the role of the host immune response in the outcome and pathogenesis of HCV infection. Our aims of this article are to present the immune-based novel therapeutic options for HCV infection and the evidence supporting their use in patients with chronic hepatitis C. There is a growing consensus that acute control of HCV infection is associated with a vigorous intrahepatic antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response. IFN-gamma was detectable in the livers of the chimpanzees that cleared or controlled the virus, raising the possibility that IFN-gamma might perform antiviral effector functions during HCV infection. Based on these observations, therapeutic induction of intrahepatic IFN-gamma by adoptive immunotherapy might be able to control chronic HCV infection. Immune-based novel therapies appear to hold great promise in treating chronic HCV infection."

HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."
8008,0.005,1.0000,"We introduced various mutations into the activation and RNA binding domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat in order to develop a novel and potent transdominant Tat protein and to characterize its mechanism of action. The different mutant Tat proteins were characterized for their abilities to activate the HIV LTR and inhibit the function of wild-type Tat in trans. A Tat protein containing a deletion of the basic domain (Tat(delta)49-57) localized exclusively to the cytoplasm of transfected human cells was nonfunctional and inhibited both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat function in a transdominant manner. Tat proteins containing mutations in the cysteine-rich and core domains were nonfunctional but failed to inhibit Tat function in trans. When Tat nuclear or nucleolar localization signals were fused to the carboxy terminus of Tat(delta)49-57, the chimeric proteins localized to the nucleus or nucleolus, respectively, and remained capable of acting in a transdominant manner. Introduction of secondary mutations in the cysteine-rich and core domains of the various transdominant Tat proteins completely eliminated their abilities to act in a transdominant fashion. Our data best support a mechanism in which these transdominant Tat proteins squelch a cellular factor or factors that interact with the Tat activation domain and are required for Tat to function."

We investigated its prevalence and relationship to clinical stage of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection using quantitative sensory testing and nerve conduction testing. Vibratory threshold was determined in the right great toe and index finger of 179 men seropositive for HIV (28 with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or AIDS-related complex [ARC], 151 asymptomatic) and 32 HIV-seronegative controls. None had clinical peripheral neuropathy. Abnormal threshold was control mean plus 2.5 SDs. In the toe, 10 (36%) of 28 subjects with AIDS or ARC had abnormal vibratory thresholds, compared with seven (5%) of 151 asymptomatic seropositive subjects and none of 32 controls. A subgroup of 168 seropositive subjects underwent nerve conduction testing. Abnormality rates were similar, but abnormalities of nerve conduction coincided with quantitative sensory testing abnormalities in only half the cases. Mean (+/-SD) vibratory threshold was significantly greater in subjects with AIDS or ARC (3.00 +/- 0.51 vibratory units) than in asymptomatic subjects (1.56 +/- 0.27 vibratory units) and controls (1.63 +/- 0.54 vibratory units). Finger abnormality rates did not differ, although subjects with AIDS or ARC had greater mean vibratory threshold. Subclinical peripheral neuropathy is thus related to stage of HIV infection and is present by quantitative sensory testing in 36% of patients with AIDS or ARC."
3832,0.005,1.0000,"The Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is essential for the expression of the structural genes of HIV-1. To determine whether a functional threshold level of Rev is required to allow efficient HIV-1 replication, CD4-positive HeLa cells, constitutively expressing a Rev-deficient provirus, were transfected with various quantities of a Rev-expressing plasmid. Compared with the quantity of the Rev-producing plasmid transfected, HIV-1 replication was distinctly nonlinear as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen and HIV-1-specific RNA production. A quantitative RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that Rev mRNA expression was linearly correlated with the quantity of Rev-expressing plasmid which was transfected into these cells.

Using a counting-process formulation of the Cox model, we analyzed observation time in these 2 groups for persons who were prescribed antiretroviral therapy but not prophylaxis. The incidences of the infections were low for patients whose CD4(+) count rose above the threshold of risk (PCP, 0.6 cases per 100 person-years [PY]; MAC, 1. 0 cases per 100 PY) and not higher than in persons whose CD4(+) counts had not decreased below these thresholds, which suggests that discontinuation of primary prophylaxis for opportunistic infections may be considered for some patients."

However, the temporal stability of HBV DNA in anti-HBe carriers remains poorly characterised. UK Department of Health guidelines use HBV DNA levels to define whether HBV-infected health care workers may perform exposure-prone procedures. Two samples separated by 1-23 years available from 147 carriers were analysed for precore variants and HBV DNA levels. Among 15 HBeAg carriers, HBV DNA was maintained at high levels. There was a 5 log(10) fold reduction in DNA in 11 individuals who developed anti-HBe during follow-up evaluation. Proportional changes in HBV DNA levels in anti-HBe carriers were similar to those in HBeAg carriers, although there was a trend for changes in viral DNA to be more marked in anti-HBe carriers followed up for longer periods. Closer sampling in 20 anti-HBe carriers demonstrated large fluctuations of DNA levels over short periods. Serum transaminases and precore mutant status at the outset failed to predict those in whom HBV DNA levels fluctuated. HBV DNA was below the detection threshold (<400 copies/ml) in 36 anti-HBe carriers at first sampling and remained so in all but 5 of these carriers. Twelve individuals who were previously viraemic lost detectable HBV DNA during follow-up evaluation. While HBV DNA levels are found to fluctuate in carriers, our results indicate that once below the threshold of detectability, levels are unlikely to rise. This is an important factor when assessing health care workers for exposure-prone procedures."
6789,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patient isolates and molecular clones were used to analyze the determinants responsible for human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice. Non-syncytium-inducing, R5 or R3R5 HIV-1 isolates from asymptomatic infected people showed little or no human CD4(+) thymocyte depletion in SCID-hu mice, while syncytium-inducing (SI), R5X4 or R3R5X4 HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals, isolated just prior to the onset of AIDS, rapidly and efficiently eliminated CD4-bearing human thymocytes. We have mapped the ability of one SI HIV-1 isolate to eliminate CD4(+) human cells in SCID-hu mice to a region of the env gene including the three most amino-terminal variable regions (V1 to V3). We find that for all of the HIV-1 isolates that we studied, a nonlinear relationship exists between viral replication and the depletion of CD4(+) cells. This relationship can best be described mathematically with a Hill-type plot indicating that a threshold level of viral replication, at which cytopathic effects begin to be seen, exists for HIV-1 infection of thymus/liver grafts in SCID-hu mice. This threshold level is 1 copy of viral DNA for every 11 cells (95% confidence interval = 1 copy of HIV-1 per 67 cells to 1 copy per 4 cells). Furthermore, while SI viruses more frequently achieve this level of replication, replication above this threshold level correlates best with cytopathic effects in this model system. We used GHOST cells to map the coreceptor specificity and relative entry efficiency of these early- and late-stage patient isolates of HIV-1. Our studies show that coreceptor specificity and entry efficiency are critical determinants of HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo."

Using a comprehensive panel of serological assays, we have previously demonstrated a complex and lengthy maturation of virus-specific antibody responses elicited by attenuated strains of SIV that was closely associated with the development of protective immunity. In the present study, we expand these analyses to address several questions regarding the nature of the virus-specific antibody responses to pathogenic SIV, SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV), and HIV-1 infections. The results demonstrate for the first time a common theme of antibody maturation to SIV, SHIV, and HIV-1 infections that is characterized by ongoing changes in antibody titer, conformational dependence, and antibody avidity during the first 6 to 10 months following virus infection. We demonstrate that this gradual evolution of virus-specific antibody responses is independent of the levels of virus replication and the pathogenicity of the infection viral strain. While the serological assays used in these studies were useful in discriminating between protective and nonprotective antibody responses during evaluation of vaccine efficacy with attenuated SIV, these same assays do not distinguish the clinical outcome of infection in pathogenic SIV, SHIV, or HIV-1 infections. These results likely reflect differences in the immune mechanisms involved in mediating protection from virus challenge compared to those that control an established viral infection, and they suggest that additional characteristics of both humoral and cellular responses evolve during this early immune maturation."

Risk levels were correlated with demographic factors, diagnosis, symptom severity, trauma history, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorder (SUD), and sexual orientation. SMI clients from urban and rural settings (N = 275) were assessed regarding HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and hypothesized risk factors. Patients exhibited substantial levels of risky behavior, particularly sexual risk. Correlates of increased risk included SUD, trauma, male homosexual orientation, younger age, and symptom severity. Structural equation modeling identified SUD and sexual orientation as the primary determinants of both drug and sexual risk behavior. We conclude that specific illness related variables appear to have less impact on risk behavior among people with SMI than previously hypothesized. Substance abuse prevention and treatment may be the most effective means of reducing HIV risk in this population."

The essential trace element selenium has an important function in maintaining immune processes and may, thus, have a critical role in clearance of mycobacteria. The impact of selenium status on the development of mycobacterial diseases in HIV-1-seropositive drug users was investigated over a 2-year period (1999-2001). Twelve cases of mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis, 9; infection due to atypical Mycobacterium species, 3) occurred; these 12 cases were compared with 32 controls with no history of respiratory infections who were matched on age, sex, and HIV status. Significant risk for development of mycobacterial disease was associated with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm 3, malnutrition, and selenium levels of <or=135 microg/L (patients with these levels were 13 times more likely to develop mycobacterial disease). Multivariate analyses controlling for antiretroviral treatment and CD4 cell count revealed that both body mass index and selenium level remained significant factors in the relative risk for developing mycobacterial disease (relative risk, 3; p =.015); these findings suggest that selenium status may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease."

Interviews were conducted at enrollment and at 6 months in clinical care. Men and women reported similar scores in physical well-being, satisfaction with health care, and relationship with partner from the period prior to care, at enrollment, and at 6 months. Women scored significantly lower than men in psychosocial well-being from the period prior to care, at enrollment, and at 6 months (p < 0.05); women reported significantly higher levels of partner satisfaction at 6 months (p < 0.05).

Index cases (n=26) were IDUs who seroconverted to HBV and/or HCV during a prospective cohort study in Seattle. Interviewers elicited index cases' recent injection partners and administered recall cues and other techniques to boost recall. Index cases received vouchers for free hepatitis testing, which they were to give to locatable partners. Persons redeeming vouchers also received small monetary incentives. Most (26/40) seroconverters participated in the paid contact interviews. Index cases reported many partners (mean=17), and in the aggregate, index cases indicated they could refer more than one third of their elicited partners for testing. Overall, only 17 persons were ultimately referred and just eight of these were confirmed as partners sought for referral. The supplementary elicitation techniques, and especially the recall cues, increased reporting of injection partners substantially. The injection network constructed from reported partnerships was mostly connected and cyclic. Successful contact tracing in IDUs likely requires active involvement by public health staff to locate and notify exposed injection partners."

The treatment of HIV-1 and HCV patients, previously untreated with any IFN preparations, did not result in development of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha n3. Among 69 HCV refractory patients who were unresponsive to previous treatment with rIFN-alpha 2b, 2 had neutralizing antibodies to rIFN-alpha 2b prior to IFN-alpha n3 therapy, with no or limited cross-reactivity to IFN-alpha n3. After retreatment with IFN-alpha n3, both patients had detectable neutralizing titers to IFN-alpha n3. Additionally, 2 other patients developed low and transient neutralizing titers to IFN-alpha n3. Interferon subtype specificity of these antibodies was tested against RP-HPLC purified fractions of IFN-alpha n3, as well as rIFN-alpha 2b and rIFN-alpha 8b. Sera from patients previously treated with rIFN-alpha 2b with high antibody titers to rIFN-alpha 2b strongly reacted with the natural IFN-alpha 2b, and to a limited extent with other iFN-alpha subtypes. Neutralizing activity against IFN-alpha 2b was significantly competed out by the presence of a small amount of other interferon subtypes present in IFN-alpha n3. One patient with prior presence of antibodies to IFN-alpha 2b developed a high antibody titer to IFN-alpha 8b with limited reactivity to IFN-alpha n3. Two of the HCV refractory patients with prior neutralizing antibodies to rIFN-alpha 2b responded to IFN-alpha n3 therapy. These data suggest that the presence of neutralizing antibodies to individual IFN-alpha species will not significantly diminish the biological activity and the clinical efficacy of multi-species IFN-alpha n3."

2999,0.005,1.0000,"The therapeutic armamentarium for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection continues to expand. New targets such as entry and integration have recently been successfully exploited. However, HIV-infected patients in need of treatment are currently committed to lifelong suppressive therapy. The persistence of integrated HIV DNA genomes capable of producing virus is a fundamental obstacle to the eradication or cure of HIV infection. Rational molecular or pharmacologic strategies to eliminate persistent HIV proviral genomes are an unaddressed therapeutic need. Coupled with potent antiretroviral therapy, treatments that could efficiently deplete the persistent DNA reservoir of HIV could radically alter treatment paradigms. Prior attempts to target persistent proviral infection deployed intensive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in combination with global inducers of T-cell activation. Initial trials of this approach were unsuccessful. Non-specific T-cell activation may induce high-level viral replication above a level that can be fully contained by ART, while increasing the susceptibility of uninfected cells. Selective targeting of HIV provirus via agents that induce the expression of quiescent HIV, but have limited effects on the uninfected host cell is an alternate approach to attack latent HIV. Recent studies define the role of repressive chromatin structure in maintaining HIV quiescence, and suggest that mechanisms that remodel chromatin about the HIV promoter are a possible therapeutic target. Other studies have uncovered specific factors that may act to induce or maintain latency by limiting the efficiency of HIV gene expression. Attempts to deplete latent HIV using drugs that alter chromatin structure have entered clinical study."

Binding exhibited a nonlinear dependence on integrase concentration, suggesting that the enzyme functions as a multimer. The oligomeric state was investigated by UV-photo-cross-linking of integrase-LTR oligonucleotide complexes using DNA substrates substituted with 5-bromo-2'-deoxycytidine within the integrase recognition sequence. In the absence of divalent cation, integrase cross-linked to the LTR oligonucleotide as a single species whose mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was consistent with the formation of tetramers. Using these techniques, analysis of the binding properties of integrase mutants demonstrated that the catalytic and sequence-specific DNA binding activities of the enzyme are distinct, involving residues within the conserved ""DD(35)E"" and zinc finger motifs, respectively."

Substantially more hours of unpaid than paid care were used. We also found evidence of a strong association between type of service used and type of care provider: 62.4% of persons who used nursing services only received paid care only; conversely, 55.5% of persons who used personal care services only received care only from unpaid caregivers. Use of home care overall was concentrated among persons with AIDS: 39.5% of persons with AIDS received any home health care, compared to 9.5% of those at earlier disease stages. In addition to having an AIDS diagnosis, logistic regression analyses indicated that other need variables significantly increased utilization; a higher number of HIV-related symptoms, lower physical functioning, less energy, a diagnosis of CMV and a recent hospitalization each independently increased the odds of overall home care utilization. Sociodemographic variables had generally weak relationships with overall home care utilization. Among users of home care, non-need variables had more influence on use of paid than unpaid care. Both paid and unpaid home health care is a key component of community-based systems of care for people with HIV infection.

2168,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef protein has several independent functions that might contribute to efficient viral replication in vivo. Since HIV-1 adapts rapidly to its host environment, we investigated if different Nef properties are associated with disease progression. Functional analysis revealed that nef alleles obtained during late stages of infection did not efficiently downmodulate class I major histocompatibility complex but were highly active in the stimulation of viral replication. In comparison, functional activity in downregulation of CD4 and enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity were maintained or enhanced after AIDS progression. Our results demonstrate that various Nef activities are modulated during the course of HIV-1 infection to maintain high viral loads at different stages of disease progression. These findings suggest that all in vitro Nef functions investigated contribute to AIDS pathogenesis and indicate that nef variants with increased pathogenicity emerge in a significant number of HIV-1-infected individuals."

Here we present a broadly accessible microscopy method that captures multiple focal planes simultaneously, which allows us to image the trafficking of HIV-1 genomic RNAs with high precision. This method utilizes a customization of a commercial multichannel emission splitter that enables high-resolution 3D imaging with single-macromolecule sensitivity. We show with high temporal and spatial resolution that HIV-1 genomic RNAs are most mobile in the cytosol, and undergo confined mobility at sites along the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus and nucleolus. These provide important insights regarding the mechanism by which the HIV-1 RNA genome is transported to the sites of assembly of nascent virions. "

This assay compared most favorably with the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 assay (R(2) = 0.904), with a low standard deviation of difference being detected (0.323 copies/ml). The bias against comparator assays ranged from -0.001 copies/ml to -0.228 copies/ml. Variability in the reporting of VLs for a 20-member subtype panel compared to the variability of other assays was noted with subtypes G and CRF02-AG. The RealTime HIV-1 assay can test 93 samples per day with minimal manual preparation, less staff, and the minimization of contamination through automation. This assay is suitable for HIV-1 subtype C VL quantification in South Africa."
7511,0.005,1.0000,"Alterations of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, optokinetic nystagmus, and visuo-vestibular-ocular reflex, have already been described in patients with AIDS and HIV-1 positive asymptomatic subjects. The introduction to the clinical practice of posturographic techniques allows us to study, with precision, postural perturbation that may be present when performing Romberg's test and to study the vestibulo-spinal reflex as a component of the vestibular system. The relative lack of studies on posturography and AIDS, encouraged us to continue our research on the vestibular system both in asymptomatic HIV-1 seropositive patients and in patients with AIDS (IV stage according to the classification proposed by the Centre for Disease Control). Recordings were made in group 1 (control group, 55 normal subjects), in group 2 (15 asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects), and in group 3 (15 patients with AIDS stage IV). Static and dynamic posturography were carried out using Tonnies platform system (Tonnies GmbH & Co., Wurzburg, Germany) and the data were analysed with Tonnies Posturographic Tübingen (TPOST) software vers. 5.19. In asymptomatic HIV+ subjects, we observed an increase in RW, RA and M3 reflex latency. AIDS patients (stage IV) exhibited significant alterations in almost all the posturographic parameters and the electromyographic potentials. Our results validate static and dynamic posturography as a method for otoneurological investigation and appear to confirm that the entire vestibular system is involved since the earliest stages of the HIV infection. In the HIV+ subjects, a variable dysfunction in the reflex control to long latency was observed, which is correlated with the alteration of the central dopaminergic system; in AIDS patients, the central nervous system damage appears more important, globally distributed and correlated also with immunosuppression."
9562,0.005,1.0000,"Gene inactivation through DNA hypermethylation plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. This study aimed to profile aberrant DNA methylation in different stages of liver disease, namely noncirrhosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and also to clarify the influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection on the aberrant DNA methylation in HCCs. Promoter methylation in p14(ARF), p16(INK4a), O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) and E-cadherin (E-Cad) genes of 58 HCCs paired with adjacent nontumorous tissues was assayed by methylation-specific PCR. HBV infection was determined using a hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) serological assay. The frequency of p16(INK4a) promoter methylation increased from noncirrhotic, cirrhotic, to HCC tissues (noncirrhotic vs. HCC, p < 0.001), while that of GSTP1 promoter methylation increased in cirrhotic tissues compared to noncirrhotic ones (p = 0.029). The frequency of GSTP1 promoter hypermethylation is significantly higher in HCC than in nontumorous tissues (p = 0.022) from HBsAg-positive patients, but not the HBsAg-negative controls (p = 0.289). While the frequency of E-Cad promoter hypermethylation remained high in both nontumorous tissues and HCCs from HBsAg-positive patients (p = 0.438), it was lower in HCCs than in nontumorous tissues from HBsAg-negative patients (p = 0.002). In contrast, the frequency of p16(INK4a), MGMT and p14(ARF) promoter hypermethylation in HCCs was unrelated to HBsAg status. In conclusion, aberrant DNA methylation may begin at different stages of liver disease in a gene-dependent manner. Moreover, HBV infection may enhance or maintain GSTP1 and E-Cad promoter methylation and thereby affect hepatocarcinogenesis."
684,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent despite improved antiretroviral therapies. A HAND-specific biomarker indicative of neuropsychological impairment (NPI) would give insight into disease progression and aid clinicians in designing therapy. Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins such as tumor susceptibility gene (TSG)-101, vacuolar protein sorting (VPS)-4 and LIP-5 are important for HIV replication and recently antiviral interferon stimulated gene (ISG)-15 was proposed as a biomarker for CNS injury. Here, we analyzed a well-characterized cohort of HIV+ cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and postmortem brain specimens for multiple vesicular trafficking proteins and a related innate immune protein, ISG-15, TSG-101, VPS-4 and LIP-5. All protein levels trended higher with increased NPI and neuropathology. ISG-15 CSF levels were increased in HIV encephalitis (HIVE) compared to normal cases, and three quarters of HIVE samples had above average CSF ISG-15 levels. VPS-4 CSF levels were increased in NPI/NPI-O compared to normal patients. VPS-4 CSF levels in HIV-associated dementia were equivalent to that of normal patients. LIP-5 CSF levels positively correlate with ISG-15 levels, and higher than average ISG-15 levels indicate elevated viral load. Immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses show increased expression of ISG-15, VPS-4 and LIP-5 in neuronal cell bodies and astroglial cells. ESCRT protein CSF levels analyzed in conjunction with viral load may be indicative of NPI stage, and may aid in the diagnosis and design of therapies for HIV patients. Further studies on the ESCRT protein expression during HIV infection may lead to a promising biomarker for predicting progression of NPI. "
7326,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) develop a renal syndrome characterized by proteinuria, renal failure, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. By using a noninfectious HIV-1 DNA construct lacking the gag and pol genes, three transgenic mouse lines have been generated that develop a syndrome remarkably similar to the human disease. In the present study, we have characterized in detail one of these lines, Tg26. In Tg26 mice, proteinuria was detectable at approximately 24 days of age, followed by severe nephrotic syndrome and rapid progression to end-stage renal failure. Renal histology showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and microcystic tubular dilatation. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrated increased accumulation of the basement membrane components laminin, collagen type IV, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. The viral protein Rev was present in sclerotic glomeruli. Northern blot analysis of total renal RNA showed expression of viral genes prior to the appearance of histologic renal disease, with greatly diminished viral gene expression late in the disease course. Kidneys from transgenic mice expressed increased steady-state levels of collagen alpha 1(IV) mRNA when glomerulosclerosis was present. We conclude that the presence of HIV-1 genes is associated with progressive renal dysfunction and glomerulosclerosis in transgenic mice."
3448,0.005,1.0000,"To unravel the profile of intestinal microecological parameters in Chinese patients with asymptomatic carriage of hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic hepatitis B, decompensated HBV cirrhosis, and health controls and to establish their correlation with liver disease progression, we performed quantitative PCR and immunological techniques to investigate fecal parameters, including population of fecal predominant bacteria and the abundance of some virulence genes derived from Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium perfringens in fecal crude DNA and some immunological parameters in extracts of all fecal samples. Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 ± 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 ± 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 ± 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 ± 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-α in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance."

Between April 2006 and September 2009, 57 of 4,802 persons (1.2%) seeking VCT services were seropositive for E. histolytica infection. Compared with 228 seronegative controls, case subjects were older (odds ratio [OR] for per 1-year increase, 1.098; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.036, 1.165), less likely to hold bachelor degree or higher (OR, 0.359; 95% CI, 0.152, 0.846), and were more likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM) (OR, 8.382; 95% CI, 2.050, 34.266) and have oral-anal sex (OR, 4.016; 95% CI, 1.711, 9.427) in multiple logistic regression analysis. The MSM, fecal-oral contamination, lower educational achievement, and older age were associated with increased risk for amebiasis among persons seeking VCT for HIV infection."
76,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between ancillary services, including case management, and clinical and behavioral outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women. Data were obtained from databases systematically maintained by Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) and the HIV Outpatient Program (HOP) in New Orleans. HIV-infected women receiving primary care from HOP and ancillary services from FACES between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 were eligible. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with STATA software. The majority of women included in the study were African American (86.7%), infected heterosexually (78.8%), and had absolute CD4 counts greater than 200 (58.6%). After adjusting for age, time, entry time into HOP, pregnancy, CD4 count, substance abuse status, and social and clinical stressors, receipt of more than four combined case manager contacts or ancillary services per month was significantly associated with being prescribed a protease inhibitor, improved adherence and retention in primary care, and enrolling on a research protocol. Receiving more than one transportation service per month was significantly associated with improved adherence, improved retention, one or more emergency room visits per month, and one or more hospitalizations per month. Receiving more than one contact with case managers per month was associated with improved retention in primary care. Findings suggest that receipt of case management and ancillary services is associated with improvements in multiple outcomes for HIV-infected women. A client-centered approach to providing ancillary services appears to be effective in improving behavioral and utilization characteristics in this population of low-income, high-risk women."
2010,0.005,1.0000,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."
5228,0.005,1.0000,"Jamaica has the second highest number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and deaths in the Caribbean and a significant number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals have a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI). The study determined the prevalence of non-ulcerative and ulcerative STIs and their association with sexual risky behaviour in a sample of HIV seropositive men and women. This study was conducted at the Comprehensive Health Centre in Jamaica, a sexually transmitted infection referral centre. The sample comprised 138 men and 132 women age 15-49 years, of average 29.5 years. The study was retrospective, from 2000 to 2002, and sample collection was randomized. The sexual behaviours of the subjects were assessed from the case records. In the 270 HIV diagnosed cases examined, the prevalence of STIs was 51.1% in men and 48.9% in women, with 85.4% having one or more STIs with an average of four STIs per patient. There was a total occurrence of 744 STIs with non-gonococcal urethritis (19.4%), gonorrhoea (17.2%), candidiasis (13.4%), trichomonas (12.4%), genital ulcer (10.4%) and syphilis (7.3%) the most common in HIV infected men and women. The presence of STI was associated with continued practice of risky sexual behaviour. The age group most implicated was the 30-34 year old, and 73.1% of the HIV infected patients had multiple sexual partners with only 16.4% reporting frequent condom use. The study demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of non-ulcerative and to a lesser extent ulcerative STIs in HIV infected patients in Jamaica. There are significant associations between STIs and continued high risk sexual practices in HIV infected men and women. The findings support the need for implementation of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies coupled with education about safe-sex practices in HIV prevention and STI control programmes."
7596,0.005,1.0000,"National estimates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and adherence support services utilization are needed to inform efforts to improve the health of HIV-infected persons in the United States. In a nationally representative sample of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, 86% self-reported taking all ART doses in the past 72 hours. Overall, 20% reported using adherence support services and 2% reported an unmet need for services. If all nonadherent persons not receiving adherence support and all persons with a self-perceived unmet need for adherence support accessed services, resources to support ∼42,673 additional persons would be needed. Factors associated with lower adherence included younger age, female gender, depression, stimulant use, binge alcohol use, greater than once-daily dosing, longer time since HIV diagnosis, and patient beliefs. Predictors of adherence are multifactorial so multiple targeted strategies to improve adherence are warranted. Providing adherence support services to all those in need may require additional resources. "
7309,0.005,1.0000,"The simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model system has been used extensively to study AIDS pathogenesis and to test candidate vaccines for their ability to protect against homologous or heterologous challenge with pathogenic SIV or SHIV. Recent studies suggest that stimulation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses is important for effective vaccination against HIV-1. While quantitative measurements of SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses have been facilitated by the use of tetrameric peptide complexes, this technique is currently limited to the study of Mamu-A*01-positive rhesus macaques. Furthermore, very few SIV-specific CTL epitopes have been identified, and there is limited identification of other MHC alleles in macaques. In this study, cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) was used to quantify SIV-specific CD8+ antigen-reactive T cells in macaques infected with SIV. We found a strong correlation (r = 0.96, P < 0.001) between CD8+ antigen-reactive T cells stained with the Mamu-A*01 p11C, C-M tetramer and production of intracellular TNF-alpha in the CFC assay. Furthermore, the CFC assay was used to identify a novel SIV-specific CTL epitope in Envelope (SIV Env, a.a. 486-494, sequence AEVAELYRL). The use of the CFC assay facilitates the study of antigen-reactive T cell responses in SIV infection and vaccination."
9755,0.005,1.0000,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."
8841,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) serological markers have been investigated in 101 Lebanese patients (69 men, 32 women; mean age 32.7 +/- 1.7 years) infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Seven patients (6.9%) were HBsAg carriers compared with 54 patients (53.5%) who had no evidence of exposure to HBV infection. Twenty-four patients (23.8%) had anti-HBc alone as a serological marker compared with four patients who were positive for anti-HBs alone and 12 patients (11.9%) who were anti-HBc and anti-HBs-positive. Occult HBV infection (presence of HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg) is found to be relatively high (28.7%) in HIV-infected Lebanese patients and the overwhelming majority (83.3%) of those who were positive for anti-HBc alone had a detectable HBV DNA in their serum. However, none of our HIV-positive patients with occult HBV infection had abnormal alanine aminotransferase level, which also raises the question as to whether occult HBV plays a role in the aetiology of liver disease in HIV-infected patients. Further, studies on the association between HBV DNA levels and markers of liver function in addition to data on liver biopsy would help in answering this question."
1280,0.005,1.0000,"Since some haemophiliacs manifest profound immunodeficiency with no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection, we measured the circulating immune complex (CIC) level in sera obtained from haemophiliacs and addressed the question of whether viral infection is associated directly or indirectly with enhanced CIC production. While more than 90% of HIV-positive individuals had a high level of CIC, around 60% of seronegative ones also showed CIC levels comparable to those of seropositive patients. These sera activated fresh complement in vitro. The patients infected with either HIV or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or both showed higher frequency and concentration of serum CIC than those free of either pathogens. It is worth noting, however, that 64% of patients with no evidence of infection with HIV or HCV produced significant amounts of CIC. Among the infectious viruses examined, parvovirus is considered as one of the pathogens associated with CIC synthesis, since all the haemophiliacs including the HIV-free patients who had been supplied with heated coagulation factors for several years from birth carried antibodies to parvovirus B19. Strikingly, 60% of the children in this category were positive for CIC, suggesting the possible contribution of parvovirus infection to CIC formation."
2764,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) persistence is facilitated by exhaustion of CD8+ T cells that express the inhibitory receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). Blockade of PD-1 signaling improves in vitro proliferation of HCV-specific T lymphocytes, but whether antiviral function can be restored in infected individuals is unknown. To address this question, chimpanzees with persistent HCV infection were treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. A significant reduction in HCV viremia was observed in one of three treated animals without apparent hepatocellular injury. Viremia rebounded in the responder animal when antibody treatment was discontinued. Control of HCV replication was associated with restoration of intrahepatic CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell immunity against multiple HCV proteins. The responder animal had a history of broader T-cell immunity to multiple HCV proteins than the two chimpanzees that did not respond to PD-1 therapy. The results suggest that successful PD-1 blockade likely requires a critical threshold of preexisting virus-specific T cells in liver and warrants consideration of therapeutic vaccination strategies in combination with PD-1 blockade to broaden narrow responses. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy may also facilitate control of other persistent viruses, notably the hepatitis B virus where options for long-term control of virus replication are limited. "
876,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, a cross-sectional case-control study was conducted on 301 HAT patients recruited in the main foci of the country. For each HAT patient, 3 controls, matched for sex, age and residence, were selected. Data relating to socio-demographic factors and potential risk factors for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and HIV infections were obtained, and serum samples were collected for HIV-1 and HIV-2 tests. A positive test consisted of enzyme immunoassay reactive to HIV-1, HIV-2 or both and confirmed by a synthetic peptide test or Western blot. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression with EGRET software. No statistically significant difference was found between the prevalence of HIV infection in HAT patients and controls (4.3% and 3.5% respectively; crude odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-2.50). In multivariate analysis, allowance for 5 covariates did not change the association between the 2 infections (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.64-2.52). Although this study had limited statistical power, no significant association was found between HIV infection and T.b. gambiense infection in rural Côte d'Ivoire. Studies are needed to determine whether HIV infection influences the clinical course of HAT, a question not addressed in the present study."
8166,0.005,1.0000,"Increased treatment options that are more efficacious and safe and new knowledge on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have expanded the indications for therapy in hepatitis B. The question is no longer ""Who should be treated?"" but ""When should treatment be initiated?"" Treatment is clearly indicated in patients with life-threatening liver disease (acute liver failure, decompensated cirrhosis, or severe hepatitis flare) and in those with compensated cirrhosis and high levels of serum HBV DNA. For patients with precirrhotic liver disease, treatment indications should be based on clinical, biochemical, or histological evidence of liver disease, such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, abnormal histology, and high levels of serum HBV DNA. The cutoff for ALT and HBV DNA values are constantly being revised and should be set at a lower level for older patients who may have been infected for a longer period of time. High serum HBV DNA levels persisting for a few decades are associated with increased risk of clinical outcomes, but there is insufficient data to support the initiation of treatment based on high serum HBV DNA alone, particularly in young patients, those with persistently normal ALT levels, and those with a single high HBV DNA level. The decision to initiate treatment at the time of assessment or to defer treatment should take into consideration other factors such as desire to start a family, occupational requirement, family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, access to care and insurance coverage, and commitment to long-term treatment and medication compliance. All patients who are not initiated on treatment should continue to be monitored so treatment can be started if and when the indication arises."
8038,0.005,1.0000,"Older HIV infected subjects were previously found to have significant B cell expansion during initial antiretroviral therapy in a prospective age-differentiated cohort of older and younger (≥45 vs. ≤30 years) HIV-infected subjects initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. Here to further describe this expansion, using a subset of subjects from the same cohort, we characterized B cell phenotypes at baseline and after 192 weeks of ART in both older and younger HIV-infected groups and compared them to uninfected age-matched controls. We also examined whether phenotypes at baseline associated with response to tetanus and hepatitis A vaccine at 12 weeks. Forty six subjects were analyzed in the HIV infected group (21 older, 25 younger) and 30 in the control group (15 per age group). We observed naïve B cells to normalize in younger subjects after 192 weeks of ART, while in older subjects naïve B cells increased to greater levels than those of controls (p = 0.045). Absolute resting memory (RM) cell count was significantly lower in the older HIV infected group at baseline compared to controls and numbers normalized after 192 weeks of ART (p<0.001). Baseline RM cell count positively correlated with week 12 increase in antibody to tetanus vaccine among both younger and older HIV-infected subjects combined (p = 0.01), but not in controls. The age-associated naïve B cell expansion is a novel finding and we discuss several possible explanations for this observation. Relationship between RM cells at baseline and tetanus responses may lead to insights about the effects of HIV infection on B cell memory function and vaccine responses. "
3190,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to determine the degree of clonal expansion of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients suffering from different clinical types of hepatitis B (HB) infection and to analyse the clinical relevance of the skewed T-cell receptor beta variable (TCRBV). Sera and PBMCs were collected from 90 HB patients. Gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) analysis was used to determine the distribution and expansion of populations expressing specific TCRBV complementary determined region 3 (CDR3) genes. TCRBV genes associated with monoclonal expansion were sequenced. TCRBV families from the majority of patients (80/90) displayed skewed T-cell expansion. Furthermore, TCRBV11, BV12 and BV13.1 were more frequent than other TCRBV genes; the sequence of TCRBV11 CDR3 was expressed as 'VYNEQ' in all patients and was accompanied by the BJ2.1 fragment. In patients with chronic HB, the frequency of skewed TCRBV was inversely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. The persistently skewed TCRBV gene families in HB patients may be associated with the development and maintenance of hepatitis. GMSP analysis of TCRBV gene families may be helpful in estimating disease status, and BV11 may be associated with HBV replication in patients with chronic HBV infection."
3703,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are associated with persistent immune killing of infected hepatocytes. Hepatocytes constitute a largely self-renewing population. Thus, immune killing may exert selective pressure on the population, leading it to evolve in order to survive. A gradual course of hepatocyte evolution toward an HBV-resistant state is suggested by the substantial decline in the fraction of infected hepatocytes that occurs during the course of chronic infections. Consistent with hepatocyte evolution, clones of >1,000 hepatocytes develop postinfection in the noncirrhotic livers of chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV and of woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (W. S. Mason, A. R. Jilbert, and J. Summers, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 102:1139-1144, 2005; W. S. Mason et al., J. Virol. 83:8396-8408, 2009). The present study was carried out to determine (i) if extensive clonal expansion of hepatocytes also occurred in human HBV carriers, particularly in the noncirrhotic liver, and (ii) if clonal expansion included normal-appearing hepatocytes, not just hepatocytes that appear premalignant. Host DNA extracted from fragments of noncancerous liver, collected during surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), was analyzed by inverse PCR for randomly integrated HBV DNA as a marker of expanding hepatocyte lineages. This analysis detected extensive clonal expansion of hepatocytes, as previously found in chronically infected chimpanzees and woodchucks. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and DNA was extracted from the adjacent section for inverse PCR to detect integrated HBV DNA. This analysis revealed that clonal expansion can occur among normal-appearing human hepatocytes."

The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."

Prolonged activation and expansion of immunoregulatory cells have been thought to play a role. We determined immune cell subset frequency in contemporaneous liver and peripheral blood samples from chronic HCV-infected and HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and biopsy-derived liver-infiltrating lymphocytes from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 10 chronic HCV-infected and 10 HIV-infected individuals were assessed for various subsets of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cell, natural killer (NK) cell and NK T-cell frequency by flow cytometry. CD8(+) T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1 were increased in HCV-infected individuals compared with uninfected individuals (P = 0.02), and HIV coinfection enhanced this effect (P = 0.005). In the liver, regulatory CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells, as well as CD4(+) CD25(+) PD1(+) T cells, were more frequent in HIV/HCV-coinfected than in HCV-monoinfected samples (P < 0.001). HCV was associated with increased regulatory T cells, PD-1(+) T cells and decreased memory B cells, regardless of HIV infection (P ≤ 0.005 for all). Low CD8(+) expression was observed only in PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells from HCV-infected individuals and healthy controls (P = 0.002) and was associated with enhanced expansion of exhausted CD8(+) T cells when exposed in vitro to PHA or CMV peptides. In conclusion, in HIV/HCV coinfection, ongoing HCV replication is associated with increased regulatory and exhausted T cells in the periphery and liver that may impact control of HCV. Simultaneous characterization of liver and peripheral blood highlights the disproportionate intrahepatic compartmentalization of immunoregulatory T cells, which may contribute to establishment of chronicity and hepatic fibrogenesis in HIV coinfection."
2862,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA status in the liver when hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has developed, 35 paired nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues from 27 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-seropositive and 8 HBsAg-negative patients with HCC were studied by Southern blot analysis. The hybridization patterns of HBV DNA were different in the nontumor and tumor parts in 26 (96.3%) of the 27 HBsAg-positive patients. In the nontumor parts, integration of HBV DNA into the host genome was significantly less when compared to the tumor parts (15/27 vs. 25/27, P less than 0.05), whereas free replicative viral forms were significantly more frequent (17/27 vs. 7/27). The integrated HBV DNA in the nontumor parts showed discrete band patterns in the majority of cases (13/15). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was significantly associated with the expression of free replicative forms of HBV DNA in the tumor tissues. An integrated HBV DNA sequence was detected in the tumor part of one HBsAg-negative patient, but not in her nontumor counterpart. Our observation that discrete integrated HBV DNAs are present in the nontumor part, representing subclinical clonal expansion that precedes the development of HCC, suggests the risk of future new tumor growth from these cell clones."
714,0.005,1.0000,"The effect of hepatic impairment on lopinavir/ritonavir pharmacokinetics was investigated. Twenty-four HIV-1-infected subjects received lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily prior to and during the study: 6 each with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (and hepatitis C virus coinfected) and 12 with normal hepatic function. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed similar effects on lopinavir pharmacokinetics. When the 2 hepatic impairment groups were combined, lopinavir Cmax and AUC12 were increased 20% to 30% compared to the controls. Hepatic impairment increased unbound lopinavir AUC12 by 68% and Cmax by 56%. The effect of hepatic impairment on low-dose ritonavir pharmacokinetics was more pronounced in the moderate impairment group (181% and 221% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively) than in the mild impairment group (39% and 61% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively). While lopinavir/ritonavir dose reduction is not recommended in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in this population."

We evaluated the severity of liver histology and the presence of histological indication for treatment in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection focusing on those with low viremia and/or normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In total, 399 patients with increased ALT and detectable serum HBV DNA (chronic hepatitis B patients) and 35 cases with persistently normal ALT and HBV DNA >2,000 IU/mL (inactive carriers) were included. Histological indication for treatment (grading score >or=7 and/or stage >or=2 in Ishak's classification) was found in 91% (185/203), 82% (75/91), 75% (47/63), and 62% (26/42) of chronic hepatitis B patients with HBV DNA >or=200,000, 20,000-199,999, 2,000-19,999, and <2,000 IU/mL, respectively (P < 0.001). Histological indication for treatment was more frequent in chronic hepatitis B patients with persistently elevated ALT (86% or 275/321), but it was also found in 74% (58/78) of those with transiently normal ALT (P = 0.025). All inactive carriers had HBV DNA <20,000 IU/mL.

3039,0.005,1.0000,"Rectal mucosal biopsy specimens from 75 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and 16 HIV-seronegative subjects were examined. The histopathologic changes were correlated with immunoperoxidase staining for UCHL-1 and HIV core protein p24, quantitative p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay in homogenized rectal tissue and serum, and a modified Walter Reed clinical stage. Four phases were seen in the HIV-infected subjects: (1) early phase, in Walter Reed stage 1-2 subjects, with nearly normal histology and low p24; (2) inflammatory phase, typically in Walter Reed stage 3-4 subjects, with a superficial lamina propria infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils with degranulation, abundant UCHL-1 staining, and maximal p24 by both immunoperoxidase staining and ELISA; (3) transitional phase, in many Walter Reed 5 and some Walter Reed 6 subjects, with normal lymphocyte population density but with subtle inflammatory changes; and (4) lymphoid depletion phase, mainly in Walter Reed stage 6 subjects, with decreased lymphocytes but often with endothelial cell activation and apoptosis. These phases presumably result from effective HIV suppression by a relatively intact immune system, followed by maximal HIV infection and lymphocyte activation, then progressive lymphocyte depletion. The inflammation correlated with the presence and amount of HIV in rectal tissue determined by immunohistochemistry and ELISA and was maximal before overt immunodeficiency developed. Intestinal mucosa could be a preferred site of HIV proliferation and T-cell destruction."

Whole blood chemiluminescence (CL) assays were used to measure the respiratory burst capacity of phagocytes from HIV-infected children, perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected children, and normal healthy children. Phagocytes were stimulated by zymosan opsonized with human complement with and without priming by platelet-activating factor (PAF) or FMLP. Activities of enzymes involved in the respiratory burst, oxidase and myeloperoxidase, were examined after opsonin receptor-independent stimulation with PMA. Unprimed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased for HIV-infected children with severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression compared with healthy children (P=.03), and PAF-primed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased in HIV-infected children with both moderate and severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively), despite normal or increased activities of the respiratory burst enzymes. These impairments may contribute to secondary bacterial infections."
678,0.005,1.0000,"Sera from 31 patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and 18 patients with acute hepatitis delta virus infection were examined for IgA class antibodies to this virus using a newly developed enzyme immunoassay. IgA antibody to hepatitis D virus was detected in 21 (67.7%) of 31 patients with chronic delta viral hepatitis, but in only 1 (5.6%) of the 18 patients with acute infection (p less than 0.0005). Of the 21 patients with chronic delta hepatitis with IgA antibody to hepatitis D virus, 19 (90.5%) had moderate-to-severe activity on liver biopsy: 18 of the 21 had histological features of chronic active hepatitis and three had chronic lobular hepatitis. In all, 23 patients with chronic delta hepatitis had moderate-to-severe activity, and 19 (82.6%) had IgA antibody to hepatitis D virus. No statistically significant correlations were found between IgA antibody to hepatitis D virus and biochemical markers of liver injury (p greater than 0.4), or the presence of hepatitis delta virus antigen in liver biopsies (p greater than 0.2), in the patients with chronic delta hepatitis. The finding that IgA antibody to hepatitis D virus was almost exclusively associated with chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and correlated independently with moderate-to-severe histological activity (with a specificity of 90.5% and a sensitivity of 82.6%) suggests that this antibody might be a useful serological marker of underlying liver damage in chronic delta hepatitis."
8949,0.005,1.0000,"Mild-to-moderate tobacco smoking is highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals, and is known to exacerbate HIV pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine the specific effects of mild-to-moderate smoking on viral load, cytokine production, and oxidative stress and cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways in HIV-infected individuals who have not yet received antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thirty-two human subjects were recruited and assigned to four different cohorts as follows: a) HIV negative non-smokers, b) HIV positive non-smokers, c) HIV negative mild-to-moderate smokers, and d) HIV positive mild-to-moderate smokers. Patients were recruited in Cameroon, Africa using strict selection criteria to exclude patients not yet eligible for ART and not receiving conventional or traditional medications. Those with active tuberculosis, hepatitis B or with a history of substance abuse were also excluded. Our results showed an increase in the viral load in the plasma of HIV positive patients who were mild-to-moderate smokers compared to individuals who did not smoke. Furthermore, although we did not observe significant changes in the levels of most pro-inflammatory cytokines, the cytokine IL-8 and MCP-1 showed a significant decrease in the plasma of HIV-infected patients and smokers compared with HIV negative non-smokers. Importantly, HIV-infected individuals and smokers showed a significant increase in oxidative stress compared with HIV negative non-smoker subjects in both plasma and monocytes. To examine the possible pathways involved in increased oxidative stress and viral load, we determined the mRNA levels of several antioxidant and cytochrome P450 enzymes in monocytes. The results showed that the levels of most antioxidants are unaltered, suggesting their inability to counter oxidative stress. While CYP2A6 was induced in smokers, CYP3A4 was induced in HIV and HIV positive smokers compared with HIV negative non-smokers. Overall, the findings suggest a possible association of oxidative stress and perhaps CYP pathway with smoking-mediated increased viral load in HIV positive individuals. "
7887,0.005,1.0000,"Twenty four patients who were HBsAg positive prior to renal transplantation were studied with respect to their hepatic and renal outcome. The kidneys in all patients were obtained from living related donors. The standard immunosuppressive therapy consisted of azathioprine and prednisolone. Post-renal transplant follow-up varied from 32-86 months (mean 55 +/- 9). Renal functions, liver functions, HBsAg and HBsAb status was closely monitored during follow-up. One patient developed acute hepatitis four months after transplantation; this resolved in 10 weeks. Four patients showed transient elevations of liver enzymes. The results of liver biopsy in 16 cases revealed, normal histology (8), virus in hepatocytes (5), and acute hepatitis (3). None of the patients had evidence of chronic liver disease. Two patients died due to chronic rejection/chronic renal failure and two patients died due to septicaemia. Five living patients have mild to moderate chronic rejection. It was concluded that pre-existing HBsAg carrier state in transplant patients had no deteriorating effect on the liver. The mortality was related to chronic rejection and septicaemia."

The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."

Figures for HIV prevalence are among the highest in the world, but the number of people receiving treatment is very small. Economic and political factors contribute to this important health crisis. Opportunistic diseases as a whole and their relative frequencies of presentation in southern Africa are discussed, emphasizing the lead role of tuberculosis. The limited data that do exist regarding neurological complications in Zimbabwe are summarized, and combined with anecdotal experience from practicing clinicians. Opportunistic infections in the nervous system are very common, the most important being cryptococcal meningitis, causing half of all adult meningitis in the country. Tuberculous and bacterial meningitis have also become more common and carry a high mortality in HIV-infected people in Zimbabwe. Intracranial mass lesions, including tuberculoma, bacterial abscesses and toxoplasmosis encephalitis are less common and difficult to diagnose in the absence of stereotactic biopsy. Spinal tuberculosis and transverse myelitis are the most frequent causes of spinal cord opportunistic infections. Peripheral neuropathy is probably similar in presentation to that seen elsewhere, whereas dementia is less frequently recognized."

This cross sectional study was an attempt to determine the level and factors associated with HQoL among the people living with HIV. A convenient sample of 82 HIV-infected people from three NGOs and one Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), were interviewed using an interviewer administered, semi structured questionnaire developed by adopting the ""WHOQOL-HIV BREF instrument"". A majority of the respondents were with low Quality of Life (QoL) in all the domains of HQoL. The proportion of respondents with low QoL was highest in the domain of social relationship (64.6%) followed by psychological domain (59.8%), physical domain (58.5%), level of independence domain (56.1%), environmental domain (52.4%) and spirituality domain (52.4%) of HQoL. Bivariate analysis revealed that the overall perception of QoL was better in the respondents living in urban area, who were employed and asymptomatic of the centre for disease control (CDC) stage of HIV. The perception of overall health was higher in females, all respondents less than 35 years of age, asymptomatic of the CDC stage of disease and with a current CD4 count greater than 200 cell/mm3. These findings highlight the need for enhanced socio-psychosocial support and a better environment for improving the health related quality of life among people living with HIV."

These complications frequently manifest themselves within the gastrointestinal tract and endoscopic biopsies may contribute to their diagnosis. The results of 63 such biopsies from 28 patients are reviewed in this study. The diagnoses made included: upper gastrointestinal tract candidiasis (n = 6); cytomegalovirus infection of large intestine (n = 2); cryptosporidiosis (n = 1); spirochaetosis (n = 2); Kaposi's sarcoma (n = 4); malignant lymphoma (n = 3); and anal carcinoma (n = 2). Many of the specimens also showed inflammatory changes with no demonstrable aetiological agent. No specific pattern could be recognized for HIV infection per se.
6815,0.005,1.0000,"This study aims to determine the relationship among cerebral metabolite concentrations (on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy or (1)H MRS), cognitive function, and clinical variables (CD4, plasma and CSF viral loads, and lipids) in antiretroviral medication-nai;ve HIV patients. We hypothesized that the probable glial markers myo-inositol [MI] and choline compounds [CHO] would correlate with cognitive function, CD4 count, and viral loads, but not with serum lipids. Forty-five antiretroviral-drug-nai;ve HIV patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated. Frontal lobe [MI], [CHO], and total creatine [CR] were elevated, while basal ganglia [CR] were decreased, with increasing dementia severity. As a group, HIV patients showed slowing on fine motor (Grooved Pegboard) and psychomotor function (Trails A & B), and deficits on executive function (Stroop tasks). Lower CD4 counts and elevated plasma viral loads were associated with elevated frontal white matter [MI], which in turn correlated with the Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that systemic factors (resulting from suppressed immune function and higher plasma viral load) may lead to glial proliferation (elevated [MI], [CHO], and [CR]) in the frontal white matter, which in turn may contribute to deficits on executive function in HIV. Studying antiretroviral-nai;ve patients minimized the confounding effects of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical, MRS, and neuropsychological variables, and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the relationships among these measurements. Metabolite concentrations, rather than metabolite ratios, should be measured since [CR], a commonly used reference for metabolite ratios, varies with disease severity in both frontal lobe and basal ganglia."

Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."
991,0.005,1.0000,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversions have been considered as outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of needle exchange programs. To assess the relationships between incident HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs), seroconversions were prospectively studied among a cohort of 240 HBV- and HIV- seronegative IDUs. The incidence of HBV seroconversion declined from 24.41/100 person-years in 1988 to 0 seroconversions in 1992. In contrast, HIV seroconversion rates varied little from the overall rate of 3.29/100 person-years. HBV seroconversion predicted subsequent HIV seroconversion among male IDUs (relative incidence [RI]= 4.23) but not among female IDUs (RI=0.86). Because of different transmission dynamics, HBV seroconversion probably has limited utility as a surrogate outcome measure for incident HIV. However, HBV seroconversion itself is an appropriate and important outcome measure for evaluation of prevention programs among IDUs."

The incidence of HZ in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era (17.21 per 100 PY) was significantly higher than that in the post-HAART era (5.05 per 100 PY) (P < 0.0001). In the first six months of enrollment, the incidence of HZ was significantly higher than that between six and 12 months both in the pre-HAART (27.65 per 100 PY versus 8.43 per 100 PY, P = 0.02) and post-HAART era (17.79 per 100 PY versus 3.39 per 100 PY, P < 0.0001). In multivariate analyses, only baseline CD4+ count remained a significant risk factor associated with HZ. HZ did not increase mortality rate either in the pre-HAART or post-HAART era, although the risk for HIV progression was significantly higher in patients with HZ (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.747, 95% confidence interval, 1.037-2.943). We conclude that the incidence of HZ was highest in the first six months of enrollment in patients at late stage of HIV infection, which did not increase with the introduction of HAART. Baseline CD4+ lymphocyte count was the most significant risk factor associated with development of HZ. HZ was associated with increased risk for HIV progression, but not mortality."
2302,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains has evolved through mutations such as point mutations, deletions or insertions, and recombination. We identified and characterized a novel type of mutation which is a complex of external insertion, deletion, and internal duplication in sequences from one of six patients with chronic hepatitis B virus genotype E (HBV/E). We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."

Survival in HIV infected individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has improved since the introduction of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Current experience in renal transplantation in HIV-infected patients in the United States indicates that the three-year survival rate is similar to that of HIV-negative transplant recipients, with virological and immunological control of the infection by HAART and no increase in the number of opportunistic infections or tumors. The criteria for selecting renal transplantation candidates in this population are the following: no aids-defining events, CD4 cells > 200 cells/.l and undetectable viral load under HAART. In Spain, where most of these patients are former drug abusers, a two-year period of abstinence from cocaine and heroine abuse is also required, although patients can be participating in the methadone program. The main problems in the post-transplantation period have been interactions between HAART and immunosuppressive drugs, management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and the high rate of acute rejection. To date, seven such renal transplantations have been performed in Spain, with favorable patient and graft survival and no progression to aids."

Overall, we found that HIV-positive patients with CD4(+)-cell counts of between 200 and 400/microl had significantly more yeast colonization than healthy control subjects. Of the 54 patients, 11 developed thrush. We found that intensity of carriage in these 11 patients increased significantly in the progression from asymptomatic yeast carrier to an episode of oral thrush. Also, the most common yeast species isolated was Candida albicans; however, we did see a number of patients harboring multiple species at the same time. Using the C. albicans-specific probe Ca3, we found that 54% (n = 6) of the 11 patients who developed thrush maintained genetically similar strains throughout the study period, with minor genetic variations in all patients except one. Forty-six percent of these patients had either multiple strains throughout the study period (n = 2), strain replacement (n = 1), or species replacement (n = 2). Of the patients who had multiple strains, one (I4) was infected by two different strains of Candida dubliniensis distinguished by a recently developed species-specific probe.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."

Although such infections have been identified in patients with chronic hepatitis C, the clinical significance of those co-infections is still not understood. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the prevalence and clinical consequences of occult HBV infection in chronic hepatitis C patients undergoing antiviral therapy."
8807,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a type of recently identified chronic infection that is evidenced only by detection of HCV RNA in liver; patients consistently test negative for antibodies to HCV and HCV RNA in serum. Using ex vivo and in vitro measures of T-cell responses, we have identified functional virus-specific memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with occult HCV infection. The features of the virus-specific T cells were consistent with immune surveillance functions, supporting previous exposure to HCV. In addition, the magnitudes of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were in parallel and correlated inversely with the extent of liver HCV infection. The detection of HCV-specific T cells in individuals in whom HCV RNA can persist in the liver despite the absence of viremia and antibodies indicates that HCV replication is prolonged in the face of virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses. These findings demonstrate that HCV-specific cellular immune responses are markers not only of previous exposure to and recovery from HCV but also of ongoing occult HCV infection."
2029,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is characterized by HBV DNA positivity but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negativity. Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea. "
5723,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver tissue and/or serum of subjects seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult HBV infection of hemodialysis (HD) patients is informative in terms of virus transmission, reactivation after kidney transplantation, and the progression of liver disease. However, there is little detailed information about occult HBV infection in the context of virus endemicity. We tried to investigate the seroprevalence and clinical features of occult HBV infection in HD patients in HBV-endemic regions. We enrolled a total of 159 HD patients and 121 apparently healthy subjects at Dankook University Hospital and Jeju National University Hospital in Korea. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Serum levels of HBV DNA were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The seroprevalence of occult HBV infection was 1.3% in HD patients and 2.5% in the healthy controls. This difference was not significant. The HBV load in all subjects with occult infection was <116 copies/mL, and all were positive for IgG anti-HBc, regardless of the presence of anti-HBs. None of the occult HBV-infected subjects were co-infected with HCV. One of the 2 HD patients with occult HBV infection had no history of blood transfusion. In this HBV-endemic region, the seroprevalence of occult HBV infection in HD patients with a very low viral load was not significantly different from that in apparently healthy subjects. "

731,0.005,1.0000,"Children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer. Studies aimed at understanding the health and well-being of these children as they age into adolescence are enhanced by research designs that include appropriate comparison groups. HIV-exposed but uninfected children are one such comparison group; however, recruitment of this comparison group is challenging because uninfected children may no longer be followed at tertiary care centres, and some may be in foster care or no longer living with their biological parents. This paper describes the recruitment methods, sampling plan, and factors associated with enrolling perinatally HIV-infected children and a comparison group of HIV-exposed but uninfected children into the HIV Follow-up Of Perinatally Exposed Children (PACTS-HOPE) prospective cohort study. The source population consists of HIV-infected and uninfected children originally enrolled in the Perinatal AIDS Collaborative Transmission Study (PACTS). Recruitment took place at paediatric HIV clinics in four US locations between March 2001 and March 2003. A total of 182 HIV-infected and 180 uninfected children were enrolled. Enrolment of uninfected children was much harder than that of infected children because the former often could not be located. After adjusting for site and birth-year category, uninfected children born to white mothers were significantly less likely to be enrolled (P < 0.01). There was a trend for infected and uninfected children of mothers with a history of injection drug use to enrol at lower rates. Although recruitment of the uninfected comparison group was challenging, it was nevertheless facilitated by hierarchical recruitment techniques, involvement of family networks, and continuity of study staff. The PACTS-HOPE cohort will provide opportunities for future research aimed at understanding the unique effects of HIV on the well-being of HIV-infected children."

A cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to February 2015 in 67 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) patients. Blood collected from these patients was used to perform cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) lymphocyte blood counts and a white blood cell count, as well as to measure C-reactive protein (CRP) blood by flow cytometry and perform optical and immuno-turbidimetric detection. Enteric bacteria were isolated from the stool of patients, and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined using agar diffusion methods. The results showed that Escherichia coli was the main pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tracts of HIV+ (85.3%) and HIV- (81.1%) patients, and infections with Klebsiella sp. were also predominant among HIV- patients (29.4%). Resistance of Klebsiella sp. to ceftriaxone (CRO; P=0.001), gentamicin (GEN; P=0.005), chloramphenicol (CHL; P=0.0004), ciprofloxacin (CIP; P=0.005) and doxycycline (DOX; P<0.0001) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Enterobacter sp. showed high resistance to GEN (P=0.009) and CIP (P=0.001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Citrobacter sp. was resistant to GEN (P=0.009) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Salmonella sp. showed high resistance to CHL (P<0.0001) and DOX (P<0.0001) in HIV+ patients compared to HIV- patients. Resistance of Serratia sp. to AMO (P=0.005), AMC (P=0.005) and CHL (P=0.005) was significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV- patients. Lymphopenia was higher in HIV+ patients (36.8%) than in HIV- patients (2.7%). In 45.9% of the HIV- patients, the CRP rate was higher than 6mg/L compared to 16.2% in HIV+ patients. In general, bacterial multi-drug resistance in HIV+ patients (79.4%) was significantly higher (P<0.0001) than in HIV- patients (29.7%). The present study revealed that the resistance profiles of bacteria should be considered in HIV-infected patients to improve their health care."
2019,0.005,1.0000,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."

9696,0.005,1.0000,"Factors explaining why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhances the risk of reactivated tuberculosis (TB) are poorly understood. Unfortunately, experimental models of HIV-induced reactivated TB are lacking. We examined whether cynomolgus macaques, which accurately model latent TB in humans, could be used to model pathogenesis of HIV infection in the lungs and associated lymph nodes. These experiments precede studies modeling the effects of HIV infection on latent TB. We infected two groups of macaques with chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV-89.6P and SHIV-KU2) and followed viral titers and immunologic parameters including lymphocytes numbers and phenotype in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lymph nodes over the course of infection. Tissues from the lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, and lymph nodes were similarly examined at necropsy. Both strains produced dramatic CD4(+) T cell depletion. Plasma titers were not different between viruses, but we found more SHIV-89.6P in the lungs. Both viruses induced similar patterns of cell activation markers. SHIV-89.6P induced more IFN-gamma expression than SHIV-KU2. These results indicate SHIV-89.6P and SHIV-KU2 infect cynomolgus macaques and may be used to accurately model effects of HIV infection on latent TB."

This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65 years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P < 0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ages below 30 years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30 years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."
6248,0.005,1.0000,"Patients undergoing bronchoscopy for possible pneumocystis pneumonia were studied retrospectively to characterize the impact of common viral pathogens on the course of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and atypical pneumonia. In 327 episodes, Pneumocystis carinii was found in 220 (67%), cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 145 (44%), and herpes simplex virus in 16 (5%). Early deterioration in oxygenation and use of intensive care was less common in CMV-positive patients. Neither CMV nor P. carinii was a predictor of mortality in multivariate analyses. CMV was not associated with an increased prevalence of later CMV disease. Isolation of CMV from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of these patients was not an indication for antiviral therapy. Pulmonary shedding of CMV may be associated with a decreased inflammatory response to P. carinii. The outcome of HIV-associated atypical pneumonia where no clear pulmonary pathogen is found on routine evaluation was no better than that of treated P. carinii pneumonia."
7450,0.005,1.0000,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
4134,0.005,1.0000,"The state of activation of the immune system may be an important factor which renders a host more receptive to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and more vulnerable to its effects. To explore this issue with a practical in vivo model, we developed a modified protocol of HIV infection in hu-PBL-SCID mice. First, we assessed the time course of activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-PBL) in the peritoneal cavity of SCID mice. At 2 to 24 h after the intraperitoneal injection into SCID mice, there was a clear-cut increase in the percentage of hu-PBL expressing early activation markers (CD69), concomitant with the release of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and the soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and with the accumulation of mRNAs for a number of human cytokines. At 2 weeks, virtually all of the hu-PBL expressed the memory phenotype (CD45RO) and HLA-DR antigens as well. Cells collected from the SCID mouse peritoneum at 2 and 24 h after transplantation were fully susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in the absence of either IL-2 or mitogens. The injection of HIV into hu-PBL-SCID mice at 2 h after reconstitution resulted in a generalized and productive HIV infection of the xenochimeras. This early HIV-1 infection resulted in a dramatic depletion of human CD4+ cells and in decreased levels of sICAM-1 (in the peritoneal lavage fluid) as well as of sIL-2R and immunoglobulins M and A (in the serum). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed higher levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 in the HIV-infected animals than in control hu-PBL-SCID mice, while gamma interferon levels in the two groups were comparable. When we compared the current model of HIV-1 infection at 2 weeks after the intraperitoneal injection of the hu-PBL in the SCID mice with the model described here, we found that the majority of immune dysfunctions induced in the 2-h infection of the xenochimeras are not inducible in the 2-week infection. This supports the concept that the state of activation of human cells at the moment of the in vivo infection with HIV-1 is a crucial factor in determining the immune derangement observed in AIDS patients. These results show that some immunological dysfunctions induced by HIV infection in AIDS patients can be mimicked in this xenochimeric model. Thus, the hu-PBL-SCID mouse model may be useful in exploring, in vivo, the relevance of hu-PBL activation and differentiation in HIV-1 infection and for testing therapeutic intervention directed towards either the virus or the immune system."

The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

This cross-sectional study presents data from a reference HIV-outpatient service in Dourados (Brazil) that evaluated the association between depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic factors in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients. Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 61% with a predominance of self-deprecating and cognitive-affective factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with lower income (p=0.019) and disadvantaged social class (p=0.005). Poorer quality of life was related to depressive symptoms (p<0.0001), low educational level (p=0.05), and lower income (p=0.03).

Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."

Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."

Infant oropharyngeal aspirates obtained at birth were examined for HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nine infants (41%) had detectable levels of HIV-1 RNA, 3 of which were quantifiable (mean, 3000 copies/mL). This mucosal exposure to HIV-1 during delivery did not lead to infection of any infant. Cesarian delivery did not reduce mucosal exposure to HIV-1.

Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria.

AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is a severe form of this disease seen in 20 to 30% of terminally ill patients. The etiology of this complex is distinct from commonly observed opportunistic infections seen in brains of patients with AIDS and has been attributed to HIV infection within the brain. At autopsy, the brains of patients with ADC contain numerous HIV-infected macrophages/microglia with prominent subcortical damage, together termed HIV encephalitis. We retrospectively analyzed all 107 brains from a three-year period (1988-1990) of AIDS autopsies using immunocytochemistry to detect HIV. Rather than breaking into distinct groups of HIV encephalitis versus non-HIV encephalitis, the specimens revealed a spectrum of severity of HIV infection. Although only 16% of the brains showed the histological hallmarks of HIV encephalitis, more than 50% of the autopsies showed moderate to severe HIV infection. In a subset of 23 AIDS autopsies during which short postmortem times and absence of significant opportunistic infection permitted quantitative analysis of dendritic and synaptic complexities, we identified a strong correlation between neocortical dendritic and presynaptic damage and abundance of HIV envelope protein in the neocortical gray and deep white matter. This correlation suggests that the presence of HIV-1 in the neocortex may be responsible by direct or indirect mechanisms for dendritic and synaptic damage."

Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) have been smuggled into the country and available without prescription since the early 1990s, but are now provided free of cost by the government. We assessed the prevalence of HIV-1, drug resistance, and subtype distributions. Blood specimens were collected from HIV-1-infected participants registered in Sindh Province on dry blood spot (DBS) cards in 2008. Pol, protease, and partial reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. Primary drug resistance was analyzed by the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool using the Stanford Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation (SDRM) major mutation list. Out of 100 blood samples collected, 42 were suitable for testing. Out of 42, 11 were ARV-receiving and 31 ARV-naive patients. Among them, 24 were injection drug users (IDUs), four immigrants, two hijras (male transvestites), two men who have sex with men (MSM), four prisoners, one female sex workers, two spouses of HIV-infected persons, and four from the general population. ARV resistance among naive patients was 2/31 (6.5%) and 36.4% (4/11) among ARV-experienced patients making an overall resistance of 14.2%. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant subtype found in 35/42 (83.3%) followed by CRF35_AD and C, 6.5% each. Subtype D and G were found in one (2.4%) each. A significant proportion of Pakistani HIV patients has ARV drug resistance. Physicians treating patients should consider the magnitude of drug resistance while selecting regimens, and address drug adherence aggressively."
9399,0.005,1.0000,"Algeria is the largest country of Africa, with a population of 40 million inhabitants living in disparate environments from the Sahara to the large cities of the Mediterranean coast. The molecular epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants has been partially described, but variations in the seroprevalence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) throughout the Algerian territories are still poorly described. We analyzed demographic features of new cases of chronic infection collected in 41 administrative regions (covering 92% of the population) in 2013. The mean age of the 1876 HBsAg(+) patients was 36.8 ± 14.2 years, with a slight excess of males (54%). The seroprevalence of HBV early antigen (HBeAg) was 9.3%, and the mean virus load was 3.2 ± 1.8 log IU/ml. A subset of 15.2% of patients was already cirrhotic at disease discovery. An important heterogeneity was observed throughout the country, with nine regions displaying a significant excess of cases. These regions formed four distinct foci located in distant parts of the country: Adrar-Bechar (southwest), El-Oued-Tebessa (east), M'Sila-Sétif (north central) and Oran-Aïn Temouchent (northwest). An excess of cases was found as well in the national capital Algiers. Patients from southern regions with an excess of cases (Bechar, Adrar, El Oued) were significantly younger (32.0 ± 10.7 years), as were patients from the regions of Bejaia and Bouira (32.1 ± 10.6). The southwestern regions were also marked by a significant imbalance of the sex ratio (58 vs 39% of female cases, P = 4.5 E-5). The highest HBeAg seroprevalence was observed in Setif (26.4 vs. 7.6%, OR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.6-6.5, P = 1.1 × 10"
6065,0.005,1.0000,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."
5604,0.005,1.0000,"Patients' deaths due to the organ donor shortage make it imperative that every suitable organ be transplanted. False-positive results of tests for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) result in lost organs. A survey of US organ procurement organizations collected the numbers of donors and ruled-out potential donors who had a positive result on an HIV test from January 1,2006, to October 31, 2008. Sixty-two percent of US organ procurement organizations participated. Of the 12397 donor/nondonor cases, 56 (0.45%) had an initial positive result on an HIV antibody or HIV nucleic acid test, and only 8 (14.3%) of those were confirmed positive. Of the false-positive results, 50% were from HIV antibody tests and 50% were from HIV nucleic acid tests. Organs are a scarce, finite, and perishable resource. Use of HIV antibody testing has produced a remarkably safe track record of avoiding HIV transmission, with 22 years of nonoccurrence between transmissions. Because false positives occur with any test, including the HIV Ab test, adding nucleic acid testing to the standard donor testing panel doubles the number of false-positive HIV test results and thus the number of medically suitable donors lost. The required HIV antibody test is 99.99% effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus. Adding the HIV nucleic acid test to routine organ donor screening could result in as many as 761 to 1551 unnecessary deaths of patients between HIV transmission events because medically suitable organs are wasted."
1956,0.005,1.0000,"Accurate determination of plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels is critical for the effective management of HIV-1 disease. The AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, a reverse transcription-PCR-based test for quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, was developed when little sequence information on HIV-1 isolates from outside North America was available. It has since become apparent that many non-subtype B isolates, particularly subtypes A and E, are detected inefficiently by the test. We describe here the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test, version 1.5, an upgraded test developed to minimize subtype-related variation. We also developed a panel of HIV-1 standards containing 30 HIV-1 isolates of subtypes A through G. The virus particle concentration of each cultured viral stock was standardized by electron microscopic virus particle counting. We used this panel to determine the performance of the original AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test and version 1.5 of the test with HIV-1 subtypes A through G. The original test underestimated the concentration of HIV-1 subtype A, E, F, and G RNA by 10-fold or more, whereas version of the 1.5 test yielded equivalent quantification of HIV-1 RNA regardless of the subtype. In light of the increasing intermixing of HIV-1 subtypes worldwide, standardization of PCR-based tests against well-characterized viral isolates representing the full range of HIV-1 diversity will be essential for the continued utility of these important clinical management tools."
8238,0.005,1.0000,"The care of the HIV-infected patient in the emergency department has changed since the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy. This therapy has resulted in longer life expectancies and increased quality of life for HIV-infected patients, and in cases of treatment compliance and success, virtual elimination of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. As a result, the emergency clinician is now more often confronted with adverse events related to medication and the diseases associated with aging and chronic disease. This issue focuses on the differences in evaluation of HIV patients on long-term therapy and patients with medication noncompliance and low CD4 counts, as well as recognition of life-threatening and rare opportunistic infections. Disease processes related to the effect of longstanding HIV infection, even with good control, on many organ systems are addressed. "
6239,0.005,1.0000,"Information about the relationship between pharmacological parameters and an early virological response to tipranavir (TPV) is scarce. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who had received TPV as part of a salvage regimen were analyzed retrospectively. A virological response was defined as a decline in the HIV RNA level of > or = 1 log unit or to <50 copies/ml between weeks 4 and 12 of therapy. The virtual inhibitory quotient (vIQ) was calculated as the ratio of the TPV plasma trough concentration (C(trough))/virtual change in the 50% inhibitory concentration. Three genotypic inhibitory quotients (gIQs) were calculated by using different TPV resistance mutation scores (from the International AIDS Society-USA [IAS-USA], Randomized Evaluation of Strategic Intervention in Multidrug-Resistant Patients with Tipranavir [RESIST], and Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hépatites Virales [ANRS] trials). The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and likelihood ratios for a positive result (LHR+) and a negative result (LHR-) [LHR+ = sensitivity/(1-specificity); LHR- = (1-sensitivity)/specificity] were calculated. A total of 57 HIV-infected patients were analyzed. A virological response was achieved by 77% of the patients. TPV resistance mutations, TPV C(trough), vIQs, and gIQs were all significantly associated with a virological response. The vIQ had the best PPV and NPV (97% and 78%, respectively). The values of the LHR+ were 7.8 for vIQ, 3.4 for the RESIST gIQ, 3.3 for the IAS-USA gIQ, 3.1 for the ANRS gIQ, 2.2 for TPV C(trough), and 1.3 for the IAS-USA and RESIST scores. The values of LHR- were 0 for the RESIST score, 0.07 for vIQ, 0.09 for the IAS-USA score, 0.27 for the RESIST gIQ, 0.32 for the IAS-USA gIQ, 0.37 for the ANRS gIQ, and 0.48 for TPV C(trough). HIV-infected patients who initiate a salvage regimen based on TPV may benefit from baseline drug resistance testing and TPV plasma concentration determination, as vIQ is the best predictor of a virological response."
629,0.005,1.0000,"This study examined whether there are neuropsychological performance differences between human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive participants being followed at a University of Zambia clinic and demographically comparable seronegative controls being tested for infection in the same setting. All participants were administered a standardized neurocognitive test battery that has been found sensitive to HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder in the United States and internationally (e.g., in China, India, Romania, and Cameroon). The test battery was found to be applicable to a Zambian population. A clear HIV effect was seen with a medium to large overall effect size (Cohen d = 0.74). However, it was only the female seropositive participants who showed this HIV effect. HIV can result in neuropsychological deficits in Zambia, where clade C of the virus dominates. It is suggested that the HIV-infected women are more at risk of developing cognitive deficits than are men in this population, possibly because of sex-related social, financial, and healthcare disadvantages. However, further analyses are required regarding this conclusion because the finding was a result of an unplanned subanalysis."
7522,0.005,1.0000,"All 155 anti-hepatitis C-virus (HCV) positive patients with haemostatic disorders at our unit were tested for HCV-RNA in order to determine the prevalence of a negative result. The patients were also characterized in order to find predictors for a negative HCV-RNA test. The prevalence of a negative HCV-RNA test was 15.5% (24 of 155) and this was similar among anti-HIV positive and negative patients. A common denominator for the 4 HIV-infected, HCV-RNA negative haemophiliacs was treatment with azidothymidin prior to the first test. Among the anti-HIV negative patients, those < 40 y of age had a significantly greater chance of being HCV-RNA-negative than the older ones (27.3 vs 3.6%). They also had a lower consumption of plasma products than age-matched HCV-RNA positive cases. Absence of co-infection with hepatitis B was not correlated with a negative HCV-RNA test. Young age and a low requirement for factor concentrates thus seem to be predictors for a negative HCV-RNA test in patients with bleeding disorders."
5402,0.005,1.0000,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."

Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "
1659,0.005,1.0000,"Cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), in particular heparan sulfate (HS), have been proposed to mediate the attachment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to target cells prior to virus entry, and both the viral gp120 envelope protein and virion-associated cyclophilin A (CypA) have been shown to directly interact with HS and its analogues. To determine the role of GAGs in HIV attachment and infection, we generated HIV-susceptible derivatives of CHO cell lines that either express high levels of GAGs (CHO-K1) or lack GAGs (pgsA745). Using a panel of HIV-1 envelopes, we found that cell surface GAG-mediated effects on virion attachment and infection vary in an envelope strain-dependent but coreceptor-independent manner. In fact, cell surface GAG-mediated enhancement of infection is confined to isolates that contain a highly positively charged V3-loop sequence, while infection by most strains is apparently inhibited by the presence of GAGs. Moreover, the enhancing and inhibitory effects of polycations and polyanions on HIV-1 infection are largely dependent on the presence of cell surface GAGs. These observations are consistent with a model in which GAGs influence in vitro HIV-1 infection primarily by modifying the charge characteristics of the target cell surface. Finally, the effects of GAGs on HIV-1 infection are observed to an equivalent extent whether CypA is present in or absent from virions. Overall, these data exclude a major role for GAGs in mediating the attachment of many HIV-1 strains to target cells via interactions with virion-associated gp120 or CypA."
8434,0.005,1.0000,"A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials (1792 patients, 2947 patient-years of follow-up) showed that acyclovir (> or = 3200 mg/day) offered a significant survival benefit (P = .006 by log-rank test) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The treatment effect did not vary significantly in patient subgroups of different CD4 cell counts, hemoglobin levels, age, race, and sex, and with or without AIDS diagnosis. Acyclovir treatment (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.93), higher CD4 cell count (P < .001), higher hemoglobin level (P < .001), and younger age (P < .001) reduced the hazard of mortality. Acyclovir decreased herpes simplex virus infections (odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.21-0.37) and varicella-zoster virus infections (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.63) but not cytomegalovirus disease or mortality from lymphoma or Kaposi's sarcoma. A survival advantage was seen specifically in studies with high incidence of clinical herpesvirus infections (> or = 25% per year). Given the wide confidence intervals, the small effect in low-risk patients, and recent changes in HIV therapeutics, the results should be interpreted cautiously, but the meta-analysis supports the importance of pathogenetic interactions between herpesviruses and HIV."

A total of 329 (22.0%) had antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), a rate nearly four times as high as the 5.8% found recently in a national sample of young male adults, ages 18-26 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of anti-HBc positivity was independently associated with male sex, increasing age, lower level of education, three or more sexual partners in the previous year, and positive syphilis serology. Lack of condom use, history of nonulcerative sexually transmitted diseases, and genital herpes were not associated with anti-HBc positivity. These findings confirm that heterosexual exposure plays an important role in the spread of HBV infection. Furthermore, these data indicate that individuals with more than two sexual partners a year and those with positive syphilis serology should be immunised against HBV."

Emergency adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplantation (adult LDLT) would help address the shortage of available organs for patients with ALF, especially in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-endemic areas. We analyzed a prospective database of 110 consecutive adult patients with ALF. ALF was defined as sudden development of severe coagulopathy and encephalopathy within 26 weeks of onset of symptoms. In about 90% of patients, ALF was caused by etiologies that usually result in poor outcomes, including HBV infection (37%). Three cases (3%) were associated with acetaminophen overdose. Of the 99 patients listed for emergency liver transplantation, four (4%) underwent deceased-donor liver transplantation (DDLT), and 40 (40%) underwent adult LDLT. The 1-year survival rate of adult LDLT patients was 85%. Of the 55 patients listed but not transplanted, 45 (82%) died within a median of 7 days (range, 1-90 days). Multivariate analysis showed that adult LDLT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.10, P < 0.01) and DDLT (HR 0.12, P = 0.04) were associated with decreased mortality, whereas older age (HR 1.03, P = 0.01) and higher Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) (HR 1.03, P = 0.04) was associated with increased mortality of patients.

We examined the influence of coinfection with HBV on prevalence of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C in a multi-centre cohort of HBV-HCV subjects, and by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. We centrally and blindly assessed steatosis prevalence and severity in a cohort of HBV-HCV coinfected subjects compared to HCV and HBV monoinfected controls and we performed a systematic review of studies addressing the prevalence of steatosis in HBV-HCV subjects compared to HCV controls. In the clinical cohort, we included 85 HBV-HCV, 69 HBV and 112 HCV subjects from 16 international centres. There was no significant difference in steatosis prevalence between the HBV-HCV and the HCV groups (33% vs 45%, P = .11). In subgroup analysis, lean HBV-HCV subjects with detectable HBV DNA had less steatosis than lean HCV subjects matched for HCV viremia (15% vs 45%, P = .02). Our literature search identified 5 additional studies included in a systematic review.

2104,0.005,1.0000,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

4320,0.005,1.0000,"Following global efforts to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) access in Sub-Saharan Africa, ART coverage among HIV-infected Cameroonians increased from 0% in 2003 to 22% in 2014. However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (≤40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."
3607,0.005,1.0000,"The reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a long-lived pool of latently infected cells harboring replication-competent viruses, is the major obstacle to curing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can successfully suppress HIV-1 viremia and significantly delay the progression of the disease, it cannot eliminate the viral reservoir and the patient must continue to take anti-viral medicines for life. Currently, the appearance of the 'Berlin patient', the 'Boston patients', and the 'Mississippi baby' have inspired many therapeutic strategies for HIV-1 aimed at curing efforts. However, the specific eradication of viral latency and the recovery and optimization of the HIV-1-specific immune surveillance are major challenges to achieving such a cure. Here, we summarize recent studies addressing the mechanisms underlying the viral latency and define two categories of viral reservoir: 'shallow' and 'deep'. We also present the current strategies and recent advances in the development of a functional cure for HIV-1, focusing on full/partial replacement of the immune system, 'shock and kill', and 'permanent silencing' approaches.

Most of the patients were injecting drug users (71%) and male (88%). All patients were studied for CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, resistance mutations, and viral phenotype. The patients showed a high accumulation of resistance-associated mutations, their CD4(+) cell count and viral load directly correlated with their respective values at initiation of therapy, and the presence of K103N was inversely associated with lower viral load. On the other hand, patients with K103N had the same level of CD4(+) cell count compared with patients without this mutation. Among the patients, a majority with a specific viral phenotype was not present. Rather, a dual-tropic virus was found most frequently, suggesting a preferential suppression of X4-specific strains and less cytopathogenicity during antiretroviral therapy and a greater proportion of R5X4 viruses due to an adaptation to that pressure."

Factors that prevent burnout and employee attrition are seldom studied. Two hundred thirteen staff (doctors, nurses and mental health workers) at a representative sample of Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTC) completed instruments to measure Burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), and perceived job stresses and satisfaction (job tasks, interactions with colleagues and patient care). The staff were surveyed again after two years and their job status determined after 4 years. After 4 years, 35% of the staff had left the field of Hemophilia/HIV care. Univariate tests found that retention was significantly associated with initial job satisfaction, being married and low levels of stress with colleagues. Burnout, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, at baseline, was unrelated to job retention over 4 years. An adjusted multiple logistic regression of all significant variables found that colleague support was most related to retention (OR=2.8, CI=1.49,5.1). We conclude that attrition of highly trained staff is a significant issue for patients and HTCs. These data suggest the important role that a well-functioning team can have in buffering the inevitable stresses associated with HIV care. Mental Health professionals have considerable expertise in addressing these issues."

These patients did not differ statistically by sociodemographics, median age, years since HIV diagnosis, AIDS stage, or median CD4 cell count from the entire 3080 patient cohort. Antiretroviral therapy was received by 352 patients, with 256 given tenofovir (TDF); 325 had undetectable HIV plasma viral load, and 26 were diagnosed with PRTD. In multivariate analysis, significant independent associations were found between PRTD and age (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 per 5-year increase), atazanavir (OR 1.28 per year of exposure), and TDF (OR 1.23 per year) treatment. Among patients having received TDF-containing regimens over a 5-year period, PRTD remained significantly associated with TDF exposure when treatment was ongoing (OR 5.22) or had been discontinued (OR 11.49). Thus, cumulative exposure to TDF and/or atazanavir was associated with an increased risk of PRTD, with concern about its reversibility in patients with HIV."
1136,0.005,1.0000,"Some HIV antiretroviral therapies (ART) have been associated with renal toxicities, which become of increasing concern as HIV-infected patients age and develop comorbidities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative impact of atazanavir (ATV)-based regimens on the renal function of adult patients with HIV. We conducted a systematic literature review by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and the CRD from 2000 until March 2013. Major HIV-related conferences occurring in the past two years were also searched. All randomized clinical trials and large cohort studies assessing renal function in treatment-naïve and/or treatment-experienced HIV patients on ATV-based regimens were included. Fixed-effect mixed-treatment network analyses were carried out on the most frequently reported renal outcomes. 23 studies met the inclusion criteria, and change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline to 48 weeks was identified as the main outcome. Two networks including, respectively, six studies (using the Cockcroft-Gault method) and four studies (using MDRD and CKD-EPI) were analysed. With CG network, ATV/r + TDF/FTC was associated with lower impact on the decline of eGFR than ATV/cobicistat + TDF/FTC but with higher decrease in eGFR than ATV/r + ABC/3TC (difference in mean change from baseline in eGFR respectively +3.67 and -3.89). The use of ATV/cobicistat + TDF/FTC led to a similar decline in eGFR as EVG/cobicistat/TDF/FTC. With respect to third agents combined with TDF/FTC, ATV/r had a lower increase in eGFR in comparison to EFV, and no difference was shown when compared to SQV/r and DRV/r. The effect of ATV-based regimens on renal function at 48 weeks appears similar to other ART regimens and appears to be modest regardless of boosting agent or backbone, although TDF containing backbones consistently leads to greater decline in eGFR."
6390,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major concern. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with entecavir (ETV) plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) against MDR HBV. To adjust for differences in baseline characteristics, inverse probability weighting (IPW) using propensity scores for the entire cohort and weighted Cox proportional hazards models were applied. Ninety-three consecutive patients who were treated with ETV-TDF combination therapy for >6 months were included; at baseline, 45 were infected with HBV strains with genotypic resistance to lamivudine (LAM) and ETV (the LAM/ETV-R group), 28 with strains resistant to LAM and adefovir (ADV) (the LAM/ADV-R group), and 20 with strains resistant to LAM, ETV, and ADV (the LAM/ETV/ADV-R group). The median duration of rescue therapy was 13.0 (range, 6.7 to 31.7) months. Seventy-four of 93 patients (79.6%) achieved complete virologic suppression, after a median of 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 3.0 to 6.0) months. The cumulative probability of complete virologic suppression at month 6 was 63.6% (55.7%, 75.0%, and 65.0% in the LAM/ETV-R, LAM/ADV-R, and LAM/ETV/ADV-R groups, respectively). During the treatment period, these probabilities were not significantly different across the resistance profiles before and after IPW (P = 0.072 and P = 0.510, respectively). In multivariate analysis, a lower baseline HBV DNA level, but not resistance profiles, was an independent predictor of complete virologic suppression. Renal dysfunction was not observed during the treatment period. In conclusion, rescue therapy with ETV-TDF combination is efficient and safe in patients infected with MDR HBV strains regardless of the antiviral drug resistance profiles. "
9062,0.005,1.0000,"This 96-week, randomized, open-label study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of two single-tablet regimens in treatment naïve HIV-1-infected adults: rilpivirine (RPV) + emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) and efavirenz (EFV) + FTC/TDF. Assessments included patient-reported Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory, SF-12v2 Quality of Life assessment, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, and HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire through Week 48. Additional evaluations included study drug discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 786 participants (n=394 RPV/FTC/TDF, n=392 EFV/FTC/TDF) were included. Fewer RPV/FTC/TDF-treated than EFV/FTC/TDF-treated participants discontinued study drug due to TEAEs (2.5% vs. 8.7%), with 41% (14/34) TEAE-related discontinuations in the EFV/FTC/TDF group occurring within the first four weeks of treatment. Treatment adherence and satisfaction remained high through Week 48 and quality of life improved from baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) regardless of adherence (<95% or ≥95%). Significant between-group differences favouring RPV/FTC/TDF were observed for the HIV SIQ symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep (p = .022) and diarrhea or loose bowel movements (p = .002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with RPV/FTC/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with high adherence, high treatment satisfaction, and improved quality of life. TEAE-related discontinuations and patient-reported symptoms indicate that RPV/FTC/TDF may be somewhat better tolerated than EFV/FTC/TDF. "

Despite the good safety profile of the drug, Fanconi syndrome is a possible adverse reaction of TDF treatment, especially in HIV-infected patients. Only a few cases have been reported in patients with CHB-monoinfections. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old man with mild HBeAg-negative CHB who was exposed to TDF and developed drug-induced Fanconi syndrome. Renal dysfunction reverted after TDF discontinuation and a switch to entecavir, and viral replication remained suppressed. A literature review yielded six additional cases of TDF-induced Fanconi syndrome, all with risk factors for renal dysfunction despite the patients having normal glomerular filtration rates. We discuss the overall risk for Fanconi syndrome in CHB-monoinfected patients exposed to TDF and the importance of careful monitoring of glomerular and tubular functions even when pre-existing kidney disease is not present.

No evidence of liver enzyme elevations were seen, even in 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. Given that TDF is an adenosine analogue, like didanosine, exposure to ribavirin might increase intracellular phosphorylated TDF metabolites, which could result in a higher risk of nephrotoxicity. Signs of tubular dysfunction in blood or urine were not recognized in 17 HCV-HIV co-infected patients exposed to TDF during interferon plus ribavirin therapy."

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B in a group of IDU cadavers and to compare the results to a group of cadavers of the normal population. In a case-control study the blood samples of the cadavers of 400 randomly chosen IDUS and 400 other cadavers as control group were checked for HBS antigen and Anti HIV antibody in the forensic medicine center of Tehran. The prevalence of HIV and HBV infection was compared in two groups according to their demographic characteristics. The number of HIV and HBV positive cadavers was significantly higher in the IDU group than the controls (6.25% vs 0.5%, P<0.001, 27.5% vs 3%, P<0.001). The risk of getting infected by HIV virus was 13.27 times greater in the IDU group and the risk of HBV infection was 12.26 times greater in this group as compared to the control group. The age distribution of IDU cadavers indicated that the percentage of IDU cadavers in the reproductive (21-40 years old) age was 80%. The greater prevalence of the HIV and HBV infection especially in the reproductive age of IDUS indicates a greater concern to the authorities for more attention to prevention and harm reduction programs."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."

We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."

Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."

Starting in 1991, it surveyed 100 children with AIDS and 41 HIV-infected children (via adult proxies) six times at quarterly intervals and collected their outpatient bills. These children reported using 5,634 prescriptions and had 5,026 bills. Children with AIDS reported more prescriptions than HIV-infected children. On the basis of CD4 counts and age, 14.2% of children had indications for antiretrovirals, but did not receive them; and 17.7% warranted PCP prophylaxis but did not receive it.

5483,0.005,1.0000,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection is associated with a shift in the target cell population, driven by variability in coreceptor utilization resulting from diversity in env. To elucidate the potential consequences of these changes for Env-mediated fusion over the course of AIDS, we examined the biological properties of serial viral isolates and determined coreceptor utilization by the products of env cloned from two individuals, followed from the detection of seroconversion throughout the course of their infection. One had a typical course, and the other had an accelerated progression. Early isolates were non-syncytium inducing, and the corresponding Env exclusively utilized CCR5, whereas Env from late phases of infection showed restricted utilization of CXCR4 in both patients. Env from subject SC24, who had a standard progression, demonstrated multitropism, manifested by utilization of CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 in the intervening period. In contrast, Env from patient SC51, who experienced early conversion to the syncytium-inducing phenotype, developed dualtropic coreceptor utilization of CCR5 and CXCR4. Genetic analysis of env from each isolate revealed that those with an X4 phenotype formed a distinct subcluster within each subject. Analysis of chimeras constructed from R5 and multispecific env from patient SC24 demonstrated that while the V3 domain played a dominant role in determining coreceptor utilization, sequences in the V4-V5 region also contributed to the latter phenotype. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the hybrid Env proteins were expressed at similar levels. These experiments demonstrate that progression from the R5 to X4 phenotype may occur through a multi- or dual-tropic intermediate and that multiple domains contribute to this process."
1761,0.005,1.0000,"The sera from 16 individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at different clinical stages were evaluated for antibody-dependent neutralization and/or enhancement of infectivity by HIV. The HIV isolate from each individual (homotypic) and established laboratory strains showing broad cellular host range and cytopathicity were used. All sera could neutralize one of the laboratory-passaged isolates, whereas only two could neutralize the corresponding homotypic strain. Seven homotypic isolates were enhanced by serum from the respective individual. This activity was primarily observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, the tropism for macrophages of four of these seven viral isolates was found to be enhanced by the homotypic sera. Finally, sequential pairs of HIV and sera obtained from five HIV-infected individuals with different clinical progression were studied over time. The enhancing activity of three of the five sera appeared to increase over time, indicating changes in both the host virus population and the type of antibodies produced. These results suggest that enhancing antibodies contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of HIV in vivo. They emphasize the necessity of studying further the association of enhancing antibodies and disease progression in infected individuals."

The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-squared test were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Multivariate analysis consisted of a stepwise linear regression analysis. Six hundred and forty-nine HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were included. HCV genotype 1/4 patients who received ATV had higher HCV RNA levels [6.57 (5.9-6.8) log IU/ml] than those who received LPV [6.1 (5.5-6.5) log IU/ml], EFV [6.1 (5.6-6.4) log IU/ml], NVP [5.8 (5.5-5.9) log IU/ml], or other PIs [6.1 (5.7-6.4) log IU/ml] (p=0.014). This association held for the IL28B genotype (CC versus non-CC). The association was not found in patients carrying HCV genotypes 2/3.

Methods. After screening for HCV NS5A resistance-associated variants (RAVs) by PCR invader assay, a total of 54 Japanese patients infected with HCV genotype 1 treated with DCV plus ASV were retrospectively analyzed. SVR12 was used for evaluation of the virologic response. Results. Of the total 54 patients, 46 patients (85.2%) were treated with DCV plus ASV for 24 weeks and achieved SVR12. The other 8 patients (14.8%) discontinued this treatment before 24 weeks due to adverse events. Of these 8 patients, 5 and 3 patients did and did not achieve SVR12, respectively. Finally, 51 of 54 (94.4%) patients achieved SVR12. Conclusion. Treatment with DCV and ASV after screening for HCV NS5A RAVs by PCR invader assay is effective and safe in the treatment of real-world HCV genotype 1-infected patients in Japan. "
2543,0.005,1.0000,"The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa and ribavirin (800 mg daily) (RBV) is the standard of care (SOC) for hepatitis C virus genotype 3-infection leading to a sustained virological response (SVR) in around 65% of patients. A better understanding of the HCV life-cycle has recently resulted in the development of several potential direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins (NS3/4A protease, NS5B nucleos(t)idic and non-nucleos(t)idic polymerase, NS5A viral replication complex). First generation protease inhibitors in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV are not efficient in genotype 3-infected patients. The combination of PEG-IFN/RBV with Daclatasvir, a NS5A inhibitor for 12-24 weeks results in a SVR in around 75% while the triple combination of PEG-IFN/RBV with the oral nucleotidic polymerase inhibitor Sofosbuvir (GS-7977) for 12 weeks in naïve patients results in a SVR in more than 95%. The results of the first oral combination of Sofosbuvir and RBV for 12 weeks in genotype 3-infected patients have been rather disappointing with a slightly lower SVR than after 24 weeks of PEG-IFN: around 60%, and only 30% in patients with cirrhosis. Extending treatment from 12 to 16 weeks in treatment experienced patients doubled the SVR rate and an 80% SVR rate is expected by extending treatment to 24 weeks. The best oral combination of new DAAs is probably the combination of Sofosbuvir and a NS5A inhibitor (Daclatasvir, Ledipasvir…) for 24 weeks, which resulted in a 100% SVR rate in a limited series. The use of cyclophilin inhibitors, a host-targeted antiviral, in association with DAAs and/or RBV may also be of interest. The oral combination of new DAAs (dual or triple combination of different antivirals) or of DAAs and host targets such as cyclophilin will probably become the SOC for genotype 3-infected treatment-naïve or -experienced patients.

Deep kissing was recognised by only 27% of the students as a possible method of transmission while 22% and 13% of the students, respectively, failed to identify the sharing of razor blades and blood transfusions as possible means of contracting HIV infection. The students' knowledge had not greatly affected sexual behaviour. Two-thirds of the respondents had previously had sexual contact; 38% were sexually active at the time of the study, and of these 74% had engaged in unprotected intercourse with casual partners in the previous 6 months. There was a negative attitude towards condom use and over 80% of sexually active students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting AIDS. Campus Health (82%), State health services (51%), and public advertisements (60%) were preferred sources of AIDS information. Newspapers/magazines (80%) and leaflets (69%) were identified as the preferred media. In reality, significantly fewer students obtained their information from Campus Health (15%; P less than 0.05), State health services (19%, P less than 0.05) and leaflets (44%; P less than 0.05).

The present study aimed to examine mutations in this region of the HBV genome and its clinical significance. Briefly, HBV total DNA was extracted from 84 pairs of HCC tumor tissue and corresponding adjacent non‑tumor tissue samples. The RT/S regions (nt130‑1161) were amplified and sequenced using the Sanger method, and associations between RT mutations and the clinical characteristics of patients with HCC were analyzed. Finally, 27 and 29 mutations with frequencies >5% were identified in the RT and S regions, respectively. The rtF221Y variation and a tumor size >8 cm were found to be independent risk factors for the postoperative recurrence of HCC, with hazard ratios of 2.345 (95% CI, 1.391‑3.953; P=0.001) and 1.838 (95% CI, 1.069‑3.161; P=0.028), respectively. rtF221Y was also an independent risk factor for poor overall survival rates (HR=2.557; 95% CI, 1.344‑4.866; P=0.004). The mutation of R122 K in the HBV S protein was closely associated with tumor recurrence (P<0.001).

In the case of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC, molecular discrimination of IM from MO can be achieved by comparison of integrated HBV DNAs. However, Southern blotting cannot be used for this purpose when one tumor is saved in frozen form and the other is in paraffin-embedded form. To solve this problem, we employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to confirm the clonality of primary and recurrent tumors. From the frozen tissue, we determined the junction between the integrated HBV and flanking genomic DNA by molecular cloning, and checked the existence of an identical junction in the DNA of paraffin-embedded tissue by PCR. Using this method, as well as Southern blotting, we proved in 6 of 8 patients that two nodular HCC lesions resected metachronously or simultaneously were caused by MO, while the remaining 2 cases were caused by IM.

HIV-1 induces a condition resembling classical subcortical dementia, known as HAD. The immune mechanisms contributing to HAD have not been elucidated. Cytokine expression in CSF was determined by solid-phase protein array in 33 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive male patients and were compared to levels in non-HIV controls and patients with HAD. Neurological examinations and lumbar and venous punctures were conducted in all patients and controls. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, and IL-10, were up-regulated in all treated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients independent of neurological status compared to controls. In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-1alpha, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were highly expressed in patients with HAD compared to undemented HIV-positive patients. These results show that solid-phase protein array can detect immunological changes in patients infected with HIV. Cytokine expression levels differ in different disease stages and in patients on different treatment paradigms. Pending further validation on a larger number of patients, this method may be a useful tool in CSF diagnostics and the longitudinal evaluation of patient with HAD."
153,0.005,1.0000,"The method of backcalculation was applied to national surveillance data on the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in order to estimate the cumulative number of adults with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection as of January 1, 1985 and July 1, 1987. A ""plausible range"" of estimates was constructed which reflected both uncertainty about the AIDS incubation distribution and random variation from selection and fitting of flexible models of the HIV-1 infection curve. The authors estimated that, as of 1985, 411,000 to 756,000 persons were infected. The infected population included 266,000 to 492,000 homosexual men, 69,000 to 136,000 intravenous drug users, 24,000 to 49,000 homosexual intravenous drug users, and 11,000 to 26,000 persons infected through heterosexual contact. The estimated prevalence of infection among persons aged 15-55 years was 0.31% in whites, 0.78% in Hispanics, and 0.81% in blacks. An estimated 32,000 to 66,000 women were infected. Compared with white women aged 15-55 years, the prevalence of infection was 5.3-fold higher in Hispanic women and 10.2-fold higher in black women. Plausible estimates for the total number infected by July 1987 ranged from 707,000 to 1,376,000, with the most likely estimate equal to 992,000. Backcalculation provides an assessment of the magnitude of the HIV-1 epidemic that is independent of estimates based on prevalence surveys in special populations. The estimates obtained from both methods are consistent and emphasize the need for vigorous programs to prevent the spread of HIV-1, especially in minority communities."
3638,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic active hepatitis B (CAH-B), anti-HBe (+) has been associated with a hepatitis B virus variant carrying a stop codon at the distal pre-C region that prevents HBeAg synthesis. We analyzed the HBV DNA pre-C region in five members of a Turkish family. The mother presented an anti-HBe (+) CAH-B and the four children different hepatitis B virus serological and clinical profiles. The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B. X gene deletions (3 to 20 nt) were also present in some clones from the mother and children A, B and C. No significant difference between serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells concerning the viral population was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9950,0.005,1.0000,"Risk factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are well documented, but the synergisms between these risk factors are not well examined. We conducted a hospital-based, case-control study among 115 HCC patients and 230 non-liver cancer controls. Cases and controls were pathologically diagnosed at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and were matched by 5-year age groups, sex, and year of diagnosis. Information on risk factors was collected by personal interview and medical records review. Blood samples were tested for the presence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus antigen (anti-HCV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (ORs) by the maximum likelihood method. Multivariate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 15.3 (4.3-54.4), 12.6 (2.5-63.1), 4.5 (1.4-14.8), and 4.3 (1.9-9.9) for anti-HCV, HBsAg, heavy alcohol consumption (>/=80 mL ethanol/d), and diabetes mellitus, respectively. Synergistic interactions on the additive model were observed between heavy alcohol consumption and chronic hepatitis virus infection (OR, 53.9; 95% CI, 7.0-415.7) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 9.9; 95% CI, 2.5-39.3). Independent of the effect of HCV, HBV, and diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol consumption contributes to the majority of HCC cases (32%), whereas 22%, 16%, and 20% were explained by HCV, HBV, and diabetes mellitus, respectively. In conclusion, the significant synergy between heavy alcohol consumption, hepatitis virus infection, and diabetes mellitus may suggest a common pathway for hepatocarcinogenesis. Exploring the underlying mechanisms for such synergisms may indicate new HCC prevention strategies in high-risk individuals."
8083,0.005,1.0000,"Tonus was a pilot study in which previously untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients received the combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and tenofovir once a day. There was a high rate of early virological failure, and the M184V and K65R mutations were frequently detected at week 12 (W12). The objective of this study was to examine the selection dynamics of the K65R and M184V/I mutations. Bulk sequencing of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was performed on plasma HIV-1 RNA at baseline, W4, and W12 for 21 patients with detectable viral loads. The RT genes from baseline, W4, and W12 plasma samples from five patients who developed both M184V and K65R but with different mutational patterns were also cloned and screened for the K65R mutation by selective real-time PCR. At baseline, bulk sequencing and clonal analysis showed only wild-type RT sequences. At W4, M184V/I was detected in 12/19 patients and K65K/R in 2 patients by bulk sequencing. At W12, M184V/I was found in 18/20 patient, together with the K65R in 13 patients. At W4, clonal analysis revealed the K65R mutation in 0.6 to 48% of clones in the five patients studied. At W12, the K65R mutation was found in 30 to 100% of clones. K65R and M184V/I seemed to arise in separate clones, followed by an enrichment of viruses containing both mutations. The clinical relevance of this independent evolution is unclear. M184V/I was selected more frequently than K65R at W4. However, K65R was also detected early using a clone-sensitive genotyping method. All three nucleoside analogs are known to select the K65R and/or M184V/I mutation. This convergent genetic pathway to resistance, associated with lower antiretroviral potency, may explain the high selection rate of these mutations in this trial."
8892,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected patients who are on hemodialysis have a worse prognosis than noninfected patients who are on hemodialysis. Their outcome in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era remains unclear. Outcomes in patients who were enrolled in the French Dialysis in HIV/AIDS (DIVA) cohort were determined in a 2-yr prospective follow-up. All HIV-infected patients who were on hemodialysis in France on January 1, 2002, were included and followed prospectively until January 1, 2004. Patients' survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier method, and mortality risk factors were examined using uni- and multicovariate analyses. Survival was compared with that of 584 hemodialysis patients who did not have HIV or diabetes and were enrolled in the French Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) in the same period (after standardization for the average age, gender, and ethnicity of the DIVA cohort). A total of 27,577 patients were receiving hemodialysis in France at the beginning of the study; 164 (0.59%) were infected with HIV, 72% were male, mean age was 44.8 +/- 10.9 yr, and 65% were black. The 2-yr survival rate was 89 +/- 2% and statistically indistinguishable from the survival of the French cohort extracted from the DOPPS II study. Significant mortality risk factors were low CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4/100 CD4 cells per mm(3) lower), high viral load (HR 2.5/1 Log per ml), absence of HAART (HR 2.7), and a history of opportunistic infection (HR 3.7), the last two being independent (HR 2.6 and 3.6, respectively). Survival of HIV-infected patients who are hemodialysis has greatly improved. A prospective cohort of paired hemodialysis patients with and without HIV is required to compare better their mortality in the HAART era."

Several factors were suggested to be associated with seroclearance including age and HBeAg negativity. However, there are few studies evaluating whether HBV DNA levels are an independent predictor of HBsAg seroclearance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the annual HBsAg seroclearance rate and its predictors including serum HBV DNA levels in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients."
8314,0.005,1.0000,"The importance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) level as a surrogate marker for viral load and a predictor of treatment response remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum HBsAg correlates with serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA during peginterferon (PEG-IFN) α-2a treatment (with or without thymosin α-1) in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B patients and whether it can predict treatment response. Sera from 37 HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients receiving 48-weeks PEG-IFN α-2a with (n = 20) or without (n = 17) an initial 12-weeks thymosin α-1 were obtained at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 (end of treatment), 56, 72, 84, and 96 (end of follow-up). Taqman HBV DNA tests (Roche) and Architect HBsAg QT (Abbott) were performed. There was a moderate correlation between the HBsAg and HBV DNA levels (r = 0.452, P < 0.001). Median HBsAg levels at baseline and at week 96 were 6,218 IU/ml and 4,038 IU/ml, respectively. The mean HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 7.48 log(10) IU/ml and 173 IU/L at baseline and 5.37 log(10) IU/ml and 102 IU/L at week 96, respectively. A decrease to <60% of baseline levels of HBsAg at week 12 was identified as an independent predictive factor for HBeAg seroconversion (OR = 45.7, P < 0.05) at week 96. Serum HBsAg levels may be helpful for predicting the response to PEG-IFN therapy in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients."
4591,0.005,1.0000,"The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis D virus (HDV) coinfections as determinants of hepatitis C virus (HCV) suppression in the setting of HIV-HCV coinfection are poorly understood. Our aim was to assess whether HCV viral replication may be affected by HBV or HDV coinfection in the setting of immunodeficiency driven by HIV.Among the 138 enrolled patients 28(20.3%) tested HCV RNA negative and 110 (79.7%) tested HCV RNA negative. The HCV RNA negative patients showed an higher rate of HBsAg positivity compared with those tested HCVRNA positive [12/28 (42.9%) and 5/110 (4.6%), respectively]. Patients with HCV-HBV-HDV coinfection had the highest chance of having an undetectable HCV RNA (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 92.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-1483.5, p<0.0001). Furthermore, HBV coinfection per se was also found to be independently associated with negative HCV viraemia (AOR: 18.5, 95% CI 2.4-143.5, p<0.0001). HBsAg-positive patients with negative HCV viraemia maintained undetectable levels over time. Our results support a direct role of HBV and HDV coinfections in suppressing HCV viraemia in HIV infected patients. This effect is durable over time, and is not influenced by HAART including anti-HBV drugs."
2968,0.005,1.0000,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
589,0.005,1.0000,"After an outbreak of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a unit of pediatric oncology, the clinical outcome and HBV markers were followed in 1 child with chronic and 10 children with acute HBV infection for 12 months. Four children had acute hepatitis with jaundice whereas 7 of the infections were subclinical. Ten children had antecedent malignancies and 1 had aplastic anemia. Four patients died of causes unrelated to the hepatitis after periods of 2, 4, 8 and 10 months. All 3 children who were not immunosuppressed at the time of contracting the HBV infection quickly turned negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), whereas only 2 of 8 patients who were immunosuppressed by chemotherapy eventually became HBsAg-negative. The latter 8 patients were also hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive. Two of them quickly cleared HBeAg, but 6 remained HBeAg-positive throughout the follow-up. In 6 of 9 patients HBsAg was also detected in saliva. These results suggest that children who are receiving anticancer chemotherapy have an increased risk of remaining HBeAg-positive and secreting HBsAg and possibly HBV in their saliva, which makes them particularly infective."

6976,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of intrahepatic delta antigen and/or anti-delta antibody was retrospectively investigated in 102 children with chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis who were seen consecutively in three medical institutions between 1974 and 1982. Delta infection markers were found in 13 patients (12.7%) who exhibited high serum titers of anti-delta antibody; intrahepatic delta antigen was detected in ten. Eleven of the 13 children had severe progressive liver disease associated in all but one with absence of hepatitis B virus replication as evaluated by analysis of serum hepatitis B virus DNA. The factors which seem to increase the risk of delta infection in children who are hepatitis B virus carriers are geographic origin, a history of exposure to blood derivatives and age. A further 37 of 102 children had chronic active hepatitis (20 patients) or cirrhosis (17 patients) without evidence of delta infection. These results indicate that delta infection occurs in children with chronic hepatitis. This possibility should be considered in investigation of children with HBsAg-positive chronic liver disease. Although the delta agent is an important cause of progressive liver disease in children who are chronic HBsAg carriers, severe liver injury and especially cirrhosis can occur without evidence of delta infection."

8905,0.005,1.0000,"The Nef protein of primate immunodeficiency viruses is essential for establishing a highly productive pathogenic infection in vivo. In tissue culture, Nef is not required for infection but enhances viral infectivity. This effect is most pronounced in unstimulated primary lymphocytes and occurs in the early phase of infection prior to viral gene expression. Since Nef expression does not lead to obvious changes in virus composition, it was of interest to analyze whether Nef is incorporated into virus particles. Here, we show that Nef is specifically immunoprecipitated from radioactively labeled human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected cells and virus particle preparations. Quantitative analysis revealed Nef to be incorporated on the order of 10% of reverse transcriptase incorporation, which corresponds to 5 to 10 molecules of Nef per virion. In infected cells, Nef was detected as a full-length 27-kDa protein. In contrast, approximately 50% of particle-associated Nef corresponded to an 18-kDa species which comigrated with the larger product after in vitro cleavage of purified HIV-1 Nef by the viral proteinase. Nef cleavage in particle preparations was completely abolished by a specific inhibitor of HIV-1 proteinase. Most likely, Nef is cleaved concomitantly with viral structural proteins on maturation of virus particles. This cleavage is likely to be functionally significant because it dissociates the conserved core domain from the N-terminal membrane attachment region. Our results suggest that the profound influence of Nef on establishing infection of unstimulated cells in tissue culture and in vivo is mediated by virion-associated Nef which functions in early infection before viral gene expression."
693,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) assays compared with enzyme immunoassay and Western blot and to assess their potential use for routine screening in an emergency department (ED), we analyzed sera from 492 consecutive ED patients using an identity-unlinked design. Sera were analyzed for HIV-1 by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot and two rapid assays: the Abbott Testpack HIV-1 (Abbott Labs, Inc, Abbott Park, IL) and the HIV-1 Genie, (Genetic Systems, Seattle, WA). Seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 492 samples was 5.1%. Both rapid assays were easy to perform and required approximately 10 minutes per test. Sensitivity and specificity of both rapid assays were 100% and 99.8%, with positive and negative predictive values of 96.2% and 100%, respectively. It was concluded that both rapid assays showed high concordance with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Since the ED is often the primary care setting for many patients at risk for HIV-1, the ED may be an optimal site for routine HIV-1 screening. Rapid assay screening may provide the opportunity for timely identification of HIV-1-infected patients, allowing earlier treatment and counseling. However, ethical and practical questions regarding appropriate application of rapid HIV-1 testing in EDs still needs resolution."
5712,0.005,1.0000,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis and the symptoms resolve spontaneously after varying periods of time. After the infection of HIV-1 through the mucosa, the characteristic clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of acute HIV-1 infection appear in each patient through a complicated virus-host interaction. To understand the host responses, we measured two unique proinflammatory cytokines, galectin-9 (Gal-9) and osteopontin (OPN). A β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin, Gal-9, reduces pro-inflammatory type-1 helper T (Th1) cells and Th17 cells and increases anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. The plasma level of Gal-9 is known to be associated with HIV-1 viral load in chronic HIV-1 infection. On the contrary, osteopontin induces Th1/Th17 cells and promotes tissue inflammation. OPN is synthesized by variety of cells in the body, and dendritic cells are known to synthesize OPN in HIV-1 infected individuals. It was hypothesized that Gal-9 and/or OPN could be not only immune-modulators but also novel biomarkers of acute HIV-1 infection. We experienced 3 patients with acute HIV-1 and measured the levels of Gal-9 and OPN periodically before and after antiretroviral treatment. The results showed that the plasma levels of Gal-9 were extremely elevated [more than 2,300 pg/ml (normal range < 46 pg/ml)] in all three acute HIV-1 infected individuals and decreased rapidly after treatment. The changes in the OPN levels were less marked. In conclusion, the plasma levels of Gal-9 may be predictive of a severe inflammation status during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection and could be a potential biomarker during acute infection."
7066,0.005,1.0000,"Viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major health problem for women. Over many years the incidence of these infections has increased steadily to epidemic proportions. These infections not only cause short-term morbidity but also have been associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. This paper focuses on two of the most common viral STDs-Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection of the female. The steady increase in the incidence of HIV infection and subsequent adult immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) among women requires health care providers to assume an active role in detection and treatment in order to avoid transmission, to protect the health of women with HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission. Because treatment with zidovudine has been shown to reduce vertical transmission, routine offering of HIV testing is currently recommended for all pregnant women. The approach to testing nonpregnant patients, i.e., the choice between selective screening or routine testing, rests with the individual clinician. Testing large numbers of patients within a practice may be facilitated by the availability of an oral antibody testing system. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral test is equivalent to blood testing. Serum and oral specimens are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot assays specifically designed for use with oral samples. Controversies in diagnosis as well as the most updated treatments for these infections are discussed."

The study was conducted from the perspective of infected and affected individuals. The authors completed 64 in-depth interviews with heterosexual male and female PLWHAs, as well as with some key individuals from their social network. Following the principles of grounded theory, they carried out inductive analysis to create codes and organize central themes. The authors identified problems related to accessing HAART and found that conditions for implementing recommendations made in the international literature to improve adherence are poor. The findings highlight the importance of social factors, such as health care system irregularities, ineffective physician-patient communication, and availability of family and other sources of social support such as self-help groups for PLWHAs' access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Mexico."

We conducted a cross-sectional study in Western Uganda to examine the factors associated with QOL among patients who had received ART for the duration of at least six months. We interviewed 330 patients attending the HIV/AIDS clinic at two government-supported hospitals in Western Uganda. We measured QOL using a culturally adapted version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-HIV) tool and calculated the physical health summary (PHS) and mental health summary (MHS) scores. In addition, data were collected on sociodemographic factors, three-day self-reported adherence, social support, sexual behavior, CD4 count and viral load. Informational social support was significantly positively correlated with PHS (p=0.001) and MHS (p=0.002). Affectionate support was also significantly positively correlated to PHS (p=0.05) and MHS (p=0.03) but tangible support was not (PHS p value=0.85 and MHS p value=0.31). In the univariate analysis, older age, rural dwelling, alcohol use, CD4 count less than 200, and ART duration of less than one year were significantly associated with lower PHS scores. Lower PHS scores were also associated with sexual inactivity. In multivariate analysis, higher scores on informational social support and CD4> or =200 were associated with higher PHS score and past or recent alcohol consumption was associated with lower scores on MHS. Optimizing ART to restore CD4 count and provision of informational and affectionate social support but not tangible support, to HIV/AIDS patients may improve their QOL."

Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."

These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

2810,0.005,1.0000,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donors at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul and to evaluate the effect of changes in the national blood transfusion policies on the prevalence of these infections. The screening results of 72695 blood donations at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul between January and December 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were screened by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method. Samples found to be positive for anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV were confirmed by Inno-Lia HCV Ab III and Inno-Lia HIV I/II Score, respectively. The seropositivity rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were determined as 1.76%, 0.07%, and 0.008%, respectively. Compared to the previously published data from Red Crescent Centers in Turkey, it was found that HBV and HCV seroprevalances decreased and HIV seroprevalance increased in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that the drop in HBV and HCV prevalence rates are likely multifactorial and may have resulted from more diligent donor questioning upon screening, a higher level of public awareness on viral hepatitis as well as the expansion of HBV vaccination coverage in Turkey. Another factor to contribute to the decreased prevalence of HCV stems from the use of more sensitive confirmation testing on all reactive results, thereby eliminating a fair amount of false positive cases. Despite similar transmission routes, the increase in HIV prevalence in contrast to HBV and HCV may be linked to the increase in AIDS cases in Turkey in recent years."

A pilot study was undertaken to determine acemannan's effect in 49 feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infected cats with clinical signs of disease (Stage 3, 4 or 5), 23 of which had severe lymphopenia. Cats received acemannan either by intravenous (Group 1) or subcutaneous (Group 2) injection once weekly for 12 weeks, or by daily oral (Group 3) administration for 12 weeks. Upon entry into the study, cats were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Laboratory analyses were performed at the beginning of the study and at Weeks 6 and 12. Cats were allowed to continue with a predetermined maintenance regimen of acemannan after completing the 12-week study. Thirteen cats died during the course of treatment. Upon necropsy, the most frequent histopathologic findings were neoplastic, kidney and pancreatic disease. Friedman's two-way ANOVA test showed no significant differences in efficacy among groups administered acemannan by the different routes. Therefore, groups were combined and a signed-ranks test was used to determine changes over time. A significant increase was seen in lymphocyte counts (P < 0.001). Neutrophil counts decreased significantly (P = 0.007), as did incidence of sepsis (P = 0.008). When cats entering with lymphopenia were analyzed separately, a much greater increase in lymphocyte counts was noted (235%) compared with non-lymphopenic cats (42%). A survival rate of 75% was found for all three groups. Thirty-six of 49 animals are alive 5-19 months post-entry. These results suggest that acemannan therapy may be of significant benefit in FIV-infected cats exhibiting clinical signs of disease."

Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART.

MRI was performed in 54 HIV-infected patients with 70 evaluable episodes of fever. Patients receiving antibiotics were excluded. Bactrim was permitted, when given as prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. If abnormalities were found on MRI, sinus aspiration was performed and the aspirate investigated. MRI abnormalities were found in 54.3% of the patients with a significantly higher occurrence of pathological changes in AIDS patients compared with HIV-infected without AIDS. In approximately 2/3 of the aspirates a probable, etiologic agent was found. However, 1/3 of these agents were atypical such as cytomegalovirus and mycobacteriae; in one patient Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found. The high occurrence of sinusitis in HIV-infected patients and the atypical findings in the sinus aspirates stress the importance of searching for sinusitis and the etiology to ensure the correct treatment."

HIV infection stimulates several proinflammatory genes, such as cyclooxigense-2 (COX-2), which leads to an increase in prostaglandin (PG) levels in the plasma of HIV-1-infected patients. These genes play an indeterminate role in HIV replication and pathogenesis. The effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on HIV infection is quite controversial and even contradictory, so we sought to determine the role of PGE2 and the signal transduction pathways involved in HIV infection to elucidate possible new targets for antiretrovirals."

The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission."

There was considerable variability in the percentage of positive swabs from each woman, ranging from 4% to 100% of endocervical swabs and from 0 to 71% of vaginal swabs. In multivariate analyses, plasma HIV-1 RNA was significantly associated with shedding of HIV-1-infected cells; each 1-unit increase in the log of plasma virus load was associated with a 5.6-fold increase in the odds of cervical shedding (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-14.8) and a 3.9-fold increase in the odds of vaginal shedding (95% CI, 2.1-7.2).

7168,0.005,1.0000,"The degree of change in the nucleotide sequence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that occurs when it is transmitted sexually from one individual to another or vertically from mother to child is unknown. Previous studies have shown that most cultured HIV-1 isolates from the same individuals differed in the entire envelope gene nucleotide sequence by up to 2%, although most isolates from unrelated individuals differed by 6-22%. To examine diversity among HIV-1 isolates from close contacts, we determined the nucleotide sequences of viruses from a family with a known epidemiologic profile, in which a woman transmitted HIV-1 heterosexually to her partner and vertically to her daughter. Direct DNA sequence analysis of primary HIV-1 isolates amplified by PCR was used to distinguish the major and minor viral sequences, termed quasispecies, to rapidly determine the predominant sequences and their phylogenetic relationships. The nucleotide sequence diversity of a major portion of the HIV-1 envelope gene was 3.7% between isolates from the woman and her heterosexual partner and 8.5% between isolates from this woman and her daughter, who had been infected for a longer period than the partner. The configuration of the phylogenetic tree demonstrated that the daughter's predominant isolate evolved from a progenitor of her mother's current strain. This study provides evidence of a continuous spectrum of sequence diversity between any two isolates ranging from those derived from the same person to those from close contacts and, ultimately, those from unrelated individuals. These data and methods can be applied to epidemiologic investigations of possible HIV-1 transmission between health care workers and their patients."
1726,0.005,1.0000,"Reactivation of latent JC virus in immunodeficient subjects can lead to a demyelinating disease following lytic oligodendrocyte infection. It is known as idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia and rarely occurs in immunosuppressed patients who are not infected by HIV. We describe a case of persistent idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia in an HIV-negative 65-year-old woman. At autopsy, polymerase chain reaction analysis evidenced JC virus DNA in kidney, brain and liver although there were no signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or evidence of oligodendrocyte infection. While her disease was not HIV-induced, it closely resembled AIDS in terms of the nature of the immune derangement and the clinical picture. The case also evidences the reactivation of JC virus infection in non-HIV-related immunosuppression in cerebral and/or extracerebral sites: liver infection seems to be particularly relevant since it has not yet been recognized as a common target of JC virus infection or a source of virus spreading. The absence of any sign of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was remarkable: histological examination failed to disclose demyelination or other progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy changes, and the search for JC virus DNA with in situ methods also gave negative results. The lack of lytic brain infection in this case would seem to support the hypothesis that the expression of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is directly dependent on the presence of HIV infection."
7786,0.005,1.0000,"To provide additional information on the acquisition of host cell membrane proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced by natural cellular reservoirs, two different field isolates were used to infect ex vivo expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human lymphoid tissue histocultures. The insertion of host-derived HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40, CD40L, and CD86 within HIV-1 particles was evaluated by using specific antibodies linked to a solid matrix to capture ultrafiltrated viral progeny. Overall, our data indicate that neither the HIV-1 co-receptor usage (i.e., T-tropic or macrophage-tropic) nor the cellular source of HIV-1 has an impact on the incorporation process but it was found to be under the influence of the donor source. Given that most viral replication is thought to occur in lymphoid tissues and previous works have shown that HIV-1 life cycle is affected by several virus-anchored host proteins, our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection."

We report a 28-year-old woman who presented with Candida oesophagitis with underlying chronic hepatitis C. The patient presented with anorexia and weakness and was noted to have raised serum transaminases. Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed Candida oesophagitis involving the whole oesophagus. Oesophageal biopsy demonstrated changes consistent with Candida oesophagitis. Serology was positive for hepatitis C antibodies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyped hepatitis C virus (HCV) as genotype 3. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderately active portal inflammation. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was non-reactive for types 1 and 2. The development of Candida oesophagitis in a patient with chronic HCV infection demands prompt consideration of general debility and immunosuppression as effects of HCV that led to an occurrence of opportunistic infection. Evaluation of this case provides insight into various mechanisms of immune suppression associated with HCV infection."
3815,0.005,1.0000,"In a community study in rural Senegal, 22 human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HIV-2) seropositive cases and 64 matched controls were examined clinically and evaluated immunologically. The presence of clinical signs was highly correlated with HIV-2 seropositivity: 9 anti-HIV-2 positive patients and 5 controls presented with clinical signs (odd ratio [OR] = 8.2, confidence limits [CL] 2-35). The main symptom associated with HIV-2 seropositivity was a chronic cough (OR = 18.5, CL 1.8-899). The presence of diarrhoea was not significant (OR = 3.1, CL 0.3-3.5). The total number of CD8 cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, beta 2 microglobulin, and IgG level discriminated between seropositive and seronegative individuals (P less than 0.05). When the anti-HIV-2 positives were grouped as 13 healthy and 9 sick people, red blood cells, lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, CD4 cells, and beta 2 microglobulin differed significantly. Clinical symptoms were associated with immunodepression: 5 of 14 sick people had less than 500 CD4/microliters vs. 1 of 72 healthy persons. This study at the community level emphasizes the clinical and immunological impact of HIV-2 infection. Even if it presents with a longer incubation period than HIV-1, this virus is a major threat to public health."
4099,0.005,1.0000,"Vaginal isolates of Candida albicans from human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) and HIV- women with or without candidal vaginitis were examined for secretory aspartyl proteinase (Sap) production in vitro and in vivo and for the possible correlation of Sap production with pathology and antimycotic susceptibility in vitro. HIV+ women with candidal vaginitis were infected by strains of C. albicans showing significantly higher levels of Sap, a virulence enzyme, than strains isolated from HIV+, C. albicans carrier subjects and HIV- subjects with vaginitis. The greater production of Sap in vitro was paralleled by greater amounts of Sap in the vaginal fluids of infected subjects. In an estrogen-dependent, rat vaginitis model, a strain of C. albicans producing a high level of Sap that was isolated from an HIV+ woman with vaginitis was more pathogenic than a strain of C. albicans that was isolated primarily from an HIV-, Candida carrier. In the same model, pepstatin A, a strong Sap inhibitor, exerted a strong curative effect on experimental vaginitis. No correlation was found between Sap production and antimycotic susceptibility, as most of the isolates were fully susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole, and other antimycotics, regardless of their source (subjects infected with strains producing high or low levels of Sap, subjects with vaginitis or carrier subjects, or subjects with or without HIV). Thus, high Sap production is associated with virulence of C. albicans but not with fungal resistance to fluconazole in HIV-infected subjects, and Sap is a potentially new therapeutic target in candidal vaginitis."

6901,0.005,1.0000,"Limited information exists on the antibody responses elicited against the viral envelope in HIV-1-infected children. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the antibody responses against three different immunogenic regions of HIV-1 envelope, namely V3 region of gp120, membrane proximal external region (MPER), and immunodominant loop (IDL) of gp41 in HIV-1-infected children from north India. We recruited 75 HIV-1-infected (40 antiretroviral naive and 35 treated) children, with age ranging from 1.5 to 16 y. Antibodies to V3 and the IDL region were found in a majority of the infected children, whereas antibodies to MPER were found in approximately one-third of the children studied. Higher antibody titers to the immunogenic regions corresponded to the symptomatic stages of HIV-1 infection in both naive and antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated children. High titers of anti-V3C and anti-IDL antibodies were observed in a subset of antiretroviral-naive patients with suppressed viremia (<47 RNA copies/mL), suggesting that antibodies to these immunogenic regions are present regardless of their viremic status. Further, the antibody titers were significantly lower in the plasma of treated patients compared to naive patients, regardless of whether they were virologically suppressed or not. This is the first report on the antibody responses elicited in HIV-1-infected children in India. The study may help to understand the humoral antibody responses directed against viral envelope in HIV-1-infected children."

All HIV-positive women who attended the HIV outpatients clinic from October 1990 to the end of January 1996 were studied. The main outcome measures were: the number of women undergoing infertility investigations before and after HIV diagnosis, their demographic and social details, and the outcome of these investigations. Most of the 183 women studied were in their reproductive years (mean age 32.7 +/- 6.7 years). Nine women had undergone infertility investigations, and/or treatment before HIV diagnosis, three of whom were diagnosed with HIV during routine testing prior to IVF treatment. Six declined further infertility treatment after discovering their HIV status. Eight women have undergone infertility investigations after HIV diagnosis but none have achieved pregnancy to date. Management decisions may have been hampered by ethical uncertainties in several cases. In conclusion therefore, as requests for infertility treatment from HIV-infected women occur and may become more common as the prevalence of HIV infection in women continues to rise, the ethical issues associated with the management of this problem demand urgent attention so that clear guidelines are available to aid treatment decisions."

However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection.

Their humoral immune response profile, including anti-HIV specific isotypic responses and neutralizing titers, was characterized. Additionally, serum specimens from 12 of these children were tested for their ability to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV envelope antigens. Analysis of our results showed that children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were much more likely to have serum antigenemia and an absence of anti-p24 antibodies than those with AIDS-related complex (ARC). A significant association was also noted between a more stable clinical status and a strong anti-p24 antibody response with detectable antibodies to other HIV antigens in multiple antibody subclasses. This suggests that the longitudinal evaluation of antigen/antibody profiles may aid in the assessment of prognosis for children with HIV infection. Sera from 6/6 patients with ARC and 4/6 patients with AIDS were able to mediate ADCC. No correlation was found between clinical status and the titers of neutralizing antibodies."
1488,0.005,1.0000,"We have used computer-assisted cytokine ELISA spot analysis to measure the frequencies, the type of cytokine, and the amount of cytokine produced by individual recall Ag-specific CD4 memory cells in freshly isolated blood. We studied the memory cells specific for tetanus toxoid and purified protein derivative in 18 healthy individuals and in 22 HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In healthy individuals, the frequency, cytokine signature, and cytokine production per cell of these memory cells were stable over time. Although it is presently unclear whether the maintenance of the memory T cell pool depends upon Ag persistence, cross-reactive Ag stimulation, or cytokine-driven bystander stimulations and expansions, our data strongly argue for a stable memory cell pool in healthy individuals. In HIV patients, however, the frequency of these memory cells was a function of the viral load. The decreased numbers of functional memory cells in patients with high viral loads might provide one mechanism behind the immunodeficient state. Although the cytokine output per cell was unaffected in most patients (20 of 24), in some patients (4 of 24) it was >100-fold reduced, which might provide an additional mechanism to account for the reduced immunocompetence of these patients. The ability to visualize directly and quantify the cytokine produced by the low frequency memory cells in freshly isolated blood that have been physiologically stimulated by Ag should aid comprehensive studies of the Ag-specific memory cell pool in vivo, in health and disease."
4429,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to evade the host cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response through a variety of escape avenues. Epitopes that are presented to CTLs are first processed in the presenting cell in several steps, including proteasomal cleavage, transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, binding by the HLA molecule, and finally presentation to the T-cell receptor. An understanding of the potential of the virus to escape CTL responses can aid in designing an effective vaccine. To investigate such a potential, we analyzed HIV-1 gag from 468 HIV-1-positive Kenyan women by using several bioinformatic approaches that allowed the identification of positively selected amino acids in the HIV-1 gag region and study of the effects that these mutations could have on the various stages of antigen processing. Correlations between positively selected residues and mean CD4 counts also allowed study of the effect of mutation on HIV disease progression. A number of mutations that could create or destroy proteasomal cleavage sites or reduce binding affinity of the transport antigen processing protein, effectively hindering epitope presentation, were identified. Many mutations correlated with the presence of specific HLA alleles and with lower or higher CD4 counts. For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B*5802 (P = 4.73 x 10(-4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019). Thus, V190I is a possible HLA escape mutant. This method classifies many positively selected mutations across the entire gag region according to their potential for immune escape and their effect on disease progression."

The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases.

This report describes findings that suggest HIV was transmitted to two additional patients (patients E and G). These two patients had no other confirmed exposures to HIV, had invasive procedures performed by the dentist, and are infected with HIV strains that are closely related genetically to the strains from the three previously reported patients and from the dentist (Table 1). In addition, this report describes the epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of another HIV-infected patient of the dentist (patient F)."

2448,0.005,1.0000,"Previously, our laboratory showed that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in brain-derived cells with limited HIV-1 gene expression but inhibits HIV-1 in cells fully permissive for replication of both viruses (F. M. Jault, S. A. Spector, and D. H. Spector, J. Virol. 68:959-973, 1994). To investigate these effects further, we developed a model system that uncouples HIV-1 gene expression from long terminal repeat (LTR) activity. Two monoclonal U373-MG astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines (LTRIG and LIGHIVDC) were generated, each containing an integrated copy of an LTR-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct and the Escherichia coli lacI gene. LIGHIVDC also has an inducible HIV-1 genome controlled by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter with lac operator sequences. Basal LTR-mediated CAT activity is 65-fold higher in LIGHIVDC than in LTRIG, and this activity is further increased (20-fold) following incubation of LIGHIVDC with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Tat protein can be detected by immunostaining in LIGHIVDC. However, Rev-mediated transport and subsequent translation of the singly spliced and unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs is inefficient. In the absence of Tat, HCMV stimulated CAT activity approximately 20-fold, and this activation required HCMV gene expression but not viral DNA replication. LTR-directed transcription was unaffected by HCMV infection in LIGHIVDC but was inhibited in these cells when they contained increased Tat levels following IPTG induction. These results support the hypothesis that HCMV can induce the HIV-1 LTR when HIV-1 gene expression is minimal and that a threshold level of HIV-1 gene products is necessary for HCMV to inhibit this promoter."

The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "

The present study evaluated the outcome of salvage antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended by an expert physician based on GRT in a non-clinical trial setting in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. A prospective, open, nonrandomized study evaluating easy access to GRT at six Brazilian AIDS Clinics was carried out. This cooperative study analyzed the efficacy of treatment recommended to patients whose salvage ART was guided by GRT with that of treatment with ART based only on previous ART history. A total of 112 patients with ART failure were included in the study, and 77 of them were submitted to GRT. The median CD4 cell count and viral load for these 77 patients at baseline were (mean +/- SD) 252.1 +/- 157.4 cells/microL and 4.60 +/- 0.5 log10 HIV RNA copies/mL, respectively. The access time, i.e., the time elapsed between ordering the GRT and receiving the result was, on average, 71.9 +/- 37.3 days. The study results demonstrated that access to GRT followed by expert recommendations did not improve the time to persistent treatment failure when compared to conventional salvage ART. Access to GRT in this Brazilian community health care setting did not improve the long-term virologic outcomes of HIV-infected patients experiencing treatment failure. This result is probably related to the long time required to implement ART guided by GRT."

The results of the present study show that 7.2%, 13.0%, and 7.4% of injecting drug users seeking treatment at public drug dependency centres are not tested for, respectively, HIV, HBV and HCV infections and while corresponding figures for drug users who do not inject drugs are 20.3%, 25.1% and 16.2%. The failure to undergo testing among injectors was associated with a shorter history of drug use and with drug centres in central or southern Italy; these associations were also found among non-injectors, with the addition of low level of education. The results stress the importance of facilitating access to testing, of providing the drug dependency centres with the necessary resources for taking blood samples at the centres themselves, of making access to (and performance of) testing uniform throughout the country, and of removing obstacles that can lead to the drug user's refusal to undergo testing."
7701,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is the responsible agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a multi system disorder including the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is an immunological privileged site providing a sanctuary and reservoir for HIV-1. Monocytes derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Although the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a strong reduction of HAD incidence, the prevalence of minor HIV-1 associated cognitive impairment appears rising among AIDS patients. Various factors including toxicity, insurgence of drug resistance and sometimes limited access to HAART, contribute to this phenomenon. Independent evolution of drug resistance mutations in several areas of the CNS may emerge as consequence of incomplete suppression of HIV-1, probably related to poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into CNS. The emergence of resistant virus in the CNS may considerable influence the outcome of neurological disease and also the reseeding of HIV-1 in the systemic circulation upon failure of therapy. In this review, we outline the current state of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of CNS injury in HIV-1 infection and will focus on the effects of HAART on CNS."
5555,0.005,1.0000,"One hundred and seventy five subjects with chronic liver diseases which included patients with chronic active hepatitis (90), liver cirrhosis (31) and asymptomatic hepatitis B carriers (54), were included in the study. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific DNA-polymerase activity and HBe-markers were tested as markers of HBV-multiplication. In HBsAg positive samples, DNA-P activity was positive in 44.4% of the HBV carriers, 52.9% of the patients with chronic active hepatitis and 81.8% of the patients with liver cirrhosis. The corresponding figures for the presence of HBeAg in these groups were 18.5, 26.5 and 45.5% respectively. Virus multiplication was also observed in 41.1 and 44.4% patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis respectively, in the absence of HBsAg. The results of the present study show that hepatitis B virus is the most important etiological factor of chronic liver diseases in India. Most of our patients of chronic liver diseases seems to have contacted HBV infection as young adults and the mode of transmission is likely to be horizontal rather than vertical. The virus replicating markers correlate well with the severity of the liver injury and decreased with the age. DNA-P activity is a more sensitive marker of viral multiplication than HBeAg. Viral multiplication was also found to occur in the absence of the usual HBV markers. Continued viral multiplication in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis is implicated in continued liver injury and progressive liver disease."

Substance abuse is an important comorbidity that affects the delivery and outcomes of HIV medical management. In this paper I will review data examining the associations between substance abuse and HIV treatment and potential strategies to improve outcomes in this population that warrant further investigation. Current - but not past - substance abuse adversely affects engagement in care, acceptance of antiretroviral therapy, adherence with therapy, and long-term persistence in care. Substance abuse treatment appears to facilitate engagement in HIV care, and access to evidence-based treatment for substance abuse is central to addressing the HIV epidemic. Strategies that show promise for HIV-infected substance abusers include integrated treatment models, directly observed therapy, and incentive-based interventions."
3629,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies have shown the importance of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in achieving HIV-1 suppression. However, most have focused on naïve patients and do not assess the impact of HAART on viral load (VL). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adherence program in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent patients. We performed a cohort study of all adult HIV-1 infected patients with detectable VL who were treatment experienced and poorly adherent to HAART, included in an adherence program since its introduction in 2009 (n=136). The adherence program consisted of a multidisciplinary team with a nurse who specialized in behavioral intervention, counselling on substance abuse, and motivational interviewing, as well as a social worker responsible for referring patients to local healthcare centers. Effectiveness was evaluated as percentage of patients with VL <50 copies/mL at week 48 by modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Initially, 76.6% of the patients had an adherence <30% according to the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). At 48 weeks, 48.1% of the patients had VL <50 copies/mL, and the adherence was >90% in 71% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, a ratio of bottle refill per month >0.9 during the study [odds ratio (OR) 14.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.08-50.08, p<0.001] and being on a b.i.d. regimen (OR 12.5; 95% CI 1.81-86.4, p=0.010) were associated with an undetectable VL. In conclusion, the adherence program was successful in almost half of the patients, despite their long treatment experience and prior poor adherence. This strategy may help to prevent disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission in these patients."

On initial evaluation, 3 (0.3%) had HIV-1 antibody, 170 (17.6%) had HTLV-I antibody, 578 (59.8%) had anti-HBc, and 7 (0.7%) had antibody to hepatitis C virus. The mean annual incidence of HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection was 1.6% and 4.7%, respectively. Univariate and logistic regression analysis of prevalence data indicated an association between sexual activity and HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection, but no independent risk factors were identified in cohort analysis. Parenteral risk factors were not associated with transmission, except for a small percentage of subjects who may have acquired hepatitis B infection from blood transfusions. These findings suggest that there is a high incidence of HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection from heterosexual contact in this female prostitute population."

1190,0.005,1.0000,"Physical activity (PA) can improve cardiorespiratory status, strength, body composition and quality of life for patients infected with HIV. Evidence from HIV-uninfected populations also shows that PA is associated with a lower risk of mortality, primarily death due to cardiovascular causes. There is, however, a lack of data on how physically active HIV-infected patients are. In this study, we assessed levels of self-reported PA over time in patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, a large multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We included a total of 10,540 patients who completed at least one report of PA between December 2009 and November 2014 during routine clinical follow-up (scheduled every 6 months). In the first year after December 2009 there was a higher rate of non-response so these data are of a lesser reliability. Over the next four years, the percentage of patients reporting no free-time PA at all declined from 49% to 44%. In contrast, in two ""Sport Switzerland"" surveys of the general population in 2008 and 2014, the percentage of individuals reporting no sports activities at all was considerably lower and relatively stable over time (27% in 2008; 26% in 2014). In our analysis, the percentage of patients reporting sedentary activity at work increased from 23% to 26% over the four years. Subgroup findings suggest differences between women and men and between patients classified by their age, stage of infection and CD4 cell count. Integrating PA counselling into the routine care of HIV-infected patients and promoting PA among this population has the potential to improve the general state of health and quality of life for HIV-infected patients and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease."
7723,0.005,1.0000,"Data collected in a routine clinical setting are frequently used to compare antiretroviral treatments for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Differences in the frequency of measurement of HIV RNA levels and CD4-positive T-lymphocyte cell counts introduce a possible source of bias into estimates of the difference in effectiveness between treatments. The authors investigated the size of this bias when survival analysis methods are used to compare the initial efficacy of antiretroviral regimens. Data sets of clinical markers were simulated by use of differential equations that model the interaction between HIV and human T-cells. Cox proportional hazards and parametric models were fitted to the simulated data sets to evaluate the bias and coverage of 95% confidence intervals for the difference between regimens. The authors' results demonstrate that differences in the frequency of follow-up can substantially bias estimated treatment differences if methods do not correctly account for the intervals between measurements and if the statistical model chosen does not fit the data well. Analyses using methods applicable to interval-censored data reduce the bias. In the Athena cohort of HIV-infected individuals in the Netherlands from 1999 to 2003, there are differences in measurement frequency between current regimens that are of sufficient magnitude to conclude incorrectly that some regimens are more effective than others."
5102,0.005,1.0000,"The absence of expanded numbers of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-reactive CD8(+) T lymphocytes (CTLs) in patients chronically infected with HCV has led to the investigation of dendritic cell (DC) function in this population as a potential cause for this defect. Several studies have shown evidence for impaired monocyte-derived DCs in chronically infected patients. As it is difficult to reconcile these data with the fact that patients with chronic HCV are immune competent, we re-evaluated this finding, carefully assessing phenotypic markers and functional activity of patient DCs as compared with noninfected controls. In contrast to these prior studies, DCs from 13 of 13 chronic HCV patients expressed typical maturation markers. These mature DCs were capable of priming allogeneic T lymphocytes, as well as stimulating influenza-specific memory T cells. This finding is consistent with clinical and immunologic data that the deficit in the patient's immune repertoire is HCV-specific and suggests that refined models are required for understanding the role of DCs in HCV pathogenesis."
8364,0.005,1.0000,"Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections usually lead to death from AIDS, although the rate of the disease progression varies widely among individuals. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is restricted by highly polymorphic MHC class I alleles, plays a central role in controlling HIV replication. It is now recognized that the antiviral efficacy of CTLs at the single cell level is dependent on their antigen specificity and is important in determining the quality of host response to viruses so that the individual will remain asymptomatic. However, because of the extreme mutational plasticity of HIV, HIV-specific CTL responses are continuously and dynamically changing. In order to rationally design an effective vaccine, the questions as to what constitutes an effective antiviral CTL response and what characterizes a potent antigenic peptide to induce such responses are becoming highlighted as needing to be answered."
8236,0.005,1.0000,"The Asia-Pacific region has disparate hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology, with prevalence ranging from 0·1% to 4·7%, and a unique genotype distribution. Genotype 1b dominates in east Asia, whereas in south Asia and southeast Asia genotype 3 dominates, and in Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), genotype 6 is most common. Often, availability of all-oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is delayed because of differing regulatory requirements. Ideally, for genotype 1 infections, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, or ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir plus dasabuvir are suitable. Asunaprevir plus daclatasvir is appropriate for compensated genotype 1b HCV if baseline NS5A mutations are absent. For genotype 3 infections, sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and ribavirin for 12 weeks are the optimal oral therapies, particularly for patients with cirrhosis and those who are treatment experienced, whereas sofosbuvir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin for 12 weeks is an alternative regimen. For genotype 6, sofosbuvir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin, sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, or sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks are all suitable. Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin has been replaced by sofosbuvir plus pegylated interferon and ribavirin, and all-oral therapies where available, but cost and affordability remain a major issue because of the absence of universal health coverage. Few patients have been treated because of multiple barriers to accessing care. HCV in the Asia-Pacific region is challenging because of the disparate epidemiology, poor access to all-oral therapy because of availability, cost, or regulatory licensing. Until these problems are addressed, the burden of disease is likely to remain high."

As with other parts of the world, the HIV epidemic in Asia impacts mainly on men who have sex with men, one of the at-risk populations for sexually transmitted viral hepatitis. With the increasing availability of effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-related mortality of people living with HIV has markedly reduced. Liver disease has become an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the HIV-infected population. With the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and availability of healthcare in Asian countries in recent years, the epidemiology of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men has also evolved. This review updates the epidemiology of different types of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis in this defined population in Asia. "
2644,0.005,1.0000,"Control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by HLA-B27-positive subjects has been linked to an immunodominant CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting the conserved KK10 epitope (KRWIILGLNK(263-272)) in p24/Gag. Viral escape in KK10 typically occurs through development of an R(264)K substitution in conjunction with the upstream compensatory mutation S(173)A, and the difficulty of the virus to escape from the immune response against the KK10 epitope until late in infection has been associated with slower clinical progression. Rare alternative escape mutations at R(264) have been observed, but factors dictating the preferential selection of R(264)K remain unclear. Here we illustrate that while all observed R(264) mutations (K, G, Q, and T) reduced peptide binding to HLA-B27 and impaired viral replication, the replicative defects of the alternative mutants were actually less pronounced than those for R(264)K. Importantly, however, none of these mutants replicated as well as an R(264)K variant containing the compensatory mutation S(173)A. In assessing the combined effects of viral replication and CTL escape using an in vitro coculture assay, we further observed that the compensated R(264)K mutant also displayed the highest replication capacity in the presence of KK10-specific CTLs. Comparisons of codon usage for the respective variants indicated that generation of the R(264)K mutation may also be favored due to a G-to-A bias in nucleotide substitutions during HIV-1 replication. Together, these data suggest that the preference for R(264)K is due primarily to the ability of the S(173)A-compensated virus to replicate better than alternative variants in the presence of CTLs, suggesting that viral fitness is a key contributor for the selection of immune escape variants."

Therefore, for the first time, the present study was carried out to investigate the molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and population dynamics of HBV based on 146 HBV-infected patients. A 435-bp portion of the HBV S region was sequenced, and the phylogeny was reconstructed, indicating that three genotypes, B, C and D of HBV were distributed in Dianjiang County. The predominant genotype is B (67.12 %), followed by C (32.19 %) and D (0.68 %). Patient demographic information and clinical outcomes were examined by genotypes, and no significant association was found. Population dynamics analysis suggested that both genotype B and C have experienced a tenfold expansion during the last five years for reasons that are unclear.

It was found that 71.7% were subtype CRF_01AE, 9.3% were subtype B, while 11.7 and 7.3% of them were cross-reactive and non-typeable, respectively. Moreover the results from peptide ELISA also showed that a low CD4 cell count was related to a low anti-Tat antibody (p < 0.05), which may be due to the progression of HIV-1, which can be found predominantly in AIDS patients. The results of nested PCR showed that the second Tat exon might also play a role in T-cell activation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure HIV-1 mRNA expression in PBMC. RT-PCR negative results were found mostly in the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive group (88%). HIV-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with current immunologic status. The differences in Tat protein sequences from DNA sequencing between the patients who had anti-Tat antibody positive and anti-Tat antibody negative, were not significant (p > 0.05). These results suggested that the Tat amino acid sequences were conserved among each group of samples and did not change significantly compared with the consensus sequence in previous studies. Several factors make Tat an attractive target for vaccine design."
9617,0.005,1.0000,"Unintegrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA are viral DNA products formed naturally during HIV replication. While the integrated proviral DNA form is transcriptionally active and results in productive infection, unintegrated DNA is also capable of expression of viral RNA and proteins. Previously, we showed that HIV Vpr enhances expression from integrase-defective HIV. Here we show that Vpr activation of expression is partially dependent upon the presence of a transcriptionally active HIV promoter and results in increased transcription of unspliced gag and spliced nef viral RNA. While Tat is detectable during infection with integrase-defective HIV, Tat levels are not affected by the presence of Vpr. Mutation studies reveal that Tat is dispensable for the Vpr-mediated enhancement of expression from unintegrated DNA. We find that virion-associated Vpr is sufficient for Nef expression from unintegrated viral DNA, resulting in the efficient downregulation of CD4 from the surface of infected cells. These results provide a mechanism by which Nef expression from unintegrated HIV type 1 DNA expression occurs."
2110,0.005,1.0000,"The severe depletion of CD4+ T cells is the most obvious and dramatic immunologic event that occurs in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 during development to AIDS. Nevertheless, a complex and sequential pattern of loss of T-helper cell (TH) function can occur years before development of AIDS symptoms. Such suppression could be due to immunosuppressive factors that are either products of HIV, such as gp120 and tat, or HIV-induced immunoregulatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10. Recent data suggest that multiple and independent immunosuppressive factors, including gp120-induced suppression and IL-10, are responsible for the loss of TH function seen in HIV-infected individuals before development of symptoms. The same TH functional abnormalities observed in adult patients are also seen in pediatric cases. Pediatric cases of HIV infection present some unique problems, however, in that one needs to be able to distinguish between HIV-induced suppression of TH function and the absence of TH function that is due to lack of maturation or immunologic priming."
2151,0.005,1.0000,"Five regions of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) have been shown to be important in the transcriptional regulation of HIV in HeLa cells. These include the negative regulatory, enhancer, SP1, TATA, and TAR regions. Previous studies in which purified SP1 was used showed that the three SP1-binding sites in the HIV LTR were important in the in vitro transcription of this promoter. However, no studies to ascertain the role of each of these SP1-binding sites in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation in vivo have been reported. To determine the role of SP1 sites in transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR in vivo, these sites were subjected to oligonucleotide mutagenesis both individually and in groups. The constructs were tested by DNase I footprinting with both oligonucleotide affinity column-purified SP1 and partially purified HeLa extract and by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays in both the presence and absence of the tat gene. Mutagenesis of each SP1-binding site resulted in minimal changes in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. Mutations involving alterations of SP1 sites I and II, I and III, or II and III also resulted in minimal decreases in basal and tat-induced transcriptional activation. However, mutagenesis of all three SP1-binding sites resulted in a marked decrease in tat induction. The latter mutation also greatly decreased DNase I protection over the enhancer, TATA, and TAR regions when partially purified HeLa nuclear extract was used. Mutagenesis of the HIV LTR SP1 sites which converted them to consensus high-affinity SP1-binding sites with the sequence GGGGCGGGGC resulted in increased tat-induced gene expression compared with the wild-type HIV LTR template. These results suggest that SP1, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins, is critical for in vivo transcriptional regulation of HIV."
6037,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often causes latent infection. Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The transactivator (IE-2) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro. This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes. While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components. Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation, with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation. A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators. Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element."

Patients were treated with 100% oxygen at two atmospheres of absolute pressure three times per week for two months, then two times per week on an ongoing basis. Laboratory markers were assessed monthly. All patients experienced relief of debilitating fatigue within one month of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It was concluded that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective adjunctive treatment in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Laboratory markers, clinical significance, nursing implications, and cost-effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy are discussed."
5011,0.005,1.0000,"This paper presents recommendations on the care of HIV infected adults based upon the authors' personal experience with close to 700 patients in a multiprofessional pilot center. This medical care has 5 main objectives: 1) Promotion of good health (through standard recommendation of hygiene, health habits and regular checkups); 2) prevention of infectious complications (through detection of latent pathogens, chemoprophylaxis, vaccination and avoidance of risky exposures); 3) Treatment of complications (mainly infectious, through early diagnosis and proper treatment); 4) Delay of HIV disease progression (through timely and properly chosen antiretroviral therapy); 5) Reduction of HIV infection spread from index case to others (through promotion of responsible behavior and avoidance of pregnancy and HIV exposure to others). Studies for evaluating global health and immunologic status and carriage of potential pathogens are discussed as well as the criteria and timing for chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis and P carinii pneumonia (PCP). Algorithms for the management of major clinical syndromes are presented: Diarrhea (afebrile, mostly parasitic, versus febrile, frequently bacterial); Pneumonia (lobar mostly bacterial versus interstitial, frequently PCP especially if lymphopenic and not receiving PCP prophylaxis); Brain mass lesion (most commonly toxoplasmosis). Finally, the evaluation and diagnostic possibilities of febrile patients is presented, based upon the immunologic status and associated symptoms."
7929,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is relatively common. However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."
7710,0.005,1.0000,"Co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV) is very common in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected patients. Although HIV co-infection clearly accelerates progression of HCV-related fibrosis and liver disease, controversy remains as to the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression in co-infected patients. HIV can cause immune dysfunction, in which the regulatory function of T helper (Th) cells is very essential. Moreover, cytokines derived from Th cells play a prominent role in viral infection. Investigating the functional changes of Th1 and Th2 cells in cytokine level can improve the understanding of the effect of co-infected HCV on HIV infection."
5811,0.005,1.0000,"HIV accelerates progression of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease. There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

4564,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
4018,0.005,1.0000,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
462,0.005,1.0000,"A direct causal association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the development of nephropathy remains controversial. Epidemiological studies have shown that chronic carriage of HBV in some individuals (particularly children) leads to the development of nephrotic syndrome with a strong male predominance, the commonest histological type being membranous nephropathy (MN). Spontaneous clearance of HBV antigens (particularly the HBeAg) leads to abrogation of proteinuria. The isolation of immune complexes in the kidney suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease may have an immune-complex basis. Recent studies showing expression of HBV viral antigens in kidney tissue suggest direct viral-induced pathological alterations and chronic immunologic injury. Biosocial studies have detected no correlation between HBV carriage and proteinuria using both quantitative and qualitative urinary protein analysis. Genetic studies of HLA class I and II genes showed a predisposition to MN but no similar correlation in those with milder degrees of proteinuria. These findings suggest that milder proteinuria is unrelated to HBV carriage or genetic factors but the development of nephropathy, particularly MN, in patients with chronic HBV carriage (HBsAg and/or HBV DNA positive) is based on an interaction of virus and host factors. Although the natural history of the disease tends to remission with preservation of renal function, there is considerable morbidity and a small but significant mortality. Use of naturally occurring cytokines (such as interferon-alpha2b) and other candidate therapies accelerates clearance of the virus and proteinuria. The most effective tool in reducing the incidence of the disease is the use of HBV vaccines."

Low CD4+ cell counts may result in false-negative results on all diagnostic tests except hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA assays, which are the gold standard for viral replication. First-line management of HIV-HCV--coinfected patients should be optimization of HAART, because low CD4+ cell counts have been associated with greater fibrosis. In addition, agents used to treat hepatitis C may lower CD4+ cell counts and hemoglobin levels. Long-acting interferons offer the promise of better sustained HCV response in HIV-HCV coinfection."
119,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

Of these 62, 12 (19.4%) were positive. There were 28 men whose serostatus was not recorded. Data on the HIV risk behaviors of these 28 men suggested that seroprevalence could have been similarly high among them.

9923,0.005,1.0000,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
7248,0.005,1.0000,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
8798,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) share routes of transmission. There is limited data on the incidence of active co-infection with HBV and/or HCV in cancer patients infected with HIV in Africa. This was a prospective study based on 34 patients with varied cancer diagnosis, infected with HIV and awaiting cancer therapy in South Africa. HIV viral load, CD4+ cell counts, Alanine-aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were tested. Exposure to HBV and HCV was assessed serologically using commercial kits. Active HBV and/or HCV co-infection was detected using viral specific nested PCR assays. HCV 5'-UTR PCR products were sequenced to confirm active HCV infection. Active viral infection was detected in 64.7% of patients for HBV, 38.2% for HCV, and 29.4% for both HBV and HCV. Occult HBV infection was observed in 63.6% of the patients, while seronegative HCV infection was found in 30.8% of patients. In addition, CD4+ cell count < 350 cells/µl was not a risk factor for increased active HBV, HCV or both HBV and HCV co-infections. A total of 72.7%, 18.2% and 9.1% of the HCV sequences were assigned genotype 5, 1 and 4 respectively.The study revealed for the first time a high active HBV and/or HCV co-infection rate in cancer patients infected with HIV. The findings call for HBV and HCV testing in such patients, and where feasible, appropriate antiviral treatment be indicated, as chemotherapy or radiotherapy has been associated with reactivation of viral hepatitis and termination of cancer therapy."
4762,0.005,1.0000,"Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. African Americans (AAs) have the highest incidence of CRC of any American ethnic group. Survival from CRC in AAs is lower than in Caucasians, and the mean age of CRC development in AAs is younger. The AA community also has a high rate of HIV infection, accounting for 50.3% of all cases despite making up only 13.6% of the population. This retrospective cohort study identified 17 AA HIV patients with CRC. The patients were matched with 42 HIV-negative CRC patients (controls), based on age, sex, and TNM stage. Data were obtained from 3 hospitals in New Jersey: St. Michael's Medical Center, Trinitas Medical Center and St. Joseph's Medical Center. The age, sex, HIV status, tumor site, stage, drug usage, Hepatitis C status, and survival outcome of subjects and controls were compared. Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) specific to AAs were also compared. The mean age of CRC diagnosis was younger, 50.7 years (median: 52 years, range: 35-71 years), versus 59.42 years (median: 66 years) (P < 0.0001) in the SEER AA population. Of the patients, 29.4% were diagnosed with CRC at less than 45 years of age, versus only 6.35% of the SEER AA population (P < 0.0002). The male-to-female ratio was 11:6. Seven individuals used IV drugs, and 7 had hepatitis C. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 510.81 cells/mm(3) (median 419). At the time of CRC diagnosis, the average duration of HIV infection was 7.6 years (range 0-22.4 years).Of patients, 87.5% had left-sided CRC, versus 57.55% of the SEER population (P < 0.024). Of the patients, 52.94% had stage III-IV, at diagnosis, versus 43.84% in SEER. There was no statistically significant survival difference between the cases and controls. In our cohort of HIV-infected AA's with CRC, the staging and outcome of CRC did not appear to be affected by the degree of immunosuppression. HIV-infected AA with CRC presented with a higher percentage of left-sided CRC than AA's without HIV. Additionally, AAs with HIV tended to be younger at the time of CRC diagnosis. Our findings suggest that screening for CRC should be offered to HIV-infected AAs before the age of 45, and that sigmoidoscopy with fecal occult blood testing might be an acceptable screening modality. However, the exact age of initiation, optimal frequency, and preferred method of screening (colonoscopy vs. sigmoidoscopy) in this population requires further study."
9908,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients are vulnerable to becoming lost-to-care (LTC) because they are not monitored as often as patients on treatment. We examined data from 19,461 HIV positive adults at 10 HIV clinics in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Cameroon, and Burundi participating in the Phase 1 International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Central Africa (IeDEA-CA) study. Patients were LTC if they were ART-naïve and did not return within 7 months of the end of data collection. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors associated with LTC. Of 5353 ART-naïve patients, 4420 (83%) were LTC and 933 (17%) were in-care. The odds of being LTC were greatest among patients from DRC (OR = 2.16, CI: 1.64-2.84, p < .0001), males (OR = 1.39, CI: 1.15-1.69, p = .0009), and ages 18-49 (OR = 1.45, CI: 1.16-1.82, p = .001). The odds of being LTC were least among patients with a WHO Clinical Stage of 1 or 2 (OR = 0.65, CI: 0.55-0.77, p < .0001) and in a perceived concordant relationship (OR = 0.61, CI: 0.43-0.87, p < .0001). LTC patients were more likely to have characteristics associated with higher risk for HIV transmission and progression. Many entered care at advanced stages and were less likely to know their partner's serostatus. Greater efforts to retain ART-naïve patients may increase earlier initiation of ART."

Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."
158,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) became more widely available in the Russian Federation in 2006 when the Global Fund made a contribution to purchase ART with a mandate to increase numbers of patients receiving it. Funds were distributed to AIDS Centers and selected hospitals, and numbers quickly increased. Though ART is highly effective for adherent patients, dropout has been a problem; thus understanding characteristics of patients who remain on ART vs. those who leave treatment may provide information to facilitate engagement. We retrospectively assessed depression, hopelessness, substance use, viral load, and CD4+ counts of 120 patients who dropped out of ART for ≥12 months (Lost-to-Care, LTCs) and 120 who continued for ≥12 months (Engaged-in-Care, EICs). As expected, LTCs had higher viral loads and depression, lower CD4+ counts, more alcohol, heroin, and injection drug use in the past 30 days. A binary logistic regression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score, Beck Hopelessness score, whether drugs/alcohol had ever prevented them from taking ART, and past 30 days' alcohol use [χ(2)(4) = 64.27, p = .0.000] correctly classified 74.5% of participants as LTC or EIC, suggesting that integrated treatment for substance use, psychiatric, and HIV could reduce dropout and improve outcomes."
1314,0.005,1.0000,"Patient self-reported outcomes are increasingly important in measuring disease, treatment and care outcomes. It is unclear what constitutes well-being using a combined biomedical and psychosocial approach for patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART) access. This study aimed to determine the variance within the visual analogue scale (VAS) measure of health status using the existing five dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, to identify which domains have the greatest effect on self-reported health status and to identify associations with the VAS using both biomedical and psychosocial factors among HIV outpatients. Consecutive patients in five UK clinics were recruited to a cross-sectional survey, n=778 (86% response rate). Patients self-completed validated measures, with treatment variables extracted from file. On the EuroQOL-5D, nearly one-third (28.1%) had mobility problems, one-fifth (18.7%) self-care problems, one-third (37.4%) difficulty in performing usual tasks and one-half (44.4%) reported pain/discomfort. In the regression model to determine associations with self-reported health status (VAS score), neither CD4 count nor ART status was associated with the outcome. However, in addition to four dimensions of the EuroQOL-5D, poorer health status was associated with worse physical symptom burden, treatment optimism and psychological symptoms. There is a relatively high prevalence of psychological morbidity and poor physical function, and these burdens of disease are associated with worse self-reported health status. As HIV management focuses on treatment for extended survival and a chronic model of disease, clinical attention to physical and psychological dimensions of patient care are essential to achieve optimal well-being."

8382,0.005,1.0000,"This study describes and conceptualizes the experiences of stigma in a group of children living with HIV in São Paulo, Brazil, and evaluates the impact of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) over the social course of AIDS and over the children's experiences of stigma. Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."

The aim of this study was to determine the HBV infection rate in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients with or without seroconversion and to compare these groups in respect to HBV infection rate. The study group included 111 male and 85 female ALL patients with a mean age of 6.23+/-4.10 years. Patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group 1 included 82 patients who were vaccinated during maintenance chemotherapy, Group 2 included 87 unvaccinated patients, and Group 3 included 27 patients who were vaccinated prior to the diagnosis of ALL. Seroconversion was obtained in 35.4% (29/82) of patients in Group 1. The incidence of HBV infection was significantly lower in Group 1 (4/82, 4.8%) than in Group 2 (25/87, 28.7%). When we compared only the seronegative patients in Group 1 with Group 2 in respect to HBV infection rate, Group 1 still had a significantly lower HBV infection rate than Group 2 (7.5% versus 28.7%) (p<0.001). No patients in Group 3 (n=27) had HBV infection. In addition to the seroconversion level, infection rate is also important in the evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination. Our study results suggest that a high protective role of HBV vaccination was also observed in non-seroconversion ALL patients. The effect of cellular immunity on the protection against infection should also be investigated in such patients with further studies."

In the HCV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 9%, 18%, and 23% in the first, second, and third years, respectively. In the HCV + AL group, that was 13%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. There was no difference in the HCC occurrence rate between the two groups. In the AL group, the cumulative HCC occurrence rate was only 1% during the observation period of 3 years. The occurrence rate was significantly lower in the AL group, compared with the HCV and the HCV + AL groups. In the HBV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of HCC during the observation period of 3 years was 17%, which was similar to that of the HBV + AL group, 14%. We also examined some other variables that might be related to the development of HCC. The cumulative occurrence rate of HCC in male patients was 31%, whereas that was 18% in female patients. In the HCV group, there was a significant increase of HCC occurrence rate in male patients. In contrast, no difference was observed in the HCC occurrence rate between male and female patients in the HBV group. The present study suggests that alcohol alone may not be an independent risk factor for HCC, nor does it accelerate HCC development in LC patients with HCV and HBV infection during the prospective observation of 3 years."

The exposure rate (HBsAg + anti-HBs) was high in both controls and patients, 72.5% and 70.9% respectively, The frequency of HBsAg was significantly higher in patients with lepromatous leprosy (40%) compared with controls (10%) (chi 2 = 5.7 p less than 0.025) but there was no difference in the prevalence rate of HBsAg between patients with lepromatous leprosy (40%) compared with those with tuberculoid leprosy (23.8%) (chi 2 = 1.7 p greater than 0.1). The exposure rate was higher in the lepromatous group (80%) compared with the tuberculoid group (59.5%) but the difference was not significant (chi 2 = 2.87 p greater than 0.05). It is concluded that the high rate of infection in patients with leprosy if not due to a peculiar genetic defect but the result of living in an environment where the virus is highly endemic. The observed significance increase in carriage of HBsAg in lepromatous leprosy is probably due to depressed cellular immune function characteristic of this group of patients. The slightly increased exposure rate to HBV of lepromatous versus the tuberculoid type of leprosy is probably due to increased opportunity for infections from repeated and prolonged stay in hospital."

A total of 102 cases of adult patients with HBeAg chronic hepatitis B were selected for testing. HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B patients took 10mg adefovir dipivoxil capsules once daily, while positive chronic hepatitis B patients were randomly divided into either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group was administrated with 10mg adefovir dipivoxil capsules, 1 time daily, and injected with 5 million U Recombinant Human Interferon α-2b through muscle every other day. The control group was treated with 10mg adefovir dipivoxil capsules, 1 time per day. We examined alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization and the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-DNA negative rate (undetectable rate), as well as, HBeAg / hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) sero-conversion rate to detect treatment effects. The results proved that after 6 months of medication therapy, the ALT normalization rate was 49.9% and the HBV-DNA negative conversion rate was 54.3%. 18 months into the treatment, showed an ALT normalization rate of 73.2%, while the HBV-DNA negative conversion rate grew to 76.8%. The use of adefovir dipivoxil treatment of the negative chronic HBV has a certain extent combined with α-2b Interferon therapy in treatment of HbeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. After a 48-week observation period, ALT normalization and HBV-DNA rate could not be measured, HBeAg/HBeAb sero-conversion rose higher, indicating that the treatment of the combined drugs is more efficient than taking adefovir dipivoxil by itself, and the data were comparable with the control group (P<0.05). Thus adefovir dipivoxil can greatly improve the restrain function to HBV-DNA and improve the immunity and control ability of the body, with obvious short-term effects, in combination with Interferon.

Prevalence rates of HBsAg ranged from 3.09% to 27% in the different islands of the group with a weighted mean of 10.48%, while the prevalence rate for at least one marker ranged from 46.91% to 81.03% with a weighted mean of 64.12%. In the 0-11 months and 1-4 years age groups, 2.08% and 10.57%, respectively, of the children were HBsAg carriers. These findings, when compared to the mean population carrier rate of 10.48%, suggest that HBV transmission occurred mostly after the first year of life. The highest prevalence rate for HBeAg positivity was in the 5-19 years age group (more than 40% of the HBsAg carriers were HBeAg positive), suggesting that contagiousness was greatest in childhood and adolescence. HBsAg was found in 11.45% of women of child-bearing age and HBeAg in 19.09% of women positive for HBsAg. It is concluded that immunization of newborns and infants, using vaccine alone, should be the most effective strategy for reducing HBV infection in the Austral Islands archipelago."
3750,0.005,1.0000,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) are known aetiology of cervical and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Both diseases share a similar clinical course, that is, the vast majority of those infected by these two viruses can eradicate the viruses spontaneously. A small sub-group who fails to clear the virus becomes chronic carrier and can progress to carcinoma many years later. We postulated that patients with pre-malignant or malignant cervical lesion are at increased risk of becoming chronic HBV carrier if infected, which may be attributed to inherent immunological deficiency against viral infection. We tested HBV carrier status from 288 patients with cervical carcinoma, 242 patients with high grade cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 311 women with neither of the above conditions as control subjects. The HBV carrier rate in the Cancer Group, CIN Group and Control Group was 21.4%, 24.1% and 10.6%. The carrier rate was significantly higher in both the Cancer Group (p<0.01) and the CIN Group (p<0.01), compared to the Control Group. Our study suggests that a common immunological mechanism is involved in eradication of HBV and HPV infections and inherent immuno-deficiency might lead to an association of HBV carrier status with cervical carcinoma. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and delineate the mechanism involved."
2526,0.005,1.0000,"Defective hepatitis B virus DNA (dDNA) is reverse-transcribed from spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic messenger RNA (pgRNA) and has been identified in patients with chronic HBV (CH-B). The major 2.2-kb spliced pgRNA encodes a novel HBV gene product, the hepatitis B splice protein (HBSP) via a deletion and frame shift within the polymerase. Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."
502,0.005,1.0000,"The capacity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to infect resting cells and to produce progeny particles may contribute significantly to its pathogenicity in vivo. We previously reported that primary culture of resting CD4(+) CD38(+) T-lymphocyte subset had higher production rate of CXCR4-using (X4) HIV-1 than CD4(+) CD38(-) subset. Interleukin (IL)-4 highly contributed to the up-regulation of the X4 virus production in the CD38(+) subset. Here, we show evidences that IL-4 treatment of both resting CD38(+) and CD38(-) subsets allowed the adsorption, entry, and integration of X4 virus at similar rates, while the following viral transcription rate was significantly lower in the CD38(-) than CD38(+) subset. Treatment of the CD38 subsets with IL-4 or phytohemagglutinin revealed no association of X4 virus replication ability in the subsets with classic T-cell activation or proliferation. Interestingly, the activator protein (AP)-1 was significantly activated in the CD38(+) subset after IL-4 treatment, while both nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT)-6 were activated in the IL-4-treated CD38(-) and CD38(-) subsets at similar levels. Thus, IL-4-dependent X4 HIV-1 transcription occurs efficiently in the CD38(+) but not CD38(-) subset of CD4(+) population and AP-1 could play a significant role on viral transcription, leading to the up-regulated X4 virus production in the CD38(+) subset."
7558,0.005,1.0000,"T cells depend on costimulation by accessory cells for an immune response. Costimulatory macrophage activity involves the expression of B7 molecules whose expression is upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and downregulated by interleukin-10 (IL-10). The expression of low-affinity Fc gamma IIIR (CD16), in contrast, is upregulated in the presence of IL-10 and downregulated in the presence of IFN-gamma. In human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, the balance between IFN-gamma and IL-10 expression shifts toward IL-10 predominance. Herein, we compare B7 and CD16 macrophage phenotypes from healthy and from HIV-1-infected patients. Patient macrophages express B7 molecules in lower density than macrophages from healthy donors and are resistant to the upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression. B7 expression can be normalized in patient macrophages by treating them with anti IL-10 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and IFN-gamma together but not by treatment with either anti-IL-10 mAb or IFN-gamma alone. This finding suggests an excess of IL-10 in HIV-1 infection and an IFN-gamma deficiency, consistent with previous cytokine assessments in HIV-1-infected subjects. The upregulation of CD16 expression was readily induced in patient macrophages by treatment with IL-10 and was inhibited by treatment with IFN-gamma. CD16 expression identifies the subset of cytotoxic macrophages that has been shown to destroy CD4T cells, which they target through CD4-reactive immune-complexed HIV-1 envelope molecules."
7652,0.005,1.0000,"AL 721, a lipid mixture with reported in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via cell membrane or virion cholesterol depletion, was evaluated in a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging trial. Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent."

7457,0.005,1.0000,"CD8(+) T cells provide protective immune responses via both cytolytic and non-cytolytic mechanisms in subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the present study, we investigated the CD28 expression of CD8(+) T cells present in the peripheral blood lymphocyte subset isolated from chronically HIV-infected subjects. Using flow cytometric analysis, a continuous spectrum of CD28 intensity ranging from negative to high, which could be separated into CD28-negative, intermediate (int) and high, was seen for CD8(+) T cells. Our study focused mostly on the CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are CD57(-) CD27(+) CD45RO(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(low) CD62L(int). The proliferative capacity of CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells was intermediate between those of CD28(-) CD8(+) T cells and CD28(high) CD8(+) T cells. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells are specific for HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens as measured by human leucocyte antigen pentamer binding and produce both intracellular interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in response to their cognate viral peptides. The CD28(int) CD8(+) T cells have HIV-specific, CMV-specific and EBV-specific cytotoxic activity in response to their cognate viral peptides. These findings indicate that a subset of functional effector-memory CD8(+) T cells specific for HIV, CMV and EBV antigens may contribute to an efficient immune response in HIV-infected subjects."

The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."
4550,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1-associated dementia (HIV-D) remains a significant consequence of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. Since the clinical introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of HIV-D has decreased, yet the prevalence has increased as patients are living longer under treatment. Additionally, a less severe form of HIV-D, minor cognitive motor disorder, has become an increasing issue. Two different models have been proposed for virus entry in the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV-D. In the 'Trojan horse' model, the virus enters the CNS early carried by macrophages and infects resident glia; later in the course of infection, virus replication is activated and additional monocyte/macrophages are recruited into the CNS via cytokine/chemokine networks and endothelial-cell-leukocyte interactions at the blood-brain barrier. In the 'late invasion' model, an inherently invasive activated monocyte subset is expanded from bone marrow as a result of immune dysregulation in the periphery in the setting of AIDS. In this review we discuss these two separate, although not mutually exclusive, means for virus entry and persistence in the CNS. Additionally, we explore mechanisms for neuronal injury and apoptosis, including the role of virus, viral and host proteins, oxidative stress and products of infected or uninfected activated microglia and astrocytes. Potential therapeutic strategies are also briefly discussed."
8814,0.005,1.0000,"We investigated the circulating cytotoxic CD160+ CD8(high) subset in correlation to antiviral immunity and response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV+ subjects. The study included 45 treatment-naive patients receiving HAART for 18 months, retrospectively defined as good (n=29) and transient (n=16) responders. HIV-specific CD8 T lymphocyte levels were measured by IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag, in the presence of immobilized anti-CD160 mAb. We report a significantly increased baseline level of CD160+ CD8(high) subset in good therapy responders. CD160+ CD8(high) subset correlates with CD4+ T cell count, immune activation, and viral load. CD160+ CD8(high) lymphocytes contain a high amount of Granzyme B and include virus-specific T lymphocytes in HIV-1+ subjects. Co-stimulation through CD160 molecules enhances IFNgamma production in response to p17 Gag. Therefore, the CD160+ CD8(high) subset may be useful for monitoring of virus-specific cellular immunity and predicting response to antiretroviral therapy in chronic HIV-1 infection."
237,0.005,1.0000,"Here, we found that a 6-mer peptide, Poly6, derived from the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which overlaps with a polymerase corresponding to a preS1 deletion reported to contribute to liver disease progression, can elicit an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by inhibiting HIV-1 integrase (IN) activity of infected cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the anti-HIV-1 effects of Poly6 occurred via the inhibition of integration, which resulted from the inhibition of acetylation of HIV-1 IN possibly by downregulation of p300 histone acetyltransferase. Our data suggest the potential therapeutic use of a 6-mer HBV-derived peptide, Poly6, as an anti-HIV-1 agent to suppress HIV-1 infection via inhibiting integrase activity."
6503,0.005,1.0000,"Since the middle of 1987, fewer consistently defined AIDS cases have been reported than expected among homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. This ""AIDS deficit"" was greater among homosexual and bisexual men in New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but was also striking among all homosexual and bisexual men in the United States. Deficits were virtually absent among intravenous drug users (IVDUs) in the United States. Three independent sources of data--placebo-controlled trials, pharmaceutical company reports, and the San Francisco Men's Health Study--were used to demonstrate that the amounts of zidovudine (AZT) given prophylactically to those at highest risk of AIDS since March 1987 have been sufficient to account for most of the observed AIDS deficits. Other advances in the medical care of pre-AIDS patients may have combined with AZT to produce the deficits. Other hypothesized explanations were examined and found insufficient to account for the observed AIDS deficits, including: (a) a sudden halt in new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections during the early or mid-1980s; (b) misspecification of the distribution of AIDS incubation times following HIV infection; (c) increasing delays in the reporting of AIDS cases; (d) changes in the surveillance definition of AIDS in 1987; and (e) evolution of attenuated HIV strains. The hypothesis that therapy is affecting national AIDS rates has important implications. Failure to take the effects of therapy into account can lead to serious underestimates by back-calculation of the cumulative numbers infected with HIV and of AIDS incidence over the longer term. Moreover, it appears that AIDS incidence could be retarded in underserved groups, such as IVDUs, by making AZT and other state-of-the-art treatments readily available to AIDS-free patients with advanced immunodeficiency."
854,0.005,1.0000,"As the incidence of HIV increases, one of the major steps in preventing a widespread epidemic is to make certain that medical students are prepared to recognize and treat HIV infections and their related conditions, and to counsel patients about avoiding risks that might lead to infections. This cross-sectional study assessed the knowledge level of 357 medical students and their attitudes about AIDS and HIV enrolled in a Medical College in Karachi, Pakistan. Only 6% of the students had complete knowledge on symptoms of HIV/AIDS and 7% of the students had complete knowledge on the modes of transmission of HIV. Statistical analysis of demographic factors affecting knowledge was done. Linear regression and Maentel-Haenszel tests showed that older and clinical students were more knowledgeable of symptoms and modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS. Ten attitudes were correlated with knowledge and none of these showed an association. These results on knowledge indicate that education about HIV/AIDS should be incorporated in the curriculum and interventions must be taken by public health professionals to avoid poor treatment outcomes."

The average length of follow-up was 2.1 years among 1,110 children. Among the 924 susceptible children who were followed up, 10.6% had seroconversions for HBV markers, none of which was associated with clinical illness; the annual incidence of HBV infections was 5.0%. Among the 98 children who experienced HBV infections during the study, 23% became HBsAg carriers, and HBsAg persistence was age-related, with most carriers being among the youngest children infected. In contrast, among the children with HBV markers at the time of enrollment, 118 (49.2%) were HBsAg-positive and 86% were still positive on follow-up.

Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
3598,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate whether low CD4+ T-cell counts in healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Ethiopians influence tuberculosis (TB) immunological memory, tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion and reactivity rates were investigated among adults with and without HIV infection in urban settings in Ethiopia. Reaction to the TST was analyzed with purified protein derivative by the Mantoux technique. A total of 1,286 individuals with TST results of > or = 5-mm (n = 851) and < or = 4-mm (n = 435) induration diameters were included. Individuals with < or = 4-mm induration sizes were followed up for 21.4 +/- 9.5 months (mean +/- standard deviation) to observe skin test conversion. The overall TST reactivity (> or = 5-mm induration diameter) was 66.2% (n = 851). Reactivity was significantly lower among HIV-positive persons (40.5%) than among HIV-negative persons (68.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the above persons, 32 incident TB patients were checked for their TST status 13.05 +/- 11.1 months before diagnosis and reactivity was found among 22 (68.7%) of them. Of the TST-negative persons with 0- to 4-mm indurations who were followed up for 3 years, the conversion rate to positivity was 17.9/100 person-years of observation (PYO) (14.4/100 PYO and 18.3/100 PYO in HIV-positive and -negative persons, respectively). Despite lower absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers in Ethiopians, higher TST conversion and reactivity rates show the presence of a higher rate of latent TB infection and/or transmission. The lower TST positivity rate before a diagnosis of TB disease showed the lower sensitivity of the test. This indicates the need for other sensitive and specific diagnostic and screening methods to detect TB infection, particularly among HIV-positive persons, so that they can be given prophylactic isoniazid therapy."

We show here that the CCR6-CCL20 chemotactic axis is altered, with reduced CCL20 production by small intestine epithelial cells in treated HIV-1-infected individuals. This leads to impaired CCR6(+)CD4(+) T-cell homing, particularly Th17 cells, to the small intestine mucosa. In contrast, the frequency of gut FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells, specifically the CCR6(-) subset, was increased. The resulting imbalance in the Th17/CCR6(-) Treg ratio and the associated shift from interleukin (IL)-17 to IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) blunts CCL20 production by enterocytes, perpetuating a negative feedback for the recruitment of CCR6(+)CD4(+) T cells to the small intestine in treated HIV-1-infected individuals."

Data from two studies that enrolled subjects at different stages of disease progression were retrospectively combined. This analysis assessed the association between patient-specific factors and three measures of CD4 T-cell recovery after the initiation of triple-drug therapy: overall changes in CD4 cell counts; changes in CD4 cell counts during the first 8 weeks (phase I); and changes in CD4 cell counts during weeks 8-24 (phase II). Higher initial HIV-1 RNA values corresponded to greater increases in overall and phase I changes in mean CD4 cell counts, particularly among subjects with less advanced disease. In the overall and phase II cases, those subjects with suppressed HIV RNA levels had consistently higher increases in mean CD4 cell counts across both baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts than did the respective unsuppressed group. Based on a multivariate model, increases in mean phase I CD4 cell counts corresponded to higher log baseline HIV-1 RNA levels (p =.0001) and log changes in HIV-1 RNA levels at week 4 (p =.03). Patients with earlier stages of disease (p =.0001) and females (p =.01) had higher increases in phase I changes. Phase II CD4 cell counts did not depend solely on baseline HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts but on their interaction (p =.0001) as well as on achieving virologic suppression (p =.0009)."
2102,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."

During primary infection (day 14) of this rhesus macaque with the pathogenic SIVmac251 strain, proviruses were detected at similar frequencies in CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells (1/10) and CD4(+) T cells (1/10) and at a lower frequency in CD8(+) T cells (1/800). On day 235, no viral DNA was detected in CD8(+) cells, despite the persistent high viral load, indicating that CD8(+) cells do not constitute a reservoir during the chronic phase of SIV infection. Infection induced early lymphopenia of CD4(+), CD4(+) CD8(+), and CD8(+) cells; only the CD8(+) cell population returned to initial levels and expanded further. We found that CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells expressed the costimulatory CD28 molecule less and were more prone to die in vitro after phytohemagglutinin/interleukin 2 stimulation than were CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, massive death of CD4(+) CD8(+) T cells during acute stages of SIV infection may explain why CD8(+) T cells did not represent a major reservoir for SIV at the onset of infection."
5059,0.005,1.0000,"The chronic stage of HIV-1 infection has been extensively described as a slowly evolving phase, in which the virus induces T-cell death slightly faster than the human body is able to recover. In contrast, T-cell and viral replication dynamics during primary infection have been less well studied. Recent studies in the SIV-macaque model and in HIV-positive patients during the acute infection period have highlighted the massive and irreversible depletion of CD4 memory T cells in the mucosa, particularly in the gut. Hence, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) plays a central role in the early stages of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Due to its particular cytokine expression pattern, GALT may favour the differential replication of certain HIV-1 subtypes during primary infection, particularly of subtype C. This could enhance the chance of a successful transmission. Moreover, these early events taking place in GALT during primary infection have major implications for therapy and vaccine design."
5936,0.005,1.0000,"Interleukin (IL)-21 has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in controlling chronic viral infections. However, little is known about the regulatory role of IL-21 in T cell immunity during the process of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). In the present study, the levels of serum IL-21 in 77 patients with various degrees of CHB in immune clearance phase (IC), 25 patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in immune tolerance phase (IT), and 25 healthy controls (HC) were measured and their potential association with major clinic indexes was examined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CHB patients were stimulated with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) in the presence or absence of anti-IL-21 antibody or recombinant IL-21, and the frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) and interferon (IFN)-γ(+)CD8(+) T cells was characterized by flow cytometry. Our data indicated that the levels of serum IL-21 were significantly higher in the IC CHB patients than that in the other groups and were positively correlated with the levels of serum HBV DNA and HBeAg in the IC patients. There was a low frequency of HBcAg-specific IL-21(+)CD4(+) T cells in IC CHB patients. Further, IL-21 enhanced HBcAg-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell proliferation, while treatment with anti-IL-21 inhibited antigen-specific IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell expansion in vitro. Our findings imply that IL-21 positively regulates proinflammatory IFN-γ(+)CD8(+) T cell responses during the process of chronic HBV infection in humans. "
406,0.005,1.0000,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

Serum anti-HIV antibodies were detected by ELISA and their presence confirmed by immunoblotting in 4 (3.1%) individuals, three males and one female, with different degrees of pulmonary TB. Of the males, 1 was bisexual, 2 were promiscuous, and the female was the sexual partner of a non symptomatic HIV-infected man. No immunological disturbances or other AIDS related alterations were observed. There was one case of miliary TB, but neither atypical X-ray abnormalities nor extrapulmonary involvement were found. Tuberculin reaction was positive in three of the four HIV infected patients. Clinical, radiological and bacteriological evolution were favorable. Adverse drug reaction occurred in two cases, one of them presenting serious toxidermia caused by isoniazid. Of the 130 individuals, 12 presented risk factors for HIV infection so that the prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies presented here, 4 cases out of 12, is consistent with data from previous reports for high risk populations."
5736,0.005,1.0000,"The cytopathic effect of HIV on CD4 T cells, as well as the active autoimmune mechanism occurring during infection, have been documented. Of the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS, the main one produced by the monocyte-macrophage series is tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF alpha). This cytokine induces antigens such as proteinase 3 (Pr 3) or mieloperoxidase (MPO). Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are directed against this type of PMN antigens. In the present paper, the role of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in HIV infected patients as responsible for autoimmune phenomena in relation to opportunistic infections, was studied. A total of 88 serum samples belonging to 49 asymptomatic and 39 symptomatic HIV infected patients were tested for ANCA by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test over a neutrophil substrate. ANCA were detected in 53.8% of symptomatic patients as compared to 4.1% in asymptomatic cases (p < 0.0001). A 95.9% correlation was observed between ANCA-positive samples and pulmonary infection (n = 20). In those ANCA (+) samples 95.9% correlation was found with pulmonary infection (n = 20). Pulmonary infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a frequent finding in HIV infected patients from Northeastern Argentina. When the presence of ANCA in TB(+) HIV(+) and TB(+) HIV(-) patients was studied, it was seen that positive-ANCA significantly correlated with the first group (p < 0.001). The presence of ANCA was not related to viral infections, toxoplasmosis, neurological features of AIDS, vasculitis or malignant diseases. ANCA during pulmonary infection, mostly caused by TB, as well as PMN infiltration in pulmonary parenchyma, and the deregulated immune reaction elicited by HIV, may contribute to the onset of autoimmune phenomena. The presence of human T lymphocytes reactive to heat stress proteins (Hsp), an important target of immune response against certain intracellular auto-antigens such as MPO from PMN, added to the mechanism of molecular mimicry, could explain the association of ANCA and TB in patients with severe alterations of their immune response. According to these results, the limited presence of ANCA in asymptomatic patients HIV(+) and in HIV(-) with pulmonar TB, could indicate that the virus may not be responsible for the induction of these antibodies."
2940,0.005,1.0000,"Objective To assess the implementation of HIV-related interventions for patients with tuberculosis (TB), as well as TB treatment outcomes in patients coinfected with HIV in Brazil in 2011. Methods This was a cross-sectional, operational research study of HIV-related interventions among TB cases and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV coinfected patients. It also used a retrospective cohort design to determine the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and favorable TB treatment outcomes. The source of data was a linkage of 2011 administrative health databases used by the National TB and HIV/AIDS Programs. Results Of 73 741 new cases of TB reported, 63.6% (46 865 patients) were tested for HIV; 10.3% were positive. Of patients with HIV, 45.9% or 3 502 were on ART. TB favorable outcome was achieved in 63.1% or 2 205 coinfected patients on ART and in only 35.4% or 1 459 of those not on ART. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for the association between ART and TB treatment success was 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.64-1.81). Conclusions The linkage between national TB and HIV datasets has created a convenient baseline for ongoing monitoring of HIV testing, ART use, and TB treatment outcomes among coinfected patients. The low rates of HIV screening and ART use in 2011 need to be improved. The association between ART and treatment success adds to the evidence supporting timely initiation of ART for all patients with TB-HIV coinfection."
9648,0.005,1.0000,"Cigarette smoking among people living with HIV/AIDS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, but findings regarding the association between cigarette smoking and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts have been inconsistent. This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."
384,0.005,1.0000,"It is not known whether the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) &#x03B5;4 allelic variant is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) in a South African population, where HIV clade C is predominant. ApoE genotyping was performed on 144 participants in a larger study of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). There was a lower frequency of the &#x03B5;2 and &#x03B5;3 alleles in the HIV-positive group, compared to a group of 300 community-based newborn infants. There were no differences in ApoE genotype across different categories of HAND. The &#x03B5;4 allelic variant was less common in individuals with HAD than in those without HAD. These findings suggest that the &#x03B5;4 allelic variant in HIV-positive individuals is not associated with the development of HAD in Southern Africa."
889,0.005,1.0000,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ genetic polymorphisms have been associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) outcomes. We aimed to determine impacts of HLA-DQ polymorphisms and their interactions with HBV mutations on the risks of liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). rs2856718 (A>G) and rs9275319 (A>G) were genotyped in 1342 healthy controls, 327 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, 611 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers (ASCs), 1144 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 734 LC patients, and 1531 HCC patients using quantitative PCR. HBV mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess the factors and/or multiplicative interactions significantly associated with liver diseases. rs9275319 variant genotypes were inversely associated with HBV persistence compared to HBV natural clearance subjects. rs2856718 variant genotypes significantly increased LC risk compared to ASCs plus CHB patients (GG vs. AA: odds ratio [OR], 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.97 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.54) and decreased HCC risk compared to HCC-free HBV-infected subjects (AG vs. AA: OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89 and AG+GG vs. AA: OR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.68-0.90). rs2856718 variant genotypes were significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV A1726C mutation, a LC-risk, HCC-protective mutation, in genotype C. A rs9275319 variant genotype (GG) was significantly associated with an increased frequency of preS1 start codon mutation, an HCC-risk mutation, in genotype C. The interaction of rs2856718 AG+GG genotype with T1753V, a HCC-risk mutation, significantly reduced LC risk, with an OR of 0.26 (95% CI, 0.09-0.78); whereas the interaction of rs2856718 AG genotype with C1673T, a LC-risk mutation, significantly increased HCC risk, with an OR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.02-7.66) in genotype C HBV-infected subjects. Conclusively, the HLA-DQ polymorphisms affect the risks of LC and HCC differently in chronic HBV-infected subjects, possibly via interacting with the HBV mutations. "
5668,0.005,1.0000,Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a well-recognized clinical entity characterized by the detection of HBV DNA in serum and/or liver in the absence of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The frequency of the diagnosis depends on the relative sensitivity of both HBsAg and HBV DNA assays. We aimed at determining the prevalence of occult HBV infection in a high risk group of children who developed HBV infection despite immunoprophylaxis.
3604,0.005,1.0000,"In a prospective study of 214 patients who had elective extensive operations for fractures, we compared the relative frequencies of postoperative infections in the seventeen patients who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus and had associated clinical symptoms, in the twenty-six patients who were seropositive and had no associated clinical symptoms, and in the 171 patients who were seronegative. The relative frequency of postoperative infection was significantly higher in patients who were seropositive and had associated clinical symptoms (four of seventeen) than in patients who were seronegative (eight of 171) (Fisher exact test, p = 0.01). In all patients who were seropositive and had a postoperative bacterial infection, treatment with antibiotics was effective. The results of this study suggest that people who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus and have associated symptoms are at increased risk for postoperative infection."
9833,0.005,1.0000,"Stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) is the principal ligand for CXCR4, a co-receptor with CD4 for T lymphocyte cell line-tropic human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). A common polymorphism, SDF1-3' A, was identified in an evolutionary conserved segment of the 3' untranslated region of the SDF-1 gene. Sequence analysis revealed a common variant at position 801, a G-->A transition referred to as SDF1-3' A. Because this variant eliminates the Msp I restriction site PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used for rapid detection of genotypes. We genotyped 62 HIV infected patients and 60 non-HIV blood donors by RFLP analysis. We also assessed syncytia formation through co-culture of MT-2 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV patients. Syncytium-inducing HIV-1 variants have been shown to be clinically significant in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In our study, we detected a low frequency of 3'A/3'A (5%) in the blood donors but this genotype was absent in all HIV patients. We found that 41 (68%) HIV patients including syncytia inducing (SI) and non-syncytia inducing (NSI) groups contained the wild type (wt/wt) genotype for SDF-1. Our data indicate that there is no correlation between SDF-1 alleles and syncytium inducing HIV."
2948,0.005,1.0000,"HIV/HCV coinfected patients tend to develop hepatitis C (HCV)-associated liver disorders. Because the chemokine receptor CXCR3 participates in lymphocyte trafficking during hepatic inflammation, it may participate in the escalated liver disorders of coinfected patients. However, to date, the relative frequency and density of receptor on lymphocytes has not been established. This study compared the CXCR3(+) phenotype under various in vitro conditions between lymphocytes from healthy and coinfected individuals. Peripheral lymphocytes were stimulated with phytohemagluttinin for 0-7 d and phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. Secreted cytokines were measured in culture supernatants by ELISA. Phenotypic differences were observed between groups. CD4(+)CXCR3(+) frequency between groups was equivalent before and during early activation, but increased only among non-infected individuals during late activation (p<0.001). In contrast, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency was consistently greater (p<0.05) among HIV/HCV patients throughout activation. Among those who were non-infected, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency increased (p=0.002) during late activation. However, CD8(+)CXCR3(+) frequency among HIV/HCV patients increased within 24 h of activation (p=0.008), and was nearly universal by late activation (p<0.001). Both groups elaborated Th-1 cytokine profiles; however, coinfected patients released more inflammatory cytokines (p<0.01) than non-infected individuals. In summary, we demonstrated that CD8(+) lymphocytes from HIV/HCV-infected patients expressed more CXCR3 and showed greater upregulatory ability upon activation. The atypical CXCR3 expression and enhanced Th-1 cytokine elaboration among coinfected patients could potentially stimulate increased lymphocyte migration during hepatic inflammation."
9637,0.005,1.0000,"Since 1996, AIDS has declined in the Italian population, but cases in foreign patients, including both recent immigrants and long-term residents, have increased from 3.9% in 1995-1996 to 15.4% in 2001-2002. This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7). CD4 cell count (p = 0.9) and log plasma HIV-RNA (p = 0.1). Characteristics of HAART patients were compared to those of nontreated patients, despite a CD4 cell count less than 350 cells/mm(3). No significant difference was found for gender, country of origin, risk factor, and years of Italian residence, while legal immigrants (p = 0.018) and registered in the National Health Service (p = 0.014) were significantly more likely to receive HAART compared to illegal immigrants."

Cocultivation of the peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient with normal donor leukocytes yielded a leukocyte culture in which HIV virus expression was demonstrated. The HIV antigen was detected in the ultracentrifugate of the cultures by means of indirect enzyme-immunoassay using sera to the virus from the standard kits of Organon (Netherlands) and Abbot (USA). HIV antigen was also detected on the surface of lymphocytes in the culture by indirect immunofluorescence using the same sera.

8719,0.005,1.0000,"Recent evidence suggests an association between cervical condyloma, dysplasia and HIV infection. However, the course of cervical cancer in immunodeficient patients has not yet been thoroughly researched. Cervical cancer presently amounts to 1% of the causes of death in AIDS patients. This percentage is bound to increase not only because an improved life expectancy has been obtained, but mainly because the virus is widely spreading among the female population. A 28 year-old AIDS patient, parity 1/0/1/1, underwent gynecological examination and colposcopy following an episode of vaginal bleeding. Biopsy revealed an invasive cervical carcinoma. The last gynecologic investigation, which included a Pap smear and colposcopy, was performed 14 months earlier and resulted negative. Cytologic reexamination of the specimen confirmed the previous Pap smear result. Proctoscopy and cystoscopy showed no mucose involvement. Urography was negative. The cat scan indicated minor spleen and liver enlargement but no signs of malignant abdominal spread were found. The neoplasia was classified as a stage IIB cervical carcinoma (according to the FIGO classification) due to the spread to the left cardinal ligament. In spite of radiation therapy, the disease rapidly progressed leading to a monolateral ureteral involvement which created a juxtavescical stenosis. The patient died three months later. Necroscopic examination revealed lung metastasis. Such a rapidly progressive form of cervical cancer could be related to the acquired immunodeficiency condition. Recurrent cytological and colposcopic examinations are to be considered mandatory in HIV patients."
2522,0.005,1.0000,"The HBV in the sera of two chronic active hepatitis patients were analyzed for the promoter sequence heterogeneity. In most cases, the proportion of any particular clone in the total viral populations was less than 50%, showing high mutation rates. In contrast, promoter sequences of HBV from asymptomatic carriers revealed only a few point mutations with no deletions. HBV in chronic patient harbored variants with multiple mutations throughout promoters including 1762 (A-to-T), 1764 (G-to-A) double mutation in C promoter and deletions near CCAAT site in S promoter. Unlike other three promoter regions, C, pre-S1 and S, of HBV which revealed a high level of sequence heterogeneity, the X promoter region (from nt985 to 1430) showed little sequence heterogeneity within a patient. However, the predominant viral clones in two patients were quite different from each other. In addition to mutations in promoter regions, a deletion mutation in the translation start codon was also found in pre-S1 gene. The results in this report indicate that the mutation rates are not the same in all four promoters and that one of the strategies for maintaining persistent infection could be through mutations in viral promoters which then impair the balance of viral gene expressions."
2550,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of primary zidovudine (AZT)-resistance (mutation T215Y/F) or lamivudine (3TC)-resistance (mutation M184V) was evaluated in 90 drug-naive patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) between 1987 and 1997. The proportion of mutant strains in proviral samples or plasma viral samples was determined using a differential hybridization assay. Mutation T215Y/F was found in five (5.6%) patients infected between 1994 and 1997, whereas none of these patients harbored the mutation M184V. The T215Y/F mutation was present in the virus and/or provirus and persisted for at least two years. In one patient, the mutant provirus was associated with only wild-type free virus. Four of these patients were followed, and two were treated subsequently to a regimen containing AZT but with low response. The persistence of primary resistance mutations might depend on the proportion of these mutations at the time of infection, although mutant provirus might not give rise to replicating variants."
6446,0.005,1.0000,"Multiple mutations were found in the human immunodeficiency virus pol gene following treatment of an AIDS patient with antiretroviral drugs. After approximately 2.5 years of monthly alternating therapy with 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), most of the pol sequences amplified from the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA contained known AZT resistance mutations at codons 41, 67, and 215 and a putative ddC resistance mutation at codon 69 as well as other novel mutations. These mutations persisted for 6 months after the patient was switched to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine monotherapy. Mutations known to be associated with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine resistance did not occur during this time. Antiviral susceptibility testing of point mutants, introduced into the genetic background of laboratory strain NL4-3, showed that the codon 41 mutation antagonized ddC resistance when present with the codon 69 mutation. However, this antagonism was not found with a chimeric mutant containing the patient's pol gene sequence from codons 25 to 218, implying that other mutations compensated for the antagonism. Thus, alternating therapy with AZT and ddC resulted in the selection of viruses resistant to both drugs."

In this study, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OH2'dG), a metabolite of oxidized DNA, was measured to determine if antiretroviral therapy leads to oxidative damage to DNA. A cross-sectional study was carried out measuring urinary 8OH2'dG in three groups of HIV-infected patients: (1) antiretroviral medication naïve, (2) patients on antiretroviral medications without lipodystrophy and (3) patients on antiretroviral medications with lipodystrophy. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in each group. The mean spot urinary 8OH2'dG measurements per mg creatinine for the three groups were: antiretroviral naïve 4.27 +/- 0.61 (ng 8OH2'dG/mg creatinine +/- SEM), on antiretroviral medications without lipodystrophy 2.88 +/- 0.26, and on antiretroviral medications with lipodystrophy 3.27 +/- 0.30. The differences between the means of the three groups is not statistically significant (p = 0.055), and these results are not significantly different from reported values for healthy controls [A carbon column-based liquid chromatography electrochemical approach to routine 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine measurements in urine and other biologic matrices: a one-year evaluation of methods.

Initial evaluation of these parameters was conducted in the western countries where accessible ARVs, circulating HIV subtypes and mode of transmission are different from the situation in Nigeria. This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART. The importance of combined use of both parameters for evaluation of immunologic and virologic responses to ART was confirmed. "
7037,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, previously shown to confer an enhanced replicative capacity and broadened host range to the ELI1 strain of HIV-1, were analyzed for their biochemical effects on envelope structure and function. The tendency of purified virions to release their extracellular gp120 component, either spontaneously or after interacting with soluble CD4 (CD4-induced shedding) was assessed. A single amino acid substitution in part of the CD4 binding site of gp120 (Gly-427 to Arg) enhanced both spontaneous and CD4-induced shedding of gp120 from virions, while a single change in the fusogenic region of gp41 (Met-7 to Val) affected only CD4-induced shedding. Although each codon change alone conferred increased growth ability, virus with both mutations exhibited the most rapid replication kinetics. In addition, when both of these mutations were present, virions had the highest tendency to shed gp120, both spontaneously and after exposure to soluble CD4. Analysis of CD4 binding to virion-associated gp120 showed that the changes in both gp120 and gp41 contributed to increased binding. These results demonstrated that the increased replicative capacity of the ELI variants in human CD4+ cell lines was associated with altered physical and functional properties of the virion envelope glycoproteins."

We evaluated hepatitis B vaccine immunogenicity among residents immunized in response to two such outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities during June 2009-July 2010. One hundred forty-eight (71%) of 209 residents were found to be susceptible to HBV infection. Of 105 patients who began a vaccination series with Twinrix(®) (0-, 1-, 6-month dosing), 86 (82%) completed the series and postvaccination testing. Of these, most were elderly (median age 79.5 years; range 45-101), female (56%), and African-American (51%). Twenty-nine (34%) vaccinated residents had post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody levels ≥10 mIU/ml. There were no significant differences in vaccine response by age, gender, race, diabetes status, body mass index, or current smoking status. Our findings indicate that a low proportion of skilled nursing facility residents achieved a seroprotective response after hepatitis B vaccination."
5114,0.005,1.0000,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."
8408,0.005,1.0000,"Bone mineral density (BMD) abnormalities are observed frequently among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Risk factors for reduced BMD in the setting of HIV have been previously studied, but detailed antiretroviral treatment history is often not available. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between 2005 and 2007 among unselected HIV-infected adults attending an ambulatory urban HIV clinic. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans of lumbar spine and femoral neck, full laboratory profile, detailed questionnaire, and antiretroviral history were obtained. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate factors associated with BMD below the expected range for age. Two hundred ninety patients completed the study: 80% Caucasians, 89% males, with median age of 49 yr. Low BMD as assessed by Z-score was present in 19.7% of the patients. By multivariate analysis, only lower body mass index (BMI) was an independent risk factor for low BMD. Cumulative exposure to protease inhibitors, non-nucleosides, and individual nucleoside and nucleotide analogs were not independently associated with low BMD. In conclusion, a 19.7% prevalence of abnormal BMD by DXA scan was identified in an unselected group of HIV-infected adults. Lower BMI was independently associated with low BMD. No correlation was found between abnormal BMD and cumulative exposure to any antiretroviral agents."
2013,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to examine the extent of unprotected sex among patients already established in HIV-medical care and their associated factors. Sexually active patients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from five public hospitals in Trang province, Southern Thailand, were interviewed. Of 279 studied patients, 37.3% had unprotected sex in the prior 3 months and 27.2% did not disclose their serostatus to sexual partners. The median duration interquartile range (IQR) of using ART was 47 (27-60) months and 26.7% were non-adherent to ART (i.e., taking less than 95% of the prescribed doses). More than one-third had the perception that ART use would protect against HIV transmission even with unprotected sex. About 36.6% reported that they were unaware of their current CD4 counts and nearly one-third did not receive any safe sex counseling at each medical follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, non-adherence to ART and HIV-nondisclosure were strongly associated with an increase in the risk of unprotected sex with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 5.03 (95% CI 2.68-9.44) and 3.89 (95% CI 1.57-9.61), respectively. In contrast, the risk for engaging in unprotected sex was less likely among patients having a negative-serostatus partner (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.12-0.75), a longer duration of the use of ART (aOR = 0.98; 95%CI 0.97-0.99) and an unawareness of their current CD4 levels (aOR = 0.54; 95% CI 0.30-0.99). To maximize the benefits from ART, there should be a bigger emphasis on the ""positive prevention"" program and more efforts are needed to target the population at risk for unprotected sex. Strategies to encourage adherence to ART and for disclosure of serostatus are also required. "
1407,0.005,1.0000,"A prevalence study of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was conducted in Kinshasa, Zaïre, among 258 children 2-24 months old who were in hospital, 191 children 1-20 months old who were attending a well-child clinic, and their mothers. 8% of the mothers of both groups of children were seropositive. Among children under 9 months old, 12 of 102 (12%) hospital inpatients and 11 of 136 (8%) clinic attenders were seropositive, while in the 9-24-month age group 20 of 156 (13%) hospital children and only 1 of 55 (2%) clinic children were seropositive (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.01). 61% of the seropositive children had seropositive mothers, indicating a high rate of vertical transmission. Factors associated with seropositivity among hospital children with seronegative mothers included male sex, increased lifetime number of medical injections, and previous blood transfusion or hospital admission. Among children who had not previously been transfused or admitted to hospital the seropositives had received more medical injections than the seronegatives (median 34.5 versus 14.5; Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.006). HIV infection accounted for or complicated a substantial proportion of hospital paediatric admissions. Public health measures are urgently required to prevent parenteral and vertical transmission of HIV to infants and young children in Kinshasa."

Fifteen patients developed immune recovery uveitis (IRU); 3 of the patients developed extensive retinal neovascularization, 1 of whom required vitrectomy for recurrent vitreous hemorrhages. These late complications indicate a need for continued ophthalmologic follow-up of HIV-infected patients who have a history of CMV retinitis, even for individuals who have not required anti-CMV therapy for >4 years."
132,0.005,1.0000,"Over the past 6 to 7 years an increasing incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (AHCV) has been fuelled by two different changing epidemics: (1) a new resurgence of AHCV amongst intravenous drug users (IVDU); and (2) presumed sexually transmitted AHCV amongst predominantly HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM). Increasing incidence amongst IVDUs is likely to be a consequence of changing injecting behaviour, possibly related to changes in perception of HIV as well as HCV risk and consequences. Increasing incidence amongst MSM is likely to be a consequence of changing sexual practices, for example number of sexual partners and type of sexual behaviour, as well as increasing availability of recreational drugs associated with sexual risk-taking, and wider availability of casual sexual partners via the internet or sex-on-premises venues. It remains unclear whether the current outbreaks in MSM, predominantly seen in HIV-positive individuals, reflect a predisposition to AHCV secondary to HIV status per se, or whether this reflects differences in behaviour amongst HIV-positive versus HIV-negative MSM, or potentially increased screening (either routine or secondary to abnormal liver function tests) in HIV-positive MSM. The majority of individuals with AHCV are asymptomatic and therefore routine screening of individuals in at-risk groups with abnormal liver function tests should be considered. Previous historical studies suggest that individuals with concomitant HIV infection are far less likely than those without to spontaneously clear HCV. It is currently recommended that such individuals acutely infected with HCV should undergo monitoring of HCV viral load levels to determine whether spontaneous clearance is likely or whether the opportunity for early treatment should be considered."
4136,0.005,1.0000,"This study investigates the prevalence and correlates of sexual activity and HIV-risk behavior among adults with a mental disorder. Demographic, psychiatric, sexual behavior, and substance-use data were available for 1,558 outpatients. During the past year, 69% were sexually active and 23% engaged in risky behavior. Risk markers included multiple sexual partners (19%), a sexually transmitted disease (4%), sex trading (3%), injection drug use (1%), and needle sharing (<1%). Being sexually active and being at risk for HIV infection were associated with alcohol and drug use, psychiatric diagnoses other than schizophrenia, and younger age. Married patients were more likely to be sexually active but less likely to engage in risk behavior. Screening for HIV risk in psychiatric settings can identify patients who may benefit from risk reduction programs."
2809,0.005,1.0000,"GB virus C (GBV-C) is an apathogenic virus that has been shown to inhibit HIV replication. This study examined the prevalence and correlates of GBV-C infection and clearance in three cohorts of pregnant women in Thailand. The study population consisted of 1,719 (1,387 HIV-infected and 332 HIV-uninfected) women from three Bangkok perinatal HIV transmission studies. Stored blood was tested for GBV-C RNA, GBV-C antibody, and if RNA-positive, genotype. Risk factors associated with the prevalence of GBV-C infection (defined as presence of GBV-C RNA and/or antibody) and viral clearance (defined as presence of GBV-C antibody in the absence of RNA) among women with GBV-C infection were examined using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of GBV-C infection was 33% among HIV-infected women and 15% among HIV-uninfected women. GBV-C infection was independently associated (AOR, 95% CI) with an increasing number of lifetime sexual partners (referent-1 partner, 2 partners [1.60, 1.22-2.08], 3-10 partners [1.92, 1.39-2.67], >10 partners [2.19, 1.33-3.62]); injection drug use (5.50, 2.12-14.2); and HIV infection (3.79, 2.58-5.59). Clearance of GBV-C RNA among women with evidence of GBV-C infection was independently associated with increasing age in years (referent <20, 20-29 [2.01, 1.06-3.79] and ≥30 [3.18, 1.53-6.60]), more than 10 lifetime sexual partners (3.05, 1.38-6.75), and HIV infection (0.29, 0.14-0.59). This study found that GBV-C infection is a common infection among Thai women and is associated with HIV infection and both sexual and parenteral risk behaviors."
8897,0.005,1.0000,"Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the United States in the mid-1990s, the life expectancy of U.S. children who were infected perinatally with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased substantially. As a result, the number of perinatally HIV-infected females in the United States who are becoming both sexually active and pregnant is increasing. During August 1998-May 2002, a total of 10 pregnancies were identified among eight perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults in Puerto Rico; in April 2002, the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) asked CDC to assist in assessing such pregnancies. This report describes these pregnancies and discusses factors associated with sexual activity and pregnancy. The findings suggest that increasing numbers of pregnancies will occur among perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults and that appropriately tailored reproductive health interventions should be developed."
1803,0.005,1.0000,"Prevalence of and risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were determined among 252 homosexual men with no history of intravenous drug use (median age 33 years, range 18-77) treated at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Rome. The overall prevalence of antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) was 50.8%, a rate nearly nine times as high as the 5.8% found recently in a national sample of young male adults, aged 18-26 years, and twice as high as the 22% found in heterosexuals attending the same clinic over the same period of time. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of anti-HBc positivity was independently associated with increasing age, five or more sexual partners in the previous year, positive HIV serology and positive syphilis serology. Lower level of schooling, lack of condom use, history of non-ulcerative STD, current or past history of genital herpes, and positive anti-HCV serology were not associated with anti-HBc positivity. These findings corroborate the importance of sexual transmission of HBV in homosexual men. Behavioural factors, such as multiple sexual partners, probably enhance the efficiency of this mode of HBV transmission."
2378,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the change in sexual behavior among homosexual men observed after the start of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic resulted in a change in herpes simplex virus (HSV) seroprevalence in this group over time. In a cross-sectional study, the prevalence of herpesvirus types 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2) was determined at study entry in 1984-1985 and 1995-1997 among 532 young (aged < or = 30 years) homosexual men participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV/AIDS. Risk factors for the presence of HSV antibodies, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, were evaluated, and their influence on HSV prevalence over time was assessed. A strong decrease in HSV1 and HSV2 seroprevalence, from 80.6% to 59.0% and from 51.3% to 19.0%, respectively, was observed between the two time periods. This decrease was not markedly influenced by various demographic and socioeconomic factors. After data were controlled for several markers of sexual activity (such as number of sex partners, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and past episode(s) of gonorrhea), it appeared that the decline in HSV seroprevalence was explained by a concurrent decrease in the presence of these markers. The authors conclude that among young homosexual men in this study, the strong decrease in HSV seroprevalence was associated with a concurrent shift in sexual behavior. Furthermore, these data suggest an increasing sexual component in HSV1 transmission over time."
4070,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in patients on hemodialysis. As no useful noninvasive predictors of disease activity and fibrosis have been found, liver biopsy is essential in these patients to accurately assess the severity of disease and thus the prognosis and plan management. The present study was undertaken to assess the degree of severity of necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis in liver biopsies of patients on hemodialysis with chronic HCV infection. Liver biopsies obtained from 45 patients on hemodialysis with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis C were studied. The grading of necroinflammatory activity and staging of fibrosis were histologically assessed. The majority of patients (30, i.e. 66.7%) had mild disease with mild inflammatory activity and stage 0, 1 or 2 fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the degree of fibrosis and the age of the patients (rs = 0.015), the duration of hemodialysis (rs = 0.047) or the presence of steatosis (rs = 0.064). There was a positive correlation between the presence of bile ductular proliferation and the severity of fibrosis (rs = 0.612). It was concluded that chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients is relatively mild early in its course. However, serial follow-up liver biopsies are mandatory to plan appropriate intervention strategies."
6181,0.005,1.0000,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."

661,0.005,1.0000,"Seven hundred and four HIV-1/2-positive, antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve patients were screened for HTLV-1 infection. Antibodies to HTLV-1 were found in 32/704 (4.5%) of the patients. Each co-infected individual was matched with two HIV mono-infected patients according to World Health Organization clinical stage, age +/-5 years and gender. Key clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Mono-infected and co-infected patients displayed similar clinical characteristics. However, co-infected patients had higher absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.001), higher percentage CD4+ T-cell counts (P < 0.001) and higher CD4/CD8 ratios (P < 0.001). Although HIV plasma RNA viral loads were inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell-counts in mono-infected patients (P < 0.0001), a correlation was not found in co-infected individuals (P = 0.11). Patients with untreated HIV and HTLV-1 co-infection show a dissociation between immunological and HIV virological markers. Current recommendations for initiating ART and chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in resource-poor settings rely on more readily available CD4+ T-cell counts without viral load parameters. These guidelines are not appropriate for co-infected individuals in whom high CD4+ T-cell counts persist despite high HIV viral load states. Thus, for co-infected patients, even in resource-poor settings, HIV viral loads are likely to contribute information crucial for the appropriate timing of ART introduction."
9298,0.005,1.0000,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common because of their shared modes of transmission. HIV infection alters the natural history of HBV infection, leading to more severe liver disease, decreased hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and higher HBV DNA levels. Furthermore, end-stage liver disease has emerged as a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. For these reasons, it is important to vaccinate susceptible persons against HBV infection and to diagnose and treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected persons. The treatment plan for chronic hepatitis B needs to be individualized based on the stage of both viral infections and the available options. It is anticipated that we are entering a period of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but the ideal combination needs to be elucidated."

The results of the double-blind phase have been reported. Of 866 HIV-seropositive patients randomized, 832 subjects were eligible for efficacy analysis. On completion of the double-blind phase, 596 patients started open treatment. All patients were evaluated with regard to progression to AIDS and/or death. Within 48 weeks, 10/412 (2.4%) patients assigned isoprinosine and 27/420 (6.4%) patients assigned placebo progressed to AIDS (P = 0.005). Intention-to-treat analysis showed identical results. Viewing the open treatment phase in isolation revealed no difference in progression rates between those treated and those not receiving the drug, perhaps reflecting the higher proportion of patients receiving zidovudine or PCP prophylaxis in the latter group. No severe adverse reactions or toxicities were observed. We conclude that HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS may be safely and effectively treated with isoprinosine."

To determine the incidence of paradoxical responses in patients with AIDS and TB who are treated with antituberculous therapy and subsequently with combination antiretroviral therapy (ARV), we conducted a prospective study of 33 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy and antiretroviral therapy (Group 1) compared with 55 HIV-seronegative TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy (Group 2) and 28 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy but not on antiretrovirals (historical control; Group 3). In Group 1 patients, paradoxical responses were temporally more related to the initiation of ARV than to the initiation of anti-TB therapy (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 11 d versus 109 +/- 72 d [p < 0.001]) and occurred much more frequently (12 of 33; 36%) compared with Group 2 (1 of 55; 2%) (p < 0.001) or with Group 3 (2 of 28; 7%) (p = 0.013). The majority of patients who experienced paradoxical responses and received tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) in Group 1 had their tuberculin skin tests convert from negative to strongly positive after ARV. These observations suggest that a paradoxical response associated with enhanced tuberculin skin reactivity may occur after the initiation of ARV in HIV-infected TB patients. Furthermore, the skin test conversion after the initiation of ARV may have important public health implications."
1888,0.005,1.0000,"The regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and replication in primary monocytes was investigated by mutagenesis of recombinant proviral clones containing an env determinant required for the infectivity of monocytes. Virus replication was assayed by determination of reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids and by recovery of virus from monocytes following cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, silent infection, and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or vpu genes generated lower replication levels in monocytes. Mutation of both vpr and vpu, however, resulted in nearly complete attenuation of virus replication in monocytes, despite subsequent virus recovery from infected monocytes by cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (silent infection). These findings indicate a central role for the ""accessory"" genes vpu and vpr in productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in monocytes and indicate that vpu and vpr may be capable of functional complementation."

Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "
4121,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has a significant impact on HIV-1 RNA levels, the CD4 cell count, and immune activation. We examined whether these changes are associated with a change in the rate of tryptophan degradation (expressed as the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, kyn/trp) as an estimate for the activity of interferon-gamma inducible enzyme indoleamine (, )-dioxygenase (IDO). Plasma levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, and neopterin were measured pretherapy and 6 months postinitiation of therapy in 45 patients with HIV-1 RNA levels of less than 1000 copies/ml 6 months after initiation of ART. Before ART, the patients had decreased tryptophan and increased kynurenine concentrations compared to healthy controls. During ART, average tryptophan levels increased; in the same time kynurenine and kyn/trp decreased (P < 0.001), although not to normal levels. Since pretherapy tryptophan concentrations correlated inversely with neopterin, and kynurenine correlated with viral load and neopterin but not with CD4 cell count, the data support the view that HIV production may induce immune activation and consequently tryptophan is degraded at a higher rate. In agreement, kyn/trp positively correlated with neopterin (r(s) = 0.60, P < 0.001), with virus load (r(s) = 0.37, P = 0.013), and very weakly with CD4(+) cells counts (r(s) = 0.30, P = 0.049). The change in the kyn/trp ratio during ART correlated more strongly with the change in neopterin levels (r(s) = 0.49, P = 0.001) than with the change in HIV RNA levels and weakly with the CD4 cell count. The data underscore the fact that both neopterin production and tryptophan degradation are triggered by immune activation. Tryptophan degradation is increased in HIV infection and partially reversed under ART. The data agree with the concept that immune activation is the common background of IDO activation which may be an important factor underlying T-cell hyporesponsiveness."
6919,0.005,1.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
7368,0.005,1.0000,"Eight patients with infection due to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 developed fat pads at the bases of their necks a median of 22 weeks (range, 4-61 weeks) after initiation of protease inhibitor therapy. This finding was seen in association with the use of each of the available protease inhibitors. The patients had no other cushingoid features or histories of corticosteroid use, and all had normal 24-hour urine cortisol levels. The computed tomography scans of five patients showed large, nonencapsulated accumulations of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Histological examination of tissue from one patient confirmed a nonlipomatous subcutaneous fat deposition. Although the pathogenesis of this unique clinical finding is unclear, the temporal relationship between the use of protease inhibitors and the development of cervical fat pads is suggestive of a complication of therapy."
9768,0.005,1.0000,"Four HHV-6 strains were initially isolated during attempts to observe HIV-1 replication in cultured primary lymphocytes from 48 patients with AIDS. HHV-6 DNA from each strain was extracted from primary cell cultures and amplified using specific primers in a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. All HHV-6 strains were classified as B variants by submitting the PCR products to the digestion of two restriction enzymes (Hind III and Bgl II). Since in primary cultures, the appearance of HHV-6 cytopathic effect was followed by a progressive reduction of HIV-1 replication, we tried to reproduce the observed inhibition in vitro. Two HHV-6 strains, used throughout the experiments, showed their ability to suppress HIV-1 replication when the viruses co-infected CD4+T lymphocyte cultures. While the intrinsic mechanism of this finding still remains unclear, the inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed only when a high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of HHV-6 and a low m.o.i. of HIV-1 were used in dually infected cell cultures. By using a semiquantitative determination of HIV-1 cDNA by PCR, it appears that the inhibition begins in infected cell cultures and, once established, does not allow any further HIV-1 replication."

HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
5965,0.005,1.0000,"Elite controllers represent a unique group of HIV-1-infected persons with undetectable HIV-1 replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. However, the mechanisms contributing to effective viral immune defense in these patients remain unclear. Here, we show that compared with HIV-1 progressors and HIV-1-negative persons, CD4+ T cells from elite controllers are less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This partial resistance to HIV-1 infection involved less effective reverse transcription and mRNA transcription from proviral DNA and was associated with strong and selective upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (also known as cip-1 and waf-1). Experimental blockade of p21 in CD4+ T cells from elite controllers resulted in a marked increase of viral reverse transcripts and mRNA production and led to higher enzymatic activities of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), which serves as a transcriptional coactivator of HIV-1 gene expression. This suggests that p21 acts as a barrier against HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells from elite controllers by inhibiting a cyclin-dependent kinase required for effective HIV-1 replication. These data demonstrate a mechanism of host resistance to HIV-1 in elite controllers and may open novel perspectives for clinical strategies to prevent or treat HIV-1 infection."
8122,0.005,1.0000,"This research describes major stressors in the lives of women who have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirty-one HIV antibody positive (HIV+) women infected primarily through heterosexual contact participated in a two hour semi-structured interview detailing the circumstances, context, and consequences of all stressful life events and difficulties experienced within the preceding six months. Qualitative methods of data analyses were utilized (Miles & Huberman, 1984). HIV-related life events and difficulties were classified into primary and secondary stressors based on the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1981). Problems arising directly from one's seropositivity were defined as primary stressors. Stressful life events and difficulties occurring in other role areas were defined as secondary stressors. Six categories of HIV-related stressors were identified and quantified. Primary stressors were health-related, and included both gynecological problems (e.g., amenorrhea) and general symptoms of HIV infection (e.g., fatigue). Secondary stressors related to child and family (e.g., future guardianship of children), marital/partner relations (e.g., disclosure of HIV+ status), occupation (e.g., arranging time-off for medical appointments), economic problems (e.g., insurance ""hassles""), and social network events (e.g., death of friends from AIDS). This research indicates that HIV-positive women are exposed to multiple stressors; some may be viewed as unique to women, whereas others may be considered common to both sexes. Identification of stressors has implications for the design of medical and psychiatric interventions for women."

In all cases, the introduction of tenofovir led to a sustained undetectable HBV and HIV loads, with marked clinical and laboratory improvement in liver function. We provide supporting evidence for the role of tenofovir in the management of advanced HBV infection in HIV-positive patients after the development of lamivudine resistance."
9226,0.005,1.0000,"A heterosexual partner study was carried out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 1990 to December 1991. The main objectives were to determine the rate of male-to-female transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to determine risk factors. Male index cases were recruited according to the following criteria: 1) confirmed HIV positivity, 2) 18 years old or older; 3) heterosexual contact within the past year. Only female partners who reported not to have other risk factors but to have had sexual contact with the index case were invited to participate. Couples were interviewed for risk factors and had blood collected for laboratory studies. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 45 percent among 204 female partners in the study. Using logistic regression, the authors found the following factors to be independently (p < 0.05) associated with HIV infection: 1) anal sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-7.45); 2) condom use during vaginal sex sometimes (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96), rarely (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.83), or never (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.23-7.50) as compared with always; 3) frequency of sexual contacts in the year prior to interview (100+) (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.91); and 4) oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 0.97-4.29). In addition to a borderline significance of oral contraceptive use, there was a strong suggestion of an interaction with history of sexually transmitted diseases."
3009,0.005,1.0000,"Viral replication of HIV-1 in the human body is a dynamic process. Incomplete suppression of replication during antiretroviral therapy ultimately selects for resistance that imparts an adaptive advantage to HIV-1. Therefore, the goal of antiretroviral therapy is complete suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression to below the lowest possible limits of detection has been associated with an optimal clinical response and delay of drug resistance. An ultrasensitive viral load assay with a very low threshold of detection remains our best laboratory tool to monitor the response to therapy. Patients may fail HAART for many reasons. Only when other potential causes of treatment failure are excluded should antiretroviral resistance testing be considered. Genotypic and phenotypic assays for assessing resistance are now available, and recent retrospective and prospective data support their use in clinical management as an adjunct to helping to choose among different antiretroviral drugs. Despite the growing enthusiasm for these tests, improvements in sensitivity, turnaround time, and quality control are still needed. A practitioner's decision about when to initiate or change therapy in an HIV-infected patient should depend primarily on viral load results, and not on antiretroviral resistance test results. Moreover, resistance testing is no substitute for a thorough clinical and drug history. As we approach the third decade of the HIV epidemic, we will learn how to use antiretroviral resistance tests in conjunction with (not in lieu of) proven clinical and laboratory tools."
5014,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 drug-resistance testing is quickly moving from the research laboratory to the clinic as data defining its utility as a prognostic indicator of response to therapy become available. In July 1998, a panel of the International AIDS Society-USA did not recommend the widespread application of resistance testing, but by May 2000 this panel endorsed and recommended the incorporation of resistance testing in patient-care management. Considerable data supporting the use of drug-resistance testing have now been published or presented at international conferences. These data strongly suggest that drug-resistance testing is of considerable value in many clinical settings. Prospective trials of resistance testing as a clinical management tool are still ongoing, and the long-term benefits still need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, early results from several studies showed a significantly better virological response when treatment regimens were based on resistance-testing data, rather than on the standard of care. HIV drug-resistance testing is also useful as a tool for new antiretroviral drug design and development, as well as for monitoring the spread of primary HIV drug resistance."
784,0.005,1.0000,"Heterosexual contact is the primary mode of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) transmission worldwide. The chemokine receptor CCR5 is the major coreceptor that is associated with the mucosal transmission of R5-tropic HIV-1 during sexual intercourse. The CCR5 molecule is thus a target for antibody-based therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking HIV-1 entry into cells. We have previously demonstrated that polyreactive natural antibodies (NAbs) from therapeutic preparations of immunoglobulin G and from human breast milk contain NAbs directed against CCR5. Such antibodies inhibit the infection of human macrophages and T lymphocytes by R5-tropic isolates of HIV in vitro. In the present study, we demonstrate that human immunoglobulins from the cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-seronegative or HIV-seropositive women contain NAbs directed against the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5. Natural affinity-purified anti-CCR5 antibodies bound to CCR5 expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells and further inhibited the infection of macrophages and dendritic cells with primary and laboratory-adapted R5-tropic HIV but not with X4-tropic HIV. Natural anti-CCR5 antibodies moderately inhibited R5-tropic HIV transfer from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to autologous T cells. Our results suggest that mucosal anti-CCR5 antibodies from healthy immunocompetent donors may hamper the penetration of HIV and may be suitable for use in the development of novel passive immunotherapy regimens in specific clinical settings of HIV infection."
9390,0.005,1.0000,"Correlates of resistance to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are important for defining potential therapeutic interventions and for prophylactic vaccination. In this study, 11 couples discordant in their HIV-1 infection status were prospectively evaluated for the presence of protective factors. Behavioral characteristics of all subjects entailed a high risk of transmission. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viruses isolated from the infected partner, and against laboratory virus isolates, were detected in 5 (45%) of 11 HIV-negative partners, including a CCR5Delta32-homozygous and a heterozygous subject. No CTL responses were observed in 6 control unexposed subjects. Marked variation in lymphocyte susceptibility to viral infection was noted. Resistance attributable to major histocompatibility complex discordance or anti-major histocompatibility complex antibodies was not identified. These results suggest that a combination of factors, including cellular immunity, viral characteristics, and coreceptor integrity, may be involved in the persistent nontransmission of HIV."
4422,0.005,1.0000,"Although the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has become a chronic illness, disease-specific advance care planning has not yet been evaluated for the palliative care needs of adults with HIV/AIDS. This prospective, longitudinal, randomized, two-arm controlled clinical trial aims to test the efficacy of FAmily CEntered advance care planning among adults living with AIDS and/or HIV with co-morbidities on congruence in treatment preferences, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. The FAmily CEntered intervention arm is two face-to-face sessions with a trained, certified facilitator: Session 1) Disease-Specific Advance Care Planning Respecting Choices Interview; Session 2) Completion of advance directive. The Healthy Living Control arm is: Session 1) Developmental/Relationship History; Session 2) Nutrition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. A total of 288 patient/surrogate dyads will be enrolled from five hospital-based, out-patient clinics in Washington, District of Columbia. Participants will be HIV positive and ≥ 21 years of age; surrogates will be ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives. If proposed aims are achieved, the benefits of palliative care, particularly increased treatment preferences about end-of-life care and enhanced quality of life, will be extended to people living with AIDS."

We retrospectively studied 252 cases of acute hepatitis B (AHB) admitted in our hospital between 2003-2005; 12 of them (4.76%) had a co-infection with hepatitis D virus. Most of the patients were young males with an urban origin. The route of transmission was unknown in 8/12 cases. Abdominal pain was more frequent during the onset of the disease than in AHB (p < 0.05). A cholestatic pattern was noted in 9 cases. The frequency of severe/ fulminant cases was greater then in AHB. The HBsAg was absent in 3 patients, and the HBV-DNA was present at low levels in 3/12 patients tested. Two patients had HBsAg present 6 month later."
122,0.005,1.0000,"All-oral direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus, which have response rates of 95% or more, represent a major clinical advance. However, the high list price of DAAs has led many governments to restrict their reimbursement. We reviewed the availability of, and national criteria for, interferon-free DAA reimbursement among countries in the European Union and European Economic Area, and Switzerland. Reimbursement documentation was reviewed between Nov 18, 2016, and Aug 1, 2017. Primary outcomes were fibrosis stage, drug or alcohol use, prescriber type, and HIV co-infection restrictions. Among the 35 European countries and jurisdictions included, the most commonly reimbursed DAA was ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir, with dasabuvir, and with or without ribavirin (33 [94%] countries and jurisdictions). 16 (46%) countries and jurisdictions required patients to have fibrosis at stage F2 or higher, 29 (83%) had no listed restrictions based on drug or alcohol use, 33 (94%) required a specialist prescriber, and 34 (97%) had no additional restrictions for people co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus. These findings have implications for meeting WHO targets, with evidence of some countries not following the 2016 hepatitis C virus treatment guidelines by the European Association for the Study of Liver."
3351,0.005,1.0000,"Of the 33 million people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide, 40-60% of individuals will eventually develop neurocognitive sequelae that can be attributed to the presence of HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS) and its associated neuroinflammation despite antiretroviral therapy. PrP(C) (protease resistant protein, cellular isoform) is the nonpathological cellular isoform of the human prion protein that participates in many physiological processes that are disrupted during HIV-1 infection. However, its role in HIV-1 CNS disease is unknown. We demonstrate that PrP(C) is significantly increased in both the CNS of HIV-1-infected individuals with neurocognitive impairment and in SIV-infected macaques with encephalitis. PrP(C) is released into the cerebrospinal fluid, and its levels correlate with CNS compromise, suggesting it is a biomarker of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment. We show that the chemokine (c-c Motif) Ligand-2 (CCL2) increases PrP(C) release from CNS cells, while HIV-1 infection alters PrP(C) release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Soluble PrP(C) mediates neuroinflammation by inducing astrocyte production of both CCL2 and interleukin 6. This report presents the first evidence that PrP(C) dysregulation occurs in cognitively impaired HIV-1-infected individuals and that PrP(C) participates in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated CNS disease."
1222,0.005,1.0000,"Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is classified into the family of Retroviridae and preferentially causes a chronic infection of CD4+ T cells. Most people infected with HTLV-1 remain asymptomatic. However, less than 105 of infected individuals eventually develop any of the associated severe diseases such as inflammatory syndromes, neoplastic diseases and opportunistic infections including Strongyloides stercoralis and Sarcoptes scabiei hyperinfections. Recently, it has been described that a weak Th2 cell-mediated response is associated with HTLV-1 infection and Strongyloides hyperinfection. The evaluation for HTLV-1 in all Norwegian scabies and S. stercoralis hyperinfection cases is highly recommended, especially when no other risk factors are apparent, in order to start a specific therapy against these parasite-virus coinfections."
5584,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C recurrence is the main cause of graft loss in liver transplant patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HII). These patients have higher risk of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, which is the most severe type of hepatitis C recurrence. Until direct antiviral agents were released, only a minority of patients could be satisfactorily treated. We describe the successful treatment with pegylated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir of an hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV co-infected patient who developed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis after liver transplantation. A 40-year- old male (HCV genotype 1a; IL-28 CC) underwent liver transplantation for decompensated cirrhosis. On post-transplant day 60, he rapidly developed progressive jaundice, worsening of liver function tests and ascites. A transjugular liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Treatment with peglated-interferon, ribavirin and telaprevir was indicated for 48 weeks, achieving sustained virological response at 12 weeks of follow-up. The rapid negativization of the viral load observed during the first 4 weeks of treatment was associated with regression of ascites andjaundice. Red blood cell transfusions, erythropoietin and filgrastim were required for the management of anemia and neutropenia. Triple therapy with telaprevir might be indicated for the treatment of severe HCV recurrence in selected HCV/HIV co-infected patients, especially in countries with limited access to pegylated-interferon-free regimens."
9162,0.005,1.0000,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
666,0.005,1.0000,"El Salvador harbours one of the largest Central American human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics, but few studies have analysed it in depth. Here, we describe the presence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and HIV variants in the HIV-infected adult population in El Salvador. Dried blood spots from 119 HIV-infected antiretroviral-naive adults attended in El Salvador were collected in 2011. The TDR was assessed according to the list recommended by the WHO. HIV-1 variants were described using phylogeny. Pol sequences could be amplified in 88 patients (50.6% men), with a mean age of 35 years. Almost all (96.7%) were infected with HIV through sexual practice and 58.7% were recently diagnosed. The mean CD4(+) count was 474 cells/mm(3) and 43.1% and 15.5% of patients showed moderate (<500 CD4 cells) or severe (<200) immune suppression, respectively. HIV-1 viral load was >100 000 copies/mL in 24.7% of patients and <2000 copies/mL in 9.1%. Five samples (5.7%) harboured any TDR mutation: 2.3% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and 1.4% for protease inhibitor (PI). All showed only one TDR single-class resistance mutation: M184I (two cases) for NRTI, K101E and K103N for NNRTI and L23I for PI. All viruses excepting one (URF_BG) belonged to subtype B. No phylogenetic TDR networks were found. In conclusion, we report a TDR prevalence of 5.7% in El Salvador, lower than in other Central American studies. Periodical studies are essential to monitor and prevent TDR emergence in low-income and middle-income regions. Also, more efforts are needed to promote early diagnosis and prevention of infection in El Salvador."
8433,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."

The present study describes the HPV prevalence in urine samples of 243 HIV-infected men and a control group of 231 men. HPV DNA was amplified by the SPF10 polymerase chain reaction primer set. The overall HPV prevalence in HIV-infected men was 27.5% compared with 12.6% in controls (P < 0.01). Infections with high-risk and multiple HPV genotypes were present in both groups. Differences were not statistically significant. A multivariate logistic regression model showed a decreased HPV prevalence associated with use of a nucleoside and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor combination (P = 0.03). A trend was observed towards a higher HPV prevalence and a lower CD4 cell count. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the role of HPV DNA testing in urine in future screening programmes for anal cancer in men."
42,0.005,1.0000,"In order to determine phenotypic protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated resistance in HIV subtype C virus, we have synthetically constructed an HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) viral backbone for use in a recombinant virus assay. The in silico designed viral genome was divided into 4 fragments, which were chemically synthesized and joined together by conventional subcloning. Subsequently, gag-protease-reverse-transcriptase (GPRT) fragments from 8 HIV-1 subtype C-infected patient samples were RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into the HIV-1-C backbone (deleted for GPRT) using In-Fusion reagents. Recombinant viruses (1 to 5 per patient sample) were produced in MT4-eGFP cells where cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE), p24 and Viral Load (VL) were monitored. The resulting HIV-1-C recombinant virus stocks (RVS) were added to MT4-eGFP cells in the presence of serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs (PI, NNRTI, NRTI) to determine the fold-change in IC50 compared to the IC50 of wild-type HIV-1 virus. Additionally, viral RNA was extracted from the HIV-1-C RVS and the amplified GPRT products were used to generate recombinant virus in a subtype B backbone. Phenotypic resistance profiles in a subtype B and subtype C backbone were compared. The following observations were made: i) functional, infectious HIV-1 subtype C viruses were generated, confirmed by VL and p24 measurements; ii) their rate of infection was slower than viruses generated in the subtype B backbone; iii) they did not produce clear CPE in MT4 cells; and iv) drug resistance profiles generated in both backbones were very similar, including re-sensitizing effects like M184V on AZT."
4731,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy has greatly reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality; however, its widespread use has been associated with a marked rise in the frequency of cardiovascular diseases in patients with HIV. Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."

Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
2383,0.005,1.0000,"We review studies examining the quality and quantity of social relationships as potential risk factors for differential progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several well-conducted prospective studies suggest that the health effects associated with the presence of supportive social relationships vary according to disease stage and mode of transmission. For gay or bisexual males in the early stages of infection, the presence of supportive social relationships appears to be a risk factor for accelerated disease progression. For individuals in the later stages of infection and those who acquire HIV via intravenous drug use or transfusion, supportive social relationships appear to be associated with health protective effects similar to those observed in other disease settings. We consider a variety of potential explanations for accelerated disease progression in gay men with extensive networks of personal relationships."

8960,0.005,1.0000,"Serum or liver markers of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection were found in 20 of 22 (90%) Italian patients presenting with an ostensible type B hepatitis that ran an accelerated course to cirrhosis. The features of the illness conformed to a syndrome of HDV infection in young males carrying the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg); a latent HBsAg state was documented in many patients by a history of prior exposure to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or by the absence of IgM antibodies to the HB core antigen. Characteristic of the disease were the clinical overture as a severe hepatitis, the lobular involvement by an extensive necroinflammatory reaction, the exuberant expression of intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen and an atypical HBV profile of inactive infection or accelerated seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe. Superimposed upon HBV infection, HDV may create a rapidly progressive course which resembles very aggressive hepatitis B but is infrequently observed in hepatitis B alone."

Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
9545,0.005,1.0000,"Inmate populations bear a disproportionate share of the burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. With more than 90% of prisoners released back to their communities within a few years of sentencing, incarceration can be viewed as an opportunity to provide HCV screening and therapeutic interventions to benefit the individual, reduce the costs of HCV management to the health care system from a societal perspective, and improve overall public health. Although optimal medical management of HCV within prison settings would increase the current cost of correctional health care, it could decrease transmission within the community, reduce overall disease burden, and lower the future societal health care costs associated with end-stage liver disease. Nonetheless, most prison systems treat only a small fraction of infected inmates. Current and emerging therapeutic agents will cure HCV infection in the vast majority of patients. Mathematical modeling also shows that expanded HCV screening and treatment are cost-effective from the societal perspective. In this article, we will describe appropriate treatment regimens, propose strategies to lessen the burden of these costly HCV therapies on correctional health care systems, and address the challenges of expanded HCV screening in correctional settings."

The overall prevalence of anti-HBc among outpatients remained almost unchanged and was 5.7% in 1979 and 5.4% in 1987. In 1987 the prevalence rate in outpatients increased significantly from 0% in persons less than 20 years to 9.8% in persons greater than 60 years (p = 0.008). Among hospital personnel tested in 1987 the prevalence rate also increased significantly with age from 4% in those 20-29 years of age to 26% in those greater than 60 years (p = 0.024). A significant increase of the prevalence rate with years of employment was, however, not found. Laboratory technicians with frequent blood contacts had a significantly higher prevalence rate than other health care workers and outpatients tested in 1987 (p less than 0.001). Laboratory technicians had an annual attack rate of HBV infection of 1.4% from 1979 to 1987. The results indicate that the prevalence of HBV infection in 1979 and 1987 has remained unchanged in the general population and that hospital personnel exposed to blood are at increased risk of getting HBV infection."

In this paper we aim to present the general socio-demographic profile and the clinical and therapeutic spectrum of patients with HIV infection who have visited the Bayamón Health Care facilities over the last 12 years and who are part of the Retrovirus Research Center (RRC). The objectives of the study are: 1) describe changes in the demographic, risk factors and clinical stage of patients with HIV infection initially seen in our center; 2) assess changing trends from the clinical and immunological perspective across time; 3) describe mortality risk of patients particularly after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a cross-sectional study of 3,569 patients admitted to the RRC at the Universidad Central del Caribe between years 1992 through 2005. The variables studied were demographic, risk factors exposure, HIV status at baseline, clinical and immunological parameters, ART and the mortality risk. Chi square with Cramer's coefficient, Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis were performed. The study revealed that individuals presenting at our health care facilities are older and that the proportion of females has increased. The risk factor profile shows increase in heterosexual contact with the disease. The study found that patients treated with ART had significantly lower mortality risk than those without ART. Patients who arrive to RRC with AIDS and Intravenous Drug Users (IDU) had a higher mortality risk than participants with HIV. The analysis of the trends showed changes in the demographic and clinical profile of patients across the years. HIV/AIDS prevention programs and policies need to be continued in Puerto Rico in order to better control the spread of the epidemic."
461,0.005,1.0000,"General practitioners will have an increasingly important role in the management of patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the numbers of cases increase. Altogether 280 general practitioners working in Oxfordshire were sent a postal questionnaire inquiring about their education, knowledge, current practice, and attitudes in relation to managing infections with HIV. Of the 235 (84%) general practitioners who replied, nine out of 10 were giving advice about infection with HIV to their patients. One in two were testing patients for such infection, and one in four were caring for infected patients. Nevertheless, uncertainty remained about the risks of transmission of infection with HIV and general practitioners' knowledge of educational activities for their patients could be improved. The introduction of a facilitator to work with general practitioners in managing patients with AIDS or infection with HIV is planned, especially to help general practitioners develop the skills needed for prevention."
458,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to increase the risk of death from severe liver disease and, because HCV status is strongly associated with a history of injecting drug use, the effect of a key disease progression cofactor, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is of interest. We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."
3179,0.005,1.0000,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."
1693,0.005,1.0000,"Depression is one of the main psychiatric co-morbidities in HIV infection, presenting with a significantly higher prevalence than in the general population (around 35%). Its presence has been associated with poor quality of life, HIV disease progression and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Although antidepressive treatment has demonstrated effectiveness on the management of depressive symptoms, improvement of clinical and laboratory parameters, and enhancement of antiretroviral adherence, depression is frequently under diagnosed and under treated in these patients. We analyzed the main international findings on depression prevalence, risk factors, con-sequences and management in people with HIV disease."

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."

We undertook a survey at two sites in North Arcot district of Tamil Nadu in 1992-1993, to know the seroprevalence of HIV infection among tuberculosis patients. The objective of this study was to re-examine the prevalence of HIV infection among tuberculosis patients in a repeat survey."
9511,0.005,1.0000,"Asian Americans are disproportionately affected by hepatitis B (HBV) infection. In the USA, one in ten Asian Americans is infected with HBV. The purpose of the study was to explore knowledge, fears and follow-up care among Asian Americans chronically infected with hepatitis B. A sample of 154 completed an online survey which included demographic information, follow-up treatment information, and HBV knowledge and fears/concerns. Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

4870,0.005,1.0000,"This paper describes the AACTG Adherence Instruments, which are comprised of two self-report questionnaires for use in clinical trials conducted by the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG). The questionnaires were administered to 75 patients at ten AACTG sites in the USA. All patients were taking combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), including at least one protease inhibitor. Eleven per cent of patients reported missing at least one dose the day before the interview, and 17% reported missing at least one dose during the two days prior. The most common reasons for missing medications included 'simply forgot' (66%) and a number of factors often associated with improved health, including being busy (53%), away from home (57%) and changes in routine (51%). Less adherent patients reported lower adherence self-efficacy (p = 0.006) and were less sure of the link between non-adherence and the development of drug resistance (p = 0.009). They were also more likely to consume alcohol, to be employed outside the home for pay and to have enrolled in clinical trials to gain access to drugs (all p < 0.05). Twenty-two per cent of patients taking drugs requiring special instructions were unaware of these instructions. Each questionnaire took approximately ten minutes to complete. Responses to the questionnaires were favourable. These questionnaires have been included in six AACTG clinical trials to date and have been widely disseminated to investigators both in the USA and abroad."
3183,0.005,1.0000,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
6195,0.005,1.0000,"To determine behavioural risk factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity among 1104 youth aged 15-24 years we conducted a cross-sectional survey in Moshi rural district in northern Tanzania. Information was obtained about sociodemographic characteristics as well as sexual and reproductive health behaviour. Anonymous blood samples were taken for HIV testing. Positive HIV antibodies were determined and confirmed by two Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA). Of 1104 youth interviewed, 91% (1003) consented for blood specimen taking. Seven out of ten youth volunteered to have had sexual intercourse at least once in their lifetime; 60% reported to consume alcohol and 50% of the sexually experienced females reported to have received a gift for their sexual encounter. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 7.5% (75/1003); females compared to males were twice as likely to be HIV positive, 9.7% and 5% respectively. Behavioural risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity were different in male compared to female youth. Among male subjects, cigarette smoking, ever use of marijuana and having a past history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were significant risk factors associated with increased risk of HIV seropositivity. On the other hand, in females, those with a past or current history of STDs, those who volunteered that they practiced oral sex and subjects with four or more lifetime sexual partners were more likely to be HIV positive than subjects without a history of an STD, those with single sexual partner or had never practiced oral sex. A four fold increased risk of HIV seropositivity was also observed among female subjects with a history of blood transfusion in the previous 10 years compared to having received none, the Odds ratio was 4.1 (95% CI = 1.5, 11.1). The profile of risk behaviour associated with HIV seropositivity calls for an urgent need to target health information and education interventions to bring about a change in behaviour among the youth and hopefully help to reduce the rate of transmission of HIV infection."
1004,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in gradual immunosuppression due to the loss of CD4+ T cells. In the wake of immune system breakdown, infected individuals may acquire multiple opportunistic infections and develop certain malignancies which ultimately account for the vast majority of deaths in these persons. A limited number of malignancies are directly associated with HIV infection and suggest a common tie between these tumors. Inappropriate immune surveillance resulting in insufficient inhibition of virus replication and inadequate control of the growth of transformed cells may contribute to the development of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals. Alternatively, malignancies in HIV infection may be the consequence of immune dysregulation. Cellular immune responses mediated by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of particular importance for immunologic control of viral infections and substantial information has been gathered about theses cells in HIV infection. The goal of this review is therefore to summarize recent findings regarding the cellular immune response to HIV with a particular focus on cytokines released by HIV-specific CTL."
9183,0.005,1.0000,"Globally, at least 60 million people have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the majority of whom will develop the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) leading to tremendous morbidity and the mortality. Understanding the immunopathogenesis of AIDS and the immune correlates of viral protection are necessary to develop effective vaccines and immunotherapies. A major focus of our laboratory has been to understand the CD4+ T cell immune response directed against HIV- 1, and to determine mechanisms of T cell dysfunction that lead to viral escape. In addition, we are interested in evaluating the TNF-TNFR family members as potential molecular adjuvants that could be incorporated into vaccines which could be used to further boost T cell immunogenicity in healthy or HIV-1-infected individuals, as many of these molecules have been shown to replace the functions of CD4+ T cell help."
7058,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleotide sequence variability studies were conducted on a 263-base pair fragment of the core-coding genomic region of hepatitis B virus (HBV), amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from three surgeons with varying circulating levels of HBV, all of whom were thought to have transmitted HBV to their patients post-surgically. DNA sequencing was applied to amplicons obtained directly from serum and those cloned into plasmid vectors, and from single HBV molecules in serum separated by a limiting dilution procedure. In one surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 3 x 10(5) genome equivalents ml-1, the direct sequence was identical to none of 29 other sequences and differed by one base substitution from the sequence amplified from the single patient he infected. In another surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 2 x 10(6) genome equivalents ml-1, the direct sequence was identical to 17 of 36 (47%) sequences; however, the sequence common to all three infected patients was identical to a unique sequence in the surgeon that differed by three base substitutions from the direct sequence. By contrast, the direct sequence in the third surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 4 x 10(7) genome equivalents ml-1, was identical to 25 of 38 (66%) sequences, and to the sequence common to all 11 infected patients. Assessment of HBV DNA sequences directly amplified from clinical specimens may not be appropriate to studies of transmission in which the source of infection harbours a relatively dilute, heterogeneous mix of viral variants."
1793,0.005,1.0000,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."
2171,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus infected persons are usually identified by indirect methods, detecting viral-specific antibodies. Helping the early diagnosis of HIV infection there is a need to detect virus or viral specific antigens directly. Virus isolation have been attempted from separated lymphocytes of HIV infected five homosexual male patients and one transfusion recipient. Three patients had AIDS, three belonged to the ARC group at the time of the examination. In 3 out of 6 lymphocyte cultures cocultivated with normal donor lymphocytes, virus antigens and virus replications had been detected within ten days of culture. The amount of HIV antigen p24 ranged between 0.5----2.0 ng/ml during the first two weeks of cocultivation. Permanent human lymphoid and monocyte/macrophage cell lines have been infected by the viruses isolated from the primer lymphocyte cocultures. Productive infection could be initiated in Jurkat tat-III and U937 cells, while infection of Jurkat and HUT 78 cell lines was transient. Results indicate, that HIVs could be isolated from infected Hungarian patients with various stages of AIDS and one isolate--termed HIV-1FB918--actively replicates in human permanent cell lines."
9238,0.005,1.0000,"Care of patients with HIV infection starts with diagnosis as soon as possible, preferably at or near the time of acute infection. Opportunistic infections, malignancies, and other conditions develop progressively over time, particularly in untreated patients. The AIDS-defining opportunistic infections most common in the United States include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Candida esophagitis, toxoplasmic encephalitis, tuberculosis, disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptococcal meningitis, and cytomegalovirus retinitis. Specific prophylaxis regimens exist for several opportunistic infections, and effective antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of most others. Other AIDS-defining conditions include wasting syndrome and HIV encephalopathy. AIDS-defining malignancies include Kaposi sarcoma, systemic non-Hodgkin lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and invasive cervical cancer. Although not an AIDS-defining condition, anal cancer is common in patients with HIV infection.

6184,0.005,1.0000,"For cancer patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy, HBV reactivation is a well-described complication, which may result in varying degrees of liver damage. Several clinical features and the pre-chemotherapy HBV viral load have been suggested to be associated with an increased risk of developing the condition: (1). to assess the clinical and virological factors in a comprehensive manner and thereby identify those that are associated with the development of HBV reactivation; (2). to develop a predictive model to quantify the risk of HBV reactivation. In all, 138 consecutive cancer patients who were HBV carriers and undergoing chemotherapy were studied, of which 128 patients had sera available for real-time PCR HBV DNA measurement. They were followed up throughout their course of chemotherapy and the HBV reactivation rate was determined. The clinical and virological features between those who did and did not develop viral reactivation were compared. These included age, sex, baseline liver function tests, HBeAg status and viral load (HBV DNA) prior to the chemotherapy, and the use of specific cytotoxic agents. In all, 36 (26%) developed HBV reactivation. Multivariate analysis revealed pre-chemotherapy HBV DNA level, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer to be significant factors. Based on real-time HBV DNA PCR assay, detectable baseline HBV DNA prior to the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of steroids and a diagnosis of lymphoma or breast cancer are predictive factors for the development of HBV reactivation. A predictive model was developed from the current data, based on a logistic regression method."
8903,0.005,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus infects the CNS and results in predictable pathophysiology strikingly similar to that seen with HIV-1 infection of humans. The observed pathophysiology is mimicked in several physiologically assessed modalities, further supporting the validity of the feline model. Peripheral and control evoked potential findings and the occurrence of the sleep architecture changes in both cat and human disease provide an intriguing focus for further investigation. Although structurally diverse in an absolute sense, FIV and HIV-1 share basic structural features and commonalities of their life cycle. It is likely that by understanding the common mechanisms by which these lentiviruses influence CNS function, a more complete understanding of the neurological deficits seen in HIV-1 infected patients will be obtained. The cat model is particularly valuable for study of CNS disease, since it allows detailed analyses of events during the acute phase of infection, under circumstances in which the nature and timing of the infection are carefully controlled. The availability of molecular clones for mutational analysis will facilitate mapping of genomic regions critical to the perturbation of CNS function. It is suggested that development of intervention strategies in the cat model will yield treatment modalities directly applicable to HIV-1 infection of humans."

9548,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses are defective in HIV-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART). This defect has been attributed to the decreased antigenic burden secondary to ART-associated suppression of HIV-replication, and is responsible for the rebounds of viraemia that occur when patients interrupt therapy. CTL are stimulated by type 1 cytokines and can kill targets via granule-dependent (perforin and granzymes) and -independent (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, CD95) mechanisms."
9367,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) canarypox vaccines are safe but poorly immunogenic. CD40 ligand (CD40L), a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF), is a pivotal costimulatory molecule for immune responses. To explore whether CD40L can be used as an adjuvant for HIV-1 canarypox vaccine, we constructed recombinant canarypox viruses expressing CD40L. Co-immunization of mice with CD40L expressing canarypox and the canarypox vaccine expressing HIV-1 proteins, vCP1452, augmented HIV-1 specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in terms of frequency, polyfunctionality and interleukin (IL)-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Ralpha, CD127) expression. In addition, CD40L expressed from canarypox virus could significantly augment CD4+ T cell responses against HIV-1 in mice. CD40L expressed from canarypox virus matured human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) in a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) independent manner, which underwent less apoptosis, and could expand ex vivo Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CTL responses from healthy human individuals and ex vivo HIV-1-specific CTL responses from HIV-1-infected individuals in the presence or absence of CD4+ T cells. Taken together, our results suggest that CD40L incorporation into poxvirus vectors could be used as a strategy to enhance their immunogenicity."

B lymphoblastoid cells infected with vaccinia virus vectors expressing HIV-1 gag gene products were combined with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells to detect circulating CTLs. Effector cells were defined by monoclonal antibody-mediated, complement-dependent cytolysis. Circulating HIV-1 gag-specific cytotoxic responses were detectable in 4 of 5 HIV-1-infected pediatric hemophilic patients, and were similar in magnitude to those previously described in adults. In contrast, circulating HIV-1 gag-specific cytolysis was detectible in only 3 of 12 vertically infected children. Depletion data revealed that the majority of detectible gag-specific cytolysis was CD8 T cell-mediated. No apparent relationships between CD4 T cell counts, CD8 T cells counts, or serum p24 antigen levels and CTL responses were seen. Deficient CTL development may, in part, explain the more rapid onset of symptomatic disease following vertical HIV infection."
1490,0.005,1.0000,"Although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8+ T cells can produce various cytokines that suppress HIV-1 replication or modulate anti-HIV-1 immunity, the extent to which HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells produce cytokines when they recognize HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells in vivo still remains unclear. We first analyzed the abilities of 10 cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones specific for three HIV-1 epitopes to produce gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha after stimulation with epitope peptide-pulsed cells. These CTL clones produced these cytokines in various combinations within the same specificity and among the different specificities, suggesting a functional heterogeneity of HIV-1-specific effector CD8+ T cells in cytokine production. In contrast, the HIV-1-specific CTL clones for the most part produced a single cytokine, without heterogeneity of cytokine production among the clones, after stimulation with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. The loss of heterogeneity in cytokine production may be explained by low surface expression of HLA class I-epitope peptide complexes. Freshly isolated HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells with an effector/memory or memory phenotype produced much more of the cytokines than the same epitope-specific CTL clones when stimulated with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. Cytokine production from HIV-1-specific memory/effector and memory CD8+ T cells might be a critical event in the eradication of HIV-1 in HIV-1-infected individuals."

Little is known of GH/IGF-1 axis alterations with antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation or differing ART therapies. The AIDS Clinical Trials Group Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource-Limited Settings (PEARLS) study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial of ART initiation with emtricitabine/tenofovir + efavirenz (FTC/TDF+EFV) versus lamivudine/zidovudine + efavirenz (3TC/ZDV+EFV) in HIV-1-infected individuals from resource-diverse settings. IGF-1 was measured from baseline, week 48, and week 96 stored serum samples. Multivariate models were constructed. 415 participants were included: 170 (41%) were randomized to FTC/TDF+EFV and 245 (59%) to 3TC/ZDV+EFV. The mean age was 35 years, 60% were black, 42% women. The mean IGF-1 level did not change significantly from baseline to week 96 (-0.65 ng/ml; 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.18-3.87), p = .78 and there were no differences by treatment arm at week 96, p = .74. Lower baseline IGF-1 was associated with age, non-white race, greater waist-hip ratio (WHR), low CD4 count, and lower baseline albumin (all p < .01) but not plasma HIV-1 RNA, body mass index, or treatment arm. Greater change in IGF-1 from baseline to 96 weeks was associated with female sex, smaller WHR change, lower baseline albumin, and higher baseline HIV-1 RNA (all p < .01). ART initiation with either ZDV or TDF did not significantly impact overall IGF-1 levels. Baseline and on-treatment changes in IGF-1 with ART initiation may be related to the body composition changes that occur after ART initiation."

We prospectively studied the evolution of anti-HBs after primary vaccination (3 doses; Engerix B, 40 mu g each) in 56 seronegative and not previously vaccinated hemodialysis patients. Three months after vaccine administration, seroconversion (anti-HBs > 10 IU/1) was found in 43 patients (76.7%), but an adequate response (titer > 100 IU/1) was observed only in 30 (53.5%). At 1 year after vaccination only 1 (3.3%) of the 30 cases with an effective response had lost his anti-HBs, while 12 of the 13 patients (92.3%) with an inadequate response (anti-HBs between 10 and 100 IU/1) had no detectable antibodies (p < 0.01, chi2). Considering that an antibody titer above 100 IU/1 following vaccination is necessary in order to maintain that level of antibody 1 year later, we analyzed the factors which influenced obtaining this level of antibody. Age, time on hemodialysis, serum albumin, Kt/V and protein catabolic rate did not affect the response to the vaccine. Females had a better response than males, and interestingly we found that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection influenced the level of immunity. 27 out of the 43 HCV-negative cases (62.7%) obtained anti-HBs levels greater than 100 IU/1, but only 3 out of the 13 HCV-infected patients (23%) had an anti-HBs above 100 IU/1 (p < 0.01, chi2). Our results suggest that after hepatitis B vaccine, an antibody titer higher than 100 IU/1 is necessary to maintain the antibody level 1 year later, and that HCV infection may reduce the effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccine in hemodialysis patients."
8539,0.005,1.0000,"Several new antiviral agents have recently been developed which can inhibit hepatitis B replication by at least two logs. Lamivudine is the most widely studied of these new agents. Extensive phase II and III studies in patients with chronic hepatitis B are in progress, or have been completed. The sustained HBeAg seroconversion rate in patients who have received 100 mg lamivudine rate increase from 17% at year one to 27% after 2 years. Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis. Both HBeAg and anti-HBe positive patients are benefited, as may be patients with cirrhosis."
9322,0.005,1.0000,"The spectrum of pulmonary manifestations in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is broad, including many infectious and noninfectious complications. In the evaluation of an HIV-infected patient with diffuse pulmonary disease a definitive diagnosis is preferred over empiric therapy in most patients. Patients with focal consolidation usually receive empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, with nonresponders undergoing additional diagnostic testing. Bronchoscopy remains a cornerstone in the diagnostic evaluation. A multilobar bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and avoids the additional complications of hemorrhage and pneumothorax associated with transbronchial biopsy (TBBX). However, TBBX improves the sensitivity for diagnosis of tuberculosis and fungal pneumonias and is necessary to confirm invasive aspergillosis. Definitive criteria for diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis have yet to be established, although bronchoscopic specimens usually are used. Tissue confirmation with TBBX is required for the diagnosis of noninfectious disorders such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocytic and nonspecific pneumonitis. Bronchoscopic visualization of typical lesions often is sufficient for the presumptive diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) although the diagnostic yield is enhanced by the detection of human herpes virus 8 in BAL samples."
6204,0.005,1.0000,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
3843,0.005,1.0000,"Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause of dyspnoea in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients. The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."
9539,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophages are early targets of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and serve as potential reservoirs for long-term infection. Through inflammatory mediators and direct cell contact, infected macrophages interact with neighboring cell populations, such as the endothelium, which create a microenvironment favorable for HIV-1 replication. We hypothesize that the transcriptional activator C/EBPbeta is critical for macrophages to respond to endothelial cell-derived signals. We show that endothelial cells significantly enhance C/EBPbeta binding activity and HIV-1 replication in macrophages. This increase in HIV-1 transcription is due to cell-cell contact as well as the production of soluble factors, mediated in part by ICAM-1 and interleukin 6, respectively. Furthermore, C/EBP factors are necessary for endothelial cell-dependent activation of HIV-1 transcription in macrophages, and HIV-1 induction can be inhibited by a C/EBP dominant-negative protein. In addition, C/EBP binding sites are necessary for efficient LTR activity and HIV-1 replication in the presence of endothelial cells. Taken together, these results indicate that endothelial cells, through the activation of C/EBPbeta, provide a microenvironment that supports HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages."
2026,0.005,1.0000,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."
1208,0.005,1.0000,"The high levels of genetic diversity shown by hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly attributed to the low fidelity of its polymerase. However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV in vivo is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "
59,0.005,1.0000,"The large rep gene products, Rep78 and Rep68, of adeno-associated virus (AAV) are pleiotropic effector proteins which are required for AAV DNA replication and the trans-regulation of AAV gene expression. Apart from these essential functions prerequisite for the life cycle of AAV, these rep products are able to inhibit the replication and gene expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a number of DNA viruses. Here, it is demonstrated that Rep78, as a chimeric with the maltose binding protein, directly binds the full-length HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and to a subset of these sequences containing the trans-activation response (TAR) sequence as DNA. These interactions, an effector protein physically binding a target promoter, suggest a direct mechanism of action for Rep78 inhibition. Furthermore, competitive binding studies between the TAR region and the full-length HIV-LTR, strongly suggested that another site(s) within the LTR was also bound by Rep78. Finally, as Rep78 binding is also believed to be affected by secondary structure within the DNA, it was found that Rep78 preferentially binds with HIV-LTR sequences with promoted secondary structure generated by heat denaturation and rapid cooling."
8390,0.005,1.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."
7126,0.005,1.0000,"Understanding the genetic, antigenic and structural changes that occur during HIV-1 infection in response to pre-existing immunity will facilitate current efforts to develop an HIV-1 vaccine. Much is known about HIV-1 variation at the population level but little with regard to specific changes occurring in the envelope glycoprotein within a host in response to immune pressure elicited by antibodies. The aim of this study was to track and map specific early genetic changes occurring in the viral envelope gene following vaccination using a highly controlled viral challenge setting in the SHIV macaque model. We generated 449 full-length env sequences from vaccinees, and 63 from the virus inoculum. Analysis revealed a different pattern in the distribution and frequency of mutations in the regions of the envelope gene targeted by the vaccine as well as different patterns of diversification between animals in the naïve control group and vaccinees. Given the high stringency of the model it is remarkable that we were able to identify genetic changes associated with the vaccination. This work provides insight into the characterization of breakthrough viral populations in less than fully efficacious vaccines and illustrates the value of HIV-1 Env SHIV challenge model in macaques to unravel the mechanisms driving HIV-1 envelope genetic diversity in the presence of vaccine induced-responses.

6464,0.005,1.0000,We identified an unusual case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in a patient (GM43) who exhibited a persistently low antibody response and undetectable viral load during a 5-year follow-up period. GM43 harbored HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 01_AE with gross deletions in the nef/long terminal repeat (LTR) region. The sizes of the deletions increased progressively from 84 to >400 bp during the 5-year period. GM43 appeared to have acquired defective variants from her husband. The genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region were remarkably similar to those that have been reported in slow progressors (such as the slow progressors in the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort). The present study is the first report of slow disease progression due to gross genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region in a person infected with an HIV-1 non-subtype B strain.
8860,0.005,1.0000,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
3335,0.005,1.0000,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
7231,0.005,1.0000,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."

2132,0.005,1.0000,"Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to reflect the resolution of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patient characteristics and various seromarkers were evaluated to characterize factors predicting spontaneous HBsAg loss in a cohort of HBeAg-seronegative patients with presumed chronic HBV infection. Relationships between seromarkers and HBsAg loss were assessed annually and after 6 years using binary logistic regression. Among the 634 participants, 117 (18.45%) cleared HBsAg after 6 years, with a 3.08% annual seroclearance rate. Baseline HBsAg levels and platelet (PLT) counts were predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. The HBsAg level predicted HBsAg seroclearance better than the PLT count (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): HBsAg, 0.965 (95%CI, 0.947-0.980) versus PLT count, 0.617 (95%CI, 0.561-0.669); P < 0.001). A cutoff HBsAg level of 10 IU/ml at baseline predicted spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance at 6 years with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 87.2%, a specificity of 94.8%, a positive predictive value of 79.1%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0%.

The rate of transmission of the virus to the infant is around 20%, and there remains much uncertainty concerning the exact mechanism involved. Early diagnostic methods are based on isolating the virus in culture or PCR but the sensitivity of this test is only 50% at birth, although rising to nearly 100% by 6 months of age. In the infant, the main characteristic of the disease is the existence of a subgroup (comprising 15 to 20% of the patients) that develops AIDS early, in association with opportunistic infection and encephalopathy in the first months of life. Treatment choices remain very limited, with the hope of eventual prevention of maternal-fetal transmission. The gravity of the ensuing psychological and social problems calls for a multidisciplinary approach to the infant, family and relatives."
6797,0.005,1.0000,"The immune mechanisms associated with the evolution from latent to clinically active mycobacterial coinfection in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans remain poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) can develop persistent Mycobacterium bovis BCG coinfection and a fatal SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease by 4 months after BCG inoculation. In the present study, SIVmac-infected monkeys that developed clinically quiescent mycobacterial infection after BCG inoculation were followed prospectively for the reactivation of the BCG and the development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease. The development of clinically latent BCG coinfection in these SIVmac-infected monkeys was characterized by a change from high to undetectable levels of bacterial organisms, with or without measurable BCG mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The reactivation of clinically latent BCG coinfection and development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease were then observed in these SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys during a 21-month period of follow-up. The reactivation of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease in these animals coincided with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells and a loss of BCG-specific T-cell responses. Interestingly, bacterial superantigen challenge of the SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys resulted in an up-regulation of clinically latent BCG coinfection, suggesting that infection with superantigen-producing microbes may increase the susceptibility of individuals to the reactivation of AIDS-related mycobacterial coinfection. Thus, reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in HIV-1-infected individuals may result from a loss of T-cell immunity or from a superimposed further compromise of the immune system."
2441,0.005,1.0000,"The association between risk behaviors and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been extensively studied. It is also proved that impulsivity is associated with risk behaviors. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between HCV and impulsivity, a characteristic that can contribute directly to these risk behaviors. This study aimed to investigate HCV-infected individuals' impulsivity and whether this feature mediates risk behavior. Adult patients with liver diseases (n=269) were divided into two groups: viral group (n=157) - patients with HCV and nonviral group (n=112). Risk behaviors were evaluated by a sociodemographic questionnaire. Impulsivity was assessed through Barratt Impulsiveness Scale - BIS-11. Psychiatric comorbidities were investigated by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 5.0.0. The viral group patients had higher impulsivity than the nonviral group in all domains: attentional impulsivity, motor impulsivity, and nonplanning. Risk behaviors were also shown to be associated with impulsivity levels. Our results suggest that HCV-infected patients are more impulsive than individuals with other liver diseases, even when analyses are controlled for the presence of comorbid mental disorders. In addition, at-risk behavior was significantly mediated by impulsivity."
9989,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."

A total of 296 patients with liver biopsy were randomly assigned to an estimation group (EG = 226; 70%) and a validation group (VG = 70; 30%). We developed the Hospital Gregorio Marañón (HGM)-1 index, based on platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and glucose, to predict F > or = 2 and the HGM-2 index, based on platelet count, international normalized ratio, alkaline phosphatase and AST to predict F > or = 3. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of the HGM-1 index for the EG and the VG were 0.807 and 0.712 respectively. The AUROCs of the HGM-2 index for the EG and the VG were 0.844 and 0.815 respectively. With the HGM-1 index applied to the VG, using best cutoff scores, the negative predictive value (NPV) to exclude F > or = 2 was 54.5% and the positive predictive value (PPV) to confirm F > or = 2 was 93.3%. With the HGM-2 index applied to the VG, using best cutoff scores, the NPV to exclude F > or = 3 was 92.3, and the PPV to confirm F > or = 3 was 64.3%.

In the present study, changes in certain virologic markers have been analyzed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue during antiretroviral therapy. Sixteen HIV-infected individuals who were receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine for > or = 6 months were randomly assigned either to continue on zidovudine alone or to add didanosine for 8 weeks. Lymph node biopsies were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Viral burden (i.e., HIV DNA copies per 10(6) mononuclear cells) and virus replication in mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and lymph node and plasma viremia were determined by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Virologic and immunologic markers remained unchanged in peripheral blood and lymph node of patients who continued on zidovudine alone. In contrast, a decrease in virus replication in lymph nodes was observed in four of six patients who added didanosine to their regimen, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma viremia. These results indicate that decreases in plasma viremia detected during antiretroviral therapy reflect downregulation of virus replication in lymphoid tissue."

We observed that two field variants, SLFNTVAVL and SVYNTVATL, of an A*0201-restricted Gag CTL epitope SLYNTVATL, and three field variants, KYRLKHLVW, QYRLKHIVW, and RYRLKHLVW, of an A24-restricted Gag CTL epitope KYKLKHIVW escaped from being killed by the CTL lines, despite the fact that they were recognized when the synthetic peptides corresponding to these variant sequences were exogenously loaded onto the target cells. Thus, their escape is likely due to the changes that occur during the processing and presentation of epitopes in the infected cells. Mutations responsible for this mode of escape were located within the epitope regions rather than the flanking regions, and such mutations did not influence the virus replication. The results suggest that the impaired antigen processing and presentation often occur in HIV-1 field isolates and thus are one of the major mechanisms that enable HIV-1 to escape from CTL recognition. We emphasize the importance of testing HIV-1 variants in an endogenous expression system."
2242,0.005,1.0000,"We have previously identified a VEINCTR peptide common to both the Fasmolecule and HIV-1 gp120. Here we report the characterization in PBMCs from HIV-1-infected individuals of a CD8+ class I restricted CTL activity directed towards this peptide. The peptide is highly conserved in various HIV-1 strains, being located at amino acid 287-293 (VEINCTR), within an epitope known as cell T epitope on the env protein of human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Cell cultures were obtained by polyclonal activation using autologous blast cells and CTL lines generated from frozen peripheral blood lymphocytes of HIV-1 seropositive donors by stimulation with the peptide and recombinant interleukin-2. The env-specific CTL turned out to kill autologous target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the env gene of HIV-1 or pulsed with peptide. Specificity was determined using shorter peptides. The CTL activity was directed against autologous target cells presenting the heptapeptide which is site located in the Fas molecule, known to be functionally involved in T-cell apoptosis."
6034,0.005,1.0000,"Major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to persistent virus infections. Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."
4808,0.005,1.0000,"Analysis of major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) capable of killing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected targets is essential for elucidating the basis for HIV-1 disease progression and the potential efficacy of candidate vaccines. The use of primary CD4+ T cells with variable infectivity as targets for such studies has significant limitations, and immortal autologous cells with high levels of CD4 expression that can be consistently infected with HIV-1 would be of much greater utility. Therefore, we transduced Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) with a retroviral vector, LT4SN, containing the human CD4 gene. Stable LCL in which more than 95% of cells expressed membrane CD4 were obtained. Aliquots were infected with HIV-1, and, after 4 to 7 days, nearly all of the cells contained cytoplasmic gag and produced high levels of p24 antigen. The ability of major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ CTL to lyse such HIV-1-infected CD4-transduced LCL (LCL-CD4HIV-1) was evaluated. These autologous targets were lysed by CTL generated from an HIV-1-uninfected vaccinee over a broad range of effector-to-target ratios. Similarly, the LCL-CD4HIV-1 were efficiently lysed by fresh circulating CTL from HIV-1-infected individuals, as well as by CTL activated by in vitro stimulation. Both HIV-1 env- and gag-specific CTL effectors lysed LCL-CD4HIV-1, consistent with the cellular expression of both HIV-1 genes. The LCL-CD4HIV also functioned as stimulator cells, and thus are capable of amplifying CTL against multiple HIV-1 gene products in HIV-1-infected individuals. The ability to produce HIV-1-susceptible autologous immortalized cell lines that can be employed as target cells should enable a more detailed evaluation of vaccine-induced CTL against both homologous and disparate HIV-1 strains. Furthermore, the use of LCL-CD4HIV-1 should facilitate the analysis of the range of HIV-1 gene products recognized by CTL in seropositive persons."
3885,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef downregulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), impairing the clearance of infected cells by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). While sequence motifs mediating this function have been determined by in vitro mutagenesis studies of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 molecular clones, it is unclear whether the highly variable Nef sequences of primary isolates in vivo rely on the same sequence motifs. To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically HIV-1-infected persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered MHC-I downregulatory function under Gag-specific CTL immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with MHC-I downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations (A84D, Y135F, and G140R) that ablated MHC-I downregulation and 3 (N52A, S169I, and V180E) that partially impaired MHC-I downregulation. Globally, the CTL pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked MHC-I downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that CTL pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for MHC-I downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo."
2192,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
9977,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1 infected infants experience poor viral containment and rapid disease progression compared to adults. Viral factors (e.g. transmitted cytotoxic T- lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations) or infant factors (e.g. reduced CTL functional capacity) may explain this observation. We assessed CTL functionality by analysing selection in CTL-targeted HIV-1 epitopes following perinatal infection. HIV-1 gag, pol and nef sequences were generated from a historical repository of longitudinal specimens from 19 vertically infected infants. Evolutionary rate and selection were estimated for each gene and in CTL-restricted and non-restricted epitopes. Evolutionary rate was higher in nef and gag vs. pol, and lower in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag and nef. Selection pressure was stronger in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag. The analysis also showed that infants with non-severe immunosuppression had stronger selection in CTL-restricted vs. non-restricted epitopes in gag and nef. Evidence of stronger CTL selection was absent in infants with severe immunosuppression. These data indicate that infant CTLs can exert selection pressure on gag and nef epitopes in early infection and that stronger selection across CTL epitopes is associated with favourable clinical outcomes. These results have implications for the development of paediatric HIV-1 vaccines."

Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."

In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs.

1085,0.005,1.0000,"Perinatal or mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains the major risk factor for chronic HBV infection worldwide. In addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccination, oral antiviral therapies in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and maternal and fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy. A protocol was developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline writing committee. We searched multiple databases for controlled studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Outcomes of interest were reduction of MTCT and adverse outcomes to mothers and newborns. Study selection and data extraction were done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 26 studies that enrolled 3622 pregnant women. Antiviral therapy reduced MTCT, as defined by infant hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4) or infant HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5) at 6-12 months. No significant differences were found in the congenital malformation rate, prematurity rate, and Apgar scores. Compared to control, lamivudine or telbivudine improved maternal HBV DNA suppression at delivery and during 4-8 weeks' postpartum follow-up. Tenofovir showed improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery. No significant differences were found in postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and elevated creatinine kinase rates."

Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3838,0.005,1.0000,"Low zinc levels and chronic inflammation are common in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Zinc deficiency may promote systemic inflammation, but research on the role of zinc in inflammation among HIV-positive individuals taking account of anti-retroviral therapy is lacking. We assessed the association between serum zinc and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in a cohort of HIV-positive individuals. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 311 HIV-positive individuals (177 men and 134 women) aged 18-60 years residing in Kathmandu, Nepal. High-sensitive or regular serum CRP concentrations were measured by the latex agglutination nephelometry or turbidimetric method, and zinc concentrations were measured by the atomic absorption method. Relationships were assessed using multiple linear regression analysis. The geometric means of zinc in men and women were 73.83 and 71.93 ug/dL, respectively, and of CRP were 1.64 and 0.96 mg/L, respectively. Mean serum CRP concentration was significantly decreased with increasing serum zinc concentration across zinc tertiles (P for trend = 0.010), with mean serum CRP concentration in the highest tertile of serum zinc concentration was 44.2 % lower than that in the lowest tertile. The mean serum CRP concentrations in men and women in the highest tertile of serum zinc concentrations were 30 and 35.9 % lower, respectively, than that in the lowest tertile (P for trend = 0.263 and 0.162, respectively). We found a significant inverse relation between log zinc and log CRP concentrations (beta for 1 unit change in log zinc; β = -1.79, p = 0.0003). Serum zinc concentration may be inversely associated with serum CRP concentration in HIV-positive individuals."

This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
97,0.005,1.0000,"Cambodian Americans have an elevated risk of liver cancer. This health disparity is attributable to high rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Our study examined factors associated with HBV testing among Cambodian men and women. A population-based survey was conducted in the Seattle area. The Health Behavior Framework guided our survey instrument development. We attempted to interview a man and a woman in each household. The sample included 300 men and 367 women. About one-half of the male (45%) and female (54%) respondents had been tested for HBV. Two factors were independently associated with testing among men and women: a doctor had recommended testing and had asked a doctor for testing. Knowing that someone who looks and feels healthy can spread HBV was independently associated with testing among men. Low levels of HBV testing remain a public health problem among Cambodians. Interventions should improve patient-provider communication by encouraging providers who serve Cambodians to recommend HBV testing, as well as by empowering Cambodians to ask for testing."

A survey was conducted with a sample of patients attending an HIV outpatient clinic at San Francisco General Hospital to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the level of interest in quitting. In total, 228 assessments were completed. Study results revealed a high percentage of smokers among our sample of individuals living with HIV compared to the percentage of smokers found in the general adult population. A total of 123 individuals (54%) reported that they smoked cigarettes. Men were more than twice as likely to have made previous attempts at smoking cessation than were woman.

7169,0.005,1.0000,"Five hundred ninety students receiving primary care in a university health service were surveyed anonymously in 1985-86 to study their self-reported sexual behavior and knowledge and attitudes about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most students (75%) were heterosexual; 3% were homosexual, 3% bisexual, and 15% had never been sexually active. Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS."

Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."

Cases were unevenly distributed geographically, particularly those among IDUs. The highest incidence within a post code district was approximately 2.5 times that for all Edinburgh. Annual cases peaked in 1984 then declined to low levels in the early 1990s. This reduction was most marked among IDUs, and may be ascribed both to changed injecting behaviour and decreased susceptibility within this group.

The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."

Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "

Furthermore, combination approaches could ameliorate the potential increased risk of infection following vaccination in the absence of protective immunity. We used a nonhuman primate model to determine potential interactions of combining a partially effective ARV microbicide with an envelope-based vaccine. The vaccine alone provided no protection from infection following 12 consecutive low-dose intravaginal challenges with simian-HIV strain SF162P3, with more animals infected compared to naive controls. The microbicide alone provided a 68% reduction in the risk of infection relative to that of the vaccine group and a 45% reduction relative to that of naive controls. The vaccine-microbicide combination provided an 88% reduction in the per-exposure risk of infection relative to the vaccine alone and a 79% reduction relative to that of the controls. Protected animals in the vaccine-microbicide group were challenged a further 12 times in the absence of microbicide and demonstrated a 98% reduction in the risk of infection. A total risk reduction of 91% was observed in this group over 24 exposures (P = 0.004).

Our results demonstrate that while >or=60% of serum samples are positive for NAs or ADCC antibodies, 72% of these serum samples mediate the enhancement of infection in the presence of complement. In patients with low CD4 counts, NA and ADCC antibody levels tend to decrease, while IEA levels increase. A significant positive correlation was found only between the presence of ADCC antibodies and the presence of antibodies that neutralized HIV-1 in the presence of complement. These results show that the anti-HIV-1 humoral immune response consists of a mixture of antibodies that may inhibit or enhance HIV infection and whose ratios may vary in different stages of the infection."
7996,0.005,1.0000,"The validity of self-report of drug use has been found to vary widely. Moreover, previous research has focused on samples of adults. In 1996-1998, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents and high-risk, noninfected adolescents (n = 182) were recruited at 16 locations in 13 US cities into the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) project, to the authors' knowledge, the first national study of disease progression among HIV-positive adolescents who were infected through sexual behavior or injection drug use. Self-report of marijuana use was assessed through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Urines were tested for marijuana at a certified laboratory by using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. Conditional kappas for 2-, 5-, and 7-day self-reports were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively. Maximum sensitivity was obtained from a combination of ACASI and urine drug testing. Contrary to previous studies, the data suggest that if a single evaluative instrument is to be used for prevalence, ACASI is more sensitive than urine drug testing for marijuana overall, but particularly for HIV-infected adolescents."
3257,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous host and viral factors likely participate in the onset and progression of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). Previous studies have suggested that viral gene expression in resident central nervous system (CNS) cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage play a central role in the production of neurotoxic viral proteins and infectious virus, deregulation of cellular gene expression, and/or dysfunction of glial and neuronal cell populations. HIV-1 replication is regulated, in part, by interactions between cellular transcription factors and the viral trans-activators, Tat and viral protein R (Vpr), with cis-acting promoter elements within the LTR. We have previously demonstrated that Vpr binds with high affinity to selected sequence configurations within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and downstream sequences immediately adjacent to this site. Studies reported herein establish a correlation between the diagnosis of HIVD and the increased prevalence of HIV-1 LTRs containing a C/EBP binding site I that exhibits high affinity for Vpr. To this end, the interaction of Vpr with C/EBP site I variants in 47 LTRs from three nondemented patients and 96 LTRs from seven demented patients was examined. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses were utilized to examine Vpr binding to oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP site I variants. We demonstrated that 89% of LTRs derived from patients exhibiting clinical dementia contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while only 11% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. In contrast, examination of LTRs derived from patients lacking clinically evident dementia revealed that only 53% of brain-derived LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while 47% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. We propose that sequence-specific interactions between cis-acting elements in the LTR, members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, and the virion-associated trans-activator protein Vpr play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD."

4385,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a case-control study to assess the association of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol drinking. We recruited as cases 172 subjects with an initial diagnosis of HCC, who were admitted to the two major hospitals in the province of Brescia, northern Italy, and 332 subjects, sex-, age-, and hospital-matched, who were admitted to the Departments of Ophthalmology, Dermatology, Urology, Cardiology, and Internal Medicine, as controls. Of the HCC cases, 23.8% were positive for HBsAg and 37.8% for HCV RNA; among the controls, 5.4% were positive for HBsAg and 4.8% for HCV RNA. History of heavy alcohol intake (>80 g of ethanol per day for at least 5 years) was found among 58.1% of the cases and among 36.4% of the controls. The relative risks (RRs) for HBsAg, HCV RNA positivity, and heavy alcohol intake were, respectively: 11.4 (95% confidence interval: 5.7-22.8), 23.2 (95% confidence interval: 11.8-45.7), and 4.6 (95% confidence interval: 2.7-7.8). Positive interactions (synergisms) between both HBsAg positivity and HCV RNA positivity and heavy alcohol intake were found, suggesting more than additive effects of viral infections and alcohol drinking on the risk of HCC. Infection with HCV genotype 1b showed a higher risk than type 2 (RR = 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-10), suggesting a major role for the former type in causing HCC. On the basis of population attributable risks (AR), heavy alcohol intake seems to be the single most relevant cause of HCC in this area (AR: 45%), followed by HCV (AR: 36%), and HBV (AR: 22%) infection."
3249,0.005,1.0000,"Patients treated with chronic dialysis have a high risk of acquiring viral infections and blood transfusions are commonly considered to be the vehicle of transmission. In Brazil this source is implicated in infection of 15 percent of patients developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). So, we evaluated the relative risk of our patients in dialysis becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus associated with the AIDS. An enzyme immunoassay showed 6 of 104 patients on dialysis to have antibodies to HIV. In five infection with HIV was confirmed by Western blot tests. Investigation of other risk factors for AIDS showed that blood transfusion was the most likely cause of contamination. There was no correlation between HIV and HBV infections. Only one patient had leucopenia and low OKT4/T8 ratio and she died 90 days after sorologic diagnosis of HIV infection; the cause of death was encephalopathy and sepsis. Two patients died after 4 and 16 months victims of cardiocirculatory problems (non-AIDS related causes). Three patients remain asymptomatic on chronic hemodialysis 20, 36 and 37 months after diagnosis of HIV infection."
4852,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."
8531,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence and the factors involved in discordant responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy were analysed in a closely followed cohort of 51 naïve HIV-infected patients at 48 weeks. A complete treatment response was considered as an increase in CD4 cell count of >or=50 cells/mm3 with a >or=1 log10 decrease in viral load or viral suppression. Virologic response (<50 CD4+ cells/mm3 increase) and immune response (<1 log10 decrease in viral load) were observed in 15.7% and 5.8% of the patients, respectively. We demonstrated that the prevalence of virologic response decreased at week 72 and disappeared after 96 weeks of treatment. This slower response did not correlate with protease inhibitor-based (PI-based) regimens or HCV coinfection. On the other hand, immune response in our cohort could be easily attributable to a simple mechanism, i.e. irregular treatment compliance."
7077,0.005,1.0000,"A high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load may increase the probability of HIV transmission by sexual contact, but the association of virus load of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with risk of HCV transmission is uncertain. HIV and HCV virus loads were examined in hemophilic men, as were risks of HIV and HCV transmission to their female partners in a hemophilia cohort in which most subjects are dually infected. A higher HIV load was associated with an increased risk of HIV transmission (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 per log10 increase in virus load). A higher HCV load was associated, although not significantly, with an increased risk of HCV transmission (OR, 1. 42 per log10). HCV load was higher among dually infected men than in those infected with HCV alone (P=.001). However, much larger studies are needed to clearly show whether HIV/HCV coinfection significantly increases the risk of HCV transmission to female partners."

We present a 55-year-old man with a history of an isolated squamous-cell carcinoma five years prior, who presented with 27 cutaneous lesions, which had developed over the course of the preceding year. This occurred in the context of a new diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The initiation of anti-retroviral therapy and subsequent restoration of CD4 counts was associated with an increase in the number of lesions. Histopathologic examination of representative tumors showed basal-cell carcinomas, which lead to the diagnosis of eruptive basal-cell carcinomas in the setting of HIV-related immunosuppression. The incidence and epidemiology of malignant conditions that are related and non-related to AIDS are reviewed as well as discussion of the current literature regarding presentation, treatment, and prevention of non-melanoma skin cancers in patients with HIV infection."
2638,0.005,1.0000,"Due to shared routes of transmission, acute and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus is common among persons living with HIV infection in many regions of the world. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute HCV infection has been increasingly recognized in HIV-infected persons, particularly men who have sex with men, and liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those with chronic HCV infection, particularly older adults with long-standing coinfection. Over the past decade, the foundation for the management of acute and chronic HCV infection has been interferon alfa. However, due the high burden of treatment-related side effects and low likelihood of sustained virologic response, the impact of treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin on the burden of HCV disease in has been limited. However, the anticipated availability of safe, tolerable and highly efficacious interferon-free, oral HCV direct-acting antiviral combination therapies promise to dramatically change the management of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected persons. Preliminary data from studies of such oral DAA regimens in HIV/HCV coinfected patients suggest that coinfection with HIV will not impair HCV cure with these regimens. Indeed, in the coming era of high effective oral HCV DAA treatments, the only special feature concerning treatment of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected patients may be drug interactions between the antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection and direct-acting antiviral drugs for HCV infection."
5265,0.005,1.0000,"Although coinfection with hepatitis C (HCV) is an established risk factor for hepatotoxicity in HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), specific variables that may be predictive of severe hepatotoxicity among co-infected patients receiving cART remain poorly defined. A retrospective cohort study of HIV/HCV coinfected adults from two HIV treatment centers covering the period between December 1998 and December 2003 was conducted to address this question. The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during follow-up and the primary predictors of interest were specific antiretrovirals. One hundred five coinfected patients receiving cART for a median of 70 months (interquartile range [IQR], 37, 83) were included in the analysis. Twenty-three (22%) patients developed a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT at least once in follow-up. In univariate analysis, current receipt of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (odds ratio [OR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-8.34, p = 0.03), baseline ALT (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02, p = 0.004), and current use of boosting ritonavir (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.16-7.00, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with a grade 3 or 4 increase in serum ALT, although most patients receiving boosting ritonavir were on lopinavir/ritonavir based regimens. Patients receiving LPV/r had been previously exposed to significantly more antiretrovirals (p < 0.0001), protease inhibitors (p < 0.0001), and nucleoside analogues (p = 0.0009) compared to the rest of the cohort. Further research to better clarify risk factors for hepatotoxicity in coinfected patients is warranted given the challenges in treating this population."
2608,0.005,1.0000,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."
3338,0.005,1.0000,"We assessed the factors that influenced improvement or progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."
4106,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) invades the brain early in infection and may cause HIV-associated dementia (HAD), which is characterized by reactive astrocytes, and macrophage and T-cell infiltrates. HIV-1 Tat protein is thought to contribute to HAD by transactivating host genes, such as that encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), although its mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We investigated the molecular pathways involved in Tat-induced MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression in human astrocytes. We found that Tat induced MCP-1/CCL2 synthesis in human astrocytes infected with a lentivirus carrying the gene encoding Tat or treated with a biologically active synthetic Tat protein. The induction of MCP-1/CCL2 was independent of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) classical pathway, but was significantly inhibited by specific cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) inhibitors, such as a dominant-negative mutant or siRNA. By contrast, broader-spectrum cdk inhibitors, such as roscovitine, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), and flavopiridol, inhibited MCP-1/CCL2 induction by Tat. We also analyzed the effects of roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol on Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) expression following the infection of astrocytes and HeLa cells. Astrocytes showed no inhibition by roscovitine, 59% inhibition by DRB, and 80% inhibition by flavopiridol. In control HeLa cells, high levels of inhibition were observed with roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol. We have ascertained the direct implication of cdk9 in Tat-induced MCP-1 expression by performing ChIP assay. These results demonstrate that cdk9 is involved in Tat-induced HIV-1 LTR, MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression."
7908,0.005,1.0000,"Arginine methylation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein downregulates its key function in viral-gene transactivation. The fate of methylated Tat is unknown, so it is unclear whether methylated Tat is degraded or persists in the cell for additional functions. Here we show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 increases Tat protein half-life by 4.7-fold. Tat stabilization depends on the catalytic activity of PRMT6 and requires arginine methylation within the Tat basic domain. In contrast, HIV-1 Rev, which is also methylated by PRMT6, is completely refractory to the stabilizing effect. Proteasome inhibition and silencing experiments demonstrated that Tat can be degraded by a REGgamma-independent proteasome, against which PRMT6 appears to act to increase Tat half-life. Our data reveal a proteasome-dependent Tat degradation pathway that is inhibited by arginine methylation. The stabilizing action of PRMT6 could allow Tat to persist within the cell and the extracellular environment and thereby enable functions implicated in AIDS-related cancer, neurodegeneration, and T-cell death."
3186,0.005,1.0000,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
2402,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progressively depletes GSH content in humans. Although the accumulated evidence suggests a role of decreased GSH in the pathogenesis of HIV, significant controversy remains concerning the mechanism of GSH depletion, especially in regard to envisioning appropriate therapeutic strategies to help compensate for such decreased antioxidant capacity. Tat, a transactivator encoded by HIV, is sufficient to cause GSH depletion in vitro and is implicated in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphoma. In this study, we report a decrease in GSH biosynthesis with Tat, using HIV-1 Tat transgenic (Tat+) mice. A significant decline in the total intracellular GSH content in liver and erythrocytes of Tat+ mice was accompanied by decreased gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulatory subunit mRNA and protein content, which resulted in an increased sensitivity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase to feedback inhibition by GSH. Further study revealed a significant reduction in the activity of GSH synthetase in liver of Tat+ mice, which was linearly associated with their GSH content. Therefore, Tat appears to decrease GSH in vivo, at least partially, through modulation of GSH biosynthetic enzymes."
4120,0.005,1.0000,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
1762,0.005,1.0000,"Transcription of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is governed by the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). By using HIV-1 LTR-directed reporter gene systems, we found that the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. The 293.27.2 cells that carry a stably transfected HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression vector (pNAZ) were used. Inhibitions of LTR were observed at camptothecin concentrations (IC50 about 0.03 microM, which was an order of magnitude lower than for Ro 24-7429), which had minor effects on cell survival, expression of the cellular gene gro, or Rous sarcoma virus-directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. Inhibition was also seen with RPMI 8402, which is a human CD4-positive lymphocyte line transiently transfected with a HIV-1 LTR-directed (CAT) gene. Experiments with HIV-1 LTR mutants suggest that transactivation response sequence but not NF-kappa B is responsible for the inhibition by camptothecin. The target for camptothecin may be a cellular factor that is important for the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat and thus may offer a potential target for therapy of HIV-1 infection."
4352,0.005,1.0000,"The transactivator of transcription, Tat, of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is required for viral replication. Inhibition of Tat function could have the potential to keep integrated provirus in dormancy. In the presence of Tat, Ro 24-7429, an analog of Ro 5-3335, inhibited expression of indicator genes controlled by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in transient transfection assays and in a constitutive cell line at noncytotoxic concentrations. Reduction of steady-state mRNA of the indicator gene by the compound correlated with reduction of the gene product in the constitutive cell line. Ro 24-7429 has broad activity against several strains of HIV-1 in different cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and macrophages (IC90 = 1-3 microM). Importantly, Ro 24-7429 inhibited viral replication in both acute and chronic infection in vitro, a characteristic expected of a Tat antagonist and not shared by viral reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Consistent with this, the compound reduced cell-associated viral RNA and proteins and partially restored cell-surface CD4 in chronically infected cells. After 2 years of continued weekly passage of the virus in fresh CEM cells grown in the presence of the compound at 1 or 10 microM, the virus did not develop resistance to the drug. These results indicate that the compound's action might involve a cellular factor."
8754,0.005,1.0000,"We examined 28 children with HIV-1 infection who were not responding to existing antiviral regimens and were enrolled into clinical trials conducted at the National Cancer Institute to receive salvage therapy. In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."
3621,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-infected individuals have poor responses to hepatitis B vaccine and may have decreased durability of post-vaccination immunity. Retrospective chart review was conducted for HIV-1 positive individuals aged ≥18 years who received hepatitis B vaccine at an urban HIV clinic. A total of 309 patients completed three doses and 178 had post-vaccine serology testing after the third dose. In multivariate analysis, time between the third dose and the first post-vaccine serology testing at 180-359 days (OR = 0.077, p = 0.049) and at ≥360 days (OR = 0.065, p = 0.019) were associated with poor vaccine responses. A significant decrease in seropositivity appeared as early as 180 days after the third vaccine dose, suggesting a rapid loss of vaccine-acquired hepatitis B surface antibody in HIV-infected persons. Our findings suggest that hepatitis B surface antibody should be tested at 6 to 12 months after completing primary vaccine series in order to detect early secondary vaccine failure."
9612,0.005,1.0000,"Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In screening of chemical libraries, we found 6-azido-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AzBBU) and 6-amino-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AmBBU) to be highly active and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in vitro. To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with escalating concentrations of each compound. After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were obtained, and they were more than 500-fold resistant to the uracil derivatives compared to the wild type. Sequence analysis was conducted for RT of the escape viruses at passages 12 and 24. The amino acid mutation Y181C in the polymerase domain of RT was detected for all escape viruses. Docking studies using the crystal structure of RT showed that AmBBU requires the amino acid residues Leu100, Val106, Tyr181, and Trp229 for exerting its inhibitory effect on HIV-1. Four additional amino acid changes (K451R, R461K, T468P, and D471N) were identified in the RNase H domain of RT; however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still unclear. In conclusion, the initial mutation Y181C seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the uracil derivatives AzBBU and AmBBU. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each mutation in the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance."
5207,0.005,1.0000,"The genetic basis for didanosine (ddl) resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has previously been shown to be commonly associated with a Leu to Val change at codon 74 in the HIV-1 RT gene. In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity. The AZT-associated Lys70Arg mutation results in an RT enzyme with decreased susceptibility to ddATP."
3297,0.005,1.0000,"RT-SHIV is a chimera of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing the reverse transcriptase (RT)-encoding region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) within the backbone of SIVmac239. It has been used in a non-human primate model for studies of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We and others have identified several mutations that arise in the ""foreign"" HIV-1 RT of RT-SHIV during in vivo replication. In this study we catalogued amino acid substitutions in the HIV-1 RT and in regions of the SIV backbone with which RT interacts that emerged 30 weeks post-infection from seven RT-SHIV-infected rhesus macaques. The virus set points varied from relatively high virus load, moderate virus load, to undetectable virus load. The G196R substitution in RT was detected from 6 of 7 animals at week 4 post-infection and remained in virus from 4 of 6 animals at week 30. Virus from four high virus load animals showed several common mutations within RT, including L74V or V75L, G196R, L214F, and K275R. The foreign RT from high virus load isolates exhibited as much variation as that of the highly variable envelope surface glycoprotein, and 10-fold higher than that of the native RT of SIVmac239. Isolates from moderate virus load animals showed much less variation in the foreign RT than the high virus load isolates. No variation was found in SIVmac239 genes known to interact with RT. Our results demonstrate substantial adaptation of the foreign HIV-1 RT in RT-SHIV-infected macaques, which most likely reflects selective pressure upon the foreign RT to attain optimal activity within the context of the chimeric RT-SHIV and the rhesus macaque host.

393,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer comprised of two structurally distinct subunits (p51 and p66). Since p51 and p66 are derived from the same coding region, subunit-specific structure-function studies of RT have been conducted exclusively by in vitro biochemical approaches. To study RT subunit function in the context of infectious virus, we constructed an LTR-vpr-p51-IRES-p66 expression cassette in which the HIV-1 vpr gene was fused in frame with p51, followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence and the p66 coding region. By coexpression with RT-deficient proviral DNA, we demonstrated that the p66 subunit is specifically and selectively packaged into virions as a Vpr-p51/p66 complex. Our analysis showed that cleavage by the viral protease liberates Vpr and generates functional heterodimeric RT (p51/p66) that supports HIV-1 reverse transcription and virus infection. By exploiting this novel trans-complementation approach, we demonstrated, for the first time with infectious virions, that the YMDD aspartates of p66 are both required and sufficient for RT polymerase function. Mutational analyses of the p51 YMDD aspartates indicated that they play an important structural role in p51 folding and subunit interactions that are required for the formation of an active RT heterodimer within infected cells. Understanding the role of the individual RT subunits in RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis is integral to our understanding of RT function. Our findings will lead to important new insights into the role of the p51 and p66 subunits in HIV-1 reverse transcription."
8377,0.005,1.0000,"The addition of adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) to ongoing lamivudine therapy is effective against lamivudine-resistant virus in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We studied 39 patients who received ADV added to lamivudine for breakthrough hepatitis. We determined early viral changes (12 weeks) in YMDD mutants (rtM204I [YIDD sequence], rtM204V [YVDD]) and rtL180M in all 39 patients as well as amino acid changes in the polymerase reverse transcriptase (rt) region and precore/core promoter mutations in 15 patients who received long-term treatment (more than 1 year). Changes in rtM204I and rtL180M viral loads were greater than that of the rtM204V, albeit statistically insignificant. Moreover, the greatest change in viral load was seen for rtM204I without hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The precore mutant was replaced with wild-type virus in three of eight patients after 1 year of added ADV therapy. Compared to baseline with lamivudine therapy only, new amino acid mutations were seen in the rt region at baseline with ADV in seven patients. At 1 year after ADV coadministration, the YMDD motif was replaced with wild-type (rt204M) in two patients, in whom mutations were fewer and of a different type. We conclude that the rtM204I may be more sensitive to ADV in vivo. ADV tended to select wild-type virus from precore mutants. Moreover, viruses that were wild-type in the rt region reappeared after 1 year of ADV coadministration in some patients."

Kato, Japan. J. Cancer Res. (Gann), 79, 418-423, 1988). Mouse hybridoma cell clones producing monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to HIV-1 gag p24 and p18, and pol reverse transcriptase (RT) were isolated by using this MT-4/HIV-1 cell line for the screening of MoAb production by the immunofluorescence (IF) test. By indirect IF tests of acetone-fixed cells with these MoAbs, the IF intensities in MT-4/HIV-1 cells were found to be higher than those in the other HIV-1 infected cells, such as MOLT-4/HIV-1, HL-60/HIV-1, and U937/HIV-1 cells. Cell surface expression of the HIV-1 gag p24 and p18 antigens examined by IF and radioimmune techniques with these MoAbs revealed the p24 and p18 antigens to be expressed strongly on the cell surface of MT-4/HIV-1 cells and faintly on the cell surface of MOLT-4/HIV-1 cells, respectively. However, monoclonal antibody isolated in the present study failed to detect pol RT antigen on the surface of MT-4/HIV-1 cells. These results indicate that the gag p24 and p18 antigens are expressed, at least in part, on the surface of HIV-1-infected cells."

We examined the genotypic and phenotypic changes at endpoint relative to baseline, including the emergence of individual reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations, in patients who received the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine and experienced virologic failure by rebound by the time of the Week 96 analysis. Patients received etravirine 200 mg twice-daily in combination with a background regimen containing darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. Virologic failure by rebound occurred in 93 (15.5%) etravirine-treated patients (compared with 170 [28.1%] placebo-treated patients). Patients experiencing virologic failure had more baseline antiretroviral resistance and lower activity of the background regimen relative to those not experiencing failure. Emergence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was observed in 55 of 93 patients. The most frequently emerging RT mutations were V179F, V179I, and Y181C, with positions K101 and E138 also showing frequent changes. Mutations usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI mutations and were, in most cases, associated with a decrease in phenotypic sensitivity to etravirine at endpoint. Further analysis is needed to clarify the role of mutations at position 138 as determinants of etravirine resistance."
5212,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was revealed by a severe acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg in a patient. The positivity of IgM anti-HBc antibody, the rapid negativization of DNA-HBV, the early normalization of liver function tests and the exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis favored the diagnosis of recent HBV infection and were predictive of a rapidly favorable outcome. However, immunohistochemical study of a transjugular hepatic biopsy sample discovered HBsAg within the liver, with a characteristic topographic distribution of chronic HBV infection. The patient's evolution confirmed this diagnosis, because 20 months later he had chronic active hepatitis with persistent replicative activity of HBV. This case illustrates the heterogeneity of HBV infections, emphasizing the need of an accurate diagnosis and a careful follow up until the complete resolution of each case of acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg."
7962,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to present a definition of late presentation according to different time periods between initial diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) diagnosis which would reliably identify individuals with high risk of mortality within 1 year of diagnosis, and could be used as a suggested common definition.Data of individuals diagnosed from 1994 to February 2012 in Wuhan, China were extracted retrospectively from the national HIV surveillance system. Four time periods (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) combined with the European consensus definition of advanced HIV disease (AHD) were compared. The predictive ability of each definition for identifying an individual who died within 1 year after HIV diagnosis was assessed.A total of 980 patients were included, of whom 289 (29.49%), 324 (33.06%), 353 (36.02%), and 387 (39.49%) were defined as AHD according to the definition of a CD4 count <200 cells/μL or AIDS-defining event (ADE) within 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of HIV diagnosis, respectively. One hundred twenty-seven (12.96%) patients died within 1 year of diagnosis. The highest Youden's index and largest area under the curve were presented in time period within 3 months. Time period within 1 month presented the highest consistency rate, positive likelihood ratio, and kappa value. Longer time periods increased the sensitivity but decreased the specificity.Given the European consensus definitions and the current results, we suggested that AHD could be defined as ""a first-reported CD4 count <200 cells/μL or an ADE within 1 month after HIV diagnosis."" ""Late presentation"" could be defined as ""a first-reported CD4 count <350 cells/μL or an ADE within 1 month after HIV diagnosis."" "
2528,0.005,1.0000,"While highly active antiretroviral therapy has been successful in delaying progression into AIDS, late HIV diagnosis remains a major contributor to the mortality and morbidity of AIDS. An epidemiological study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and factors of late diagnosis and the characteristics of those individuals with late diagnosis in Liuzhou city. Patients with late diagnosis were defined as either those who were diagnosed with AIDS at the time of HIV diagnosis or as those who developed AIDS no more than 1 year after HIV diagnosis. Of 899 participants, 72.6% had a late diagnosis. Common characteristics of those who experienced late diagnosis included older participants, those who were unexpectedly diagnosed while seeking other medical attention, participants who believed they could not acquire HIV from their regular heterosexual partners, those who never considered getting tested for HIV, and patients with unexplained weight loss, angular cheilitis, or prolonged fever prior to HIV diagnosis. On the other hand, those participants who were diagnosed via testing at compulsory rehabilitation centers and those whose annual household income was greater than 30,000 Yuan were less likely to be diagnosed late. These results suggested that late HIV diagnosis is common in Liuzhou city, and it is essential to promote appropriate strategies to detect HIV infections earlier. Strategies that require HIV/AIDS patients to notify their spouse/sexual-partners about their HIV-positive results within one month and start provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling in medical facilities are beneficial to earlier HIV diagnosis."
7638,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria. "

To determine the prevalence and clinical impact of HBV and HCV infection, we studied poly chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on the blood samples of 90 HD patients in Kerman, Iran. ELISA test was used to detect anti-HBc, anti-HBs and HBsAg. We found that 30 out of 90 (33.3%) patients were PCR-RT-PCR positive for HCV-RNA. No HBV-DNA (0%) was detected through the PCR study in both positive and negative HCV-RNA patient groups. Though none of the samples was HBsAg positive, 10 (33.3%) HCV-RNA positive patients were anti-HBc positive, and 12 (40.7%) were anti-HBs positive. We conclude that prevalence of hepatitis C infection is high in HD patients in our region, but not associated with active HBV infection."
4573,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
2398,0.005,1.0000,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "
6078,0.005,1.0000,"A prospective study was carried out on 200 patients admitted to Fairfield Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, with acute hepatitis A to determine the frequency with which virus could be detected in their feces. Evidence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) was obtained by detecting IgM specific for HAV in a single serum sample or by demonstrating a rising titer of antibody in paired sera by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. HAV was detected in the feces of 59 of the 200 patients by solid-phase radioimmunoassay and immune electron microscopy. When patients were admitted within one week of the onset of dark urine, 45% were found to be shedding HAV, whereas only 11% of specimens obtained from patients admitted during the second week contained virus. HAV was not detected in fecal specimens collected more than 14 days after the onset of dark urine. These findings suggest that patients admitted to hospital with hepatitis A may still be infectious and that appropriate precautions against fecal contamination should be maintained."
6194,0.005,1.0000,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is thought to be involved in the pathogenic and metabolic events associated with HIV-1 infection. We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."

This test is a blocking assay where anti-pre-S antibody in the patient's serum blocks subsequent addition of horse radish peroxidase-labelled polymerized human serum albumin (pHSA) to the pHSA-receptor site of HBsAg molecules fixed on a solid surface. Anti-pre-S activity was not detected in any from 95 healthy persons who were negative for all HBV-markers or from 105 healthy HBV carriers. In 12 sera from HBV vaccine recipients, anti-pre-S activity was noted in higher proportions compared with anti-HBs, after both the second and third doses of vaccine. Anti-pre-S activity was detected in small proportions of HBsAg positive sera from acute viral hepatitis (4.2%) and chronic active hepatitis (10%). In subacute viral hepatitis patients, the anti-pre-S antibody was totally absent. However, anti-pre-S activity was recorded in high proportions of HBsAg-positive sera from patients with cirrhosis of liver (57.2%) and fulminant hepatitis (41.6%). The anti-pre-S antibodies were assumed to be implicated in the clearance of HBV particles from circulation without causing tissue damage."
4437,0.005,1.0000,"Evaluation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific T-helper immunity could contribute in optimizing anti-HCMV therapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Testin the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) is the standard technique used to evaluate T-helper response, but its use in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting can be problematic. The most promising new alternative technique is the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency by flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokine production after short-term antigen-specific activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCMV-specific LPR and CD4(+) T-cell frequency were compared in a group of 78 blood samples from 65 HIV-infected patients. The results showed concordance in 80.7% of samples. In addition, comparative analysis of sequential blood samples from 13 HIV-infected patients showed that while in about half of patients the T-helper HCMV-specific immune response remained stable during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the other half declining levels of the HCMV-specific CD4(+)-mediated immune response were determined by either one or both assays. In conclusion, our data suggest that the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency can be considered a valuable alternative to the LPR test for the detection of HCMV-specific T-helper response in HIV-infected patients. It could facilitate wider screening of anti-HCMV T-helper activity in HIV-infected patients, with potential benefits for clinicians in deciding strategies of discontinuation or maintenance of anti-HCMV therapy."

5482,0.005,1.0000,"In 1994, Chang et al described a novel herpesvirus in tissues from patients with Kaposi sarcoma, referred to as Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus or human herpesvirus 8. They used a very sophisticated technique of molecular biology to isolate unknown DNA sequences from Kaposi sarcoma lesions, which were not present in normal tissues. It turned out that these sequences corresponded to a previously unrecognized gamma herpesvirus highly homologous to human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus) and to herpesvirus saimiri. Contrary to Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 8 is not ubiquitous. The seroprevalence of human herpesvirus 8 varies greatly worldwide, with 1% to 10% of people being infected in developed countries and up to 80% of infected individuals in some areas of sub-Saharan and equatorial Africa. Human herpesvirus 8 is associated with a limited spectrum of tumors, mostly observed in immunodeficient individuals with HIV infection. Beside Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease, human herpesvirus 8 is associated with primary effusion lymphoma, but unlike Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 8 is not involved in epithelial tumors. Different proteins of the virus can be detected in infected cells. Antibodies against the latent nuclear antigen 1 are available in routine pathology and represent a powerful tool to detect the virus in human tissues. Although Epstein-Barr virus is the most frequent causative agent of lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals, a systematic screening of such tumors with specific antibodies reveals that the implication of human herpesvirus 8 infection is probably underestimated. Recent descriptions of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in endemic areas, solid localizations of primary effusion lymphoma, and posttransplantation lymphoproliferations have expanded the spectrum of human herpesvirus 8-related lymphoproliferative disorders. In this review, we will be presenting an overview of the recent concepts regarding human herpesvirus 8 and related disorders."

We wished to investigate the prevalence, clinical correlates, and effect on treatment response of VprR77Q in a cohort of antiretroviral- naïve individuals initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Baseline plasma samples from 728 subjects were genotyped using RT-PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the effects of VprR77Q on virologic and immunologic responses, and survival following initiation of HAART, over a median 4.5 years follow-up. We found that 308 subjects (42.3%) harbored VprR77Q alone or in combination with another amino acid, while 420 (57.7%) harbored an amino acid other than Q. A cross-sectional analysis found no correlation between R77Q and baseline plasma viral load (pVL), CD4 count, diagnosis of AIDS, or sociodemographic characteristics including age, gender, and history of injection drug use (p > 0.1). In multivariate analyses, no significant associations between VprR77Q and initial pVL and CD4 responses to HAART or survival following initiation of treatment were observed (p > 0.1). The high prevalence and the lack of association with pretherapy clinical parameters in this cohort argue against an association of R77Q with LTNP status. These results do not support an association between R77Q and HAART response."

CCL3 and CCL4 are natural ligands for the primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor CCR5 and are also known to activate and enhance the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. Genomic DNAs from >3,000 participants enrolled in five United States-based natural-history cohorts with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were genotyped for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 47-kb interval on chromosome 17q12 containing the genes CCL3, CCL4, and CCL18. All 21 SNPs were polymorphic in African Americans (AAs), whereas 7 of the 21 had minor-allele frequencies <0.01 in European Americans (EAs). Substantial linkage disequilibrium was observed in a 37-kb interval containing 17 SNPs where many pairwise D' values exceeded 0.70 in both racial groups, but particularly in EAs. Four and three haplotype blocks were observed in AAs and EAs, respectively. Blocks were strongly correlated with each other, and common haplotype diversity within blocks was limited. Two significant associations are reported that replicate an earlier study. First, among AA members of the AIDS Link to the Intravenous Experience cohort of injection drug users, frequencies of three correlated SNPs covering 2,231 bp in CCL3 were significantly elevated among highly exposed, persistently HIV-1-uninfected individuals compared with HIV-1-infected seroconvertors (P = .02-.03). Second, seven highly correlated SNPs spanning 36 kb and containing all three genes were significantly associated with more-rapid disease progression among EAs enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study cohort (P = .01-.02).

4285,0.005,1.0000,"Sequence analysis of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF X) which has the potential to encode a 154-amino acid polypeptide. A fusion protein containing 145 of the amino acids encoded by ORF X and 8 amino acids of beta-galactosidase was expressed and characterized in bacterial extracts. Immunoprecipitations with the ORF X fusion protein as a radioactively labeled antigen were performed to screen sera of humans infected with HBV for the presence of antibodies against ORF X-encoded determinants (anti-X). Such antibodies were identified in 9 samples from a set of 26 sera characterized as positive for HBV surface antigen but were not found in 16 normal human sera. The data reported here demonstrate that sera from some patients with markers of HBV infection contain antibodies directed against the polypeptide encoded by ORF X. As such, these findings represent evidence that ORF X constitutes a gene, or a portion of a gene, which is expressed during HBV infection. Although there does not appear to be a direct relationship between anti-X and any individual markers of HBV infection, our data suggest that anti-X is more prevalent in HBV-positive sera containing antibodies to HBe3 antigen (anti-HBe3)."
8785,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of human immunodeficiency virus resistant to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex has been documented. Isolates from non-AZT-treated persons or those who had received AZT for less than six months showed a narrow range of susceptibility to the drug; on the other hand, isolates from those who had received AZT for six months or more consistently showed reduced susceptibility. Five highly AZT-resistant isolates were also insensitive to other compounds containing a 3'-azido group. No cross-resistance was found to other nucleoside analogues, including 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine. That cross-resistance occurred only in compounds containing a 3'-azido group suggests that mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene prohibit the enzyme from using nucleoside triphosphate containing a 3'-azido group. Progressive, stepwise increases in resistance have been associated with the sequential accumulation of specific amino acid changes in the reverse transcriptase gene. It is not yet known whether the resistant phenotype as determined in vitro results in clinical resistance to AZT. The gradual appearance of resistant isolates, the variable course of human immunodeficiency virus infections, and the absence of a consistent pattern of resurgent p24 antigen will make the emergence of AZT resistance difficult to correlate with clinical status or other markers. The combination of AZT with other drugs that do not share cross-resistance is a promising area for investigation to identify regimens that are more active and less likely to induce resistance."

In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."
1748,0.005,1.0000,"A peptide designated DP-107 was synthesized containing amino acid residues 558-595 of the envelope glycoprotein gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1LAI). Algorithms for secondary structure have predicted that this region of the envelope transmembrane protein should form an extended alpha-helix. Consistent with this prediction, analysis by circular dichroism (CD) indicated that, under physiological conditions, DP-107 is approximately 85% helical. The high degree of stable secondary structure in a synthetic peptide of this size suggests self-association typical of a coiled coil or leucine zipper. In biological assays, the peptide efficiently blocked virus-mediated cell-cell fusion processes as well as infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by both prototypic and primary isolates of HIV-1. A single amino acid substitution in the peptide greatly destabilized its solution structure as measured by CD and abrogated its antiviral activity. An analogue containing a terminal cysteine was oxidized to form a dimer, and this modification lowered the dose required for antiviral effect from 5 to about 1 microgram/ml. These results suggest that both oligomerization and ordered structure are necessary for biological activity. They provide insights also into the role of this region in HIV infection and the potential for development of a new class of antiviral agents."
987,0.005,1.0000,"Cell-mediated immune responses constitute a major defense against the spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, multiple alterations within a particular epitope may accumulate during disease progression, allowing the virus to escape cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Therefore, the best candidate for a peptide vaccine that would prevent the onset of the disease might be a chain section containing epitopes for the generation of CTLs in regions of conserved sequences among different HIV-1 isolates. We previously showed that immunizing mice with synthetic peptides consisting of 23-amino acids (Gag-23mer; 287-309 amino acid residues) in a highly conserved region derived from the major core protein p24 of HIV-1 generates specific CTLs as well as antibodies. Here, we identified one CTL (T-1; 291-300) and two B-cell (B-1; 290-299 and B-2; 300-309) epitopes, all of which consisted of 10 amino acids within the region. In addition, helper T cells primed by the Gag-23mer peptide were proliferated by in vitro stimulation with a 21mer (H-1; 289-309) or a 19mer (H-2; 291-309) peptide, but not with a 17mer peptide (293-309) or 19mer peptide (287-305). Immunization with the H-1 peptide generated an antibody reactive to B-1, but not B-2, whereas that with H-2 generated an antibody reactive to B-2, but not B-1. CTLs were not generated by immunization with these peptides, indicating that the entire sequence of Gag-23mer is the helper epitope for CTLs. Thus, the Gag-23mer is a chain section containing epitopes for cytotoxic T, B and helper T-cells within a highly conserved region of HIV-1 Gag protein."
9026,0.005,1.0000,"Many HIV-infected women are not realizing the benefits of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) despite significant advancements in treatment. Women in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) are highly marginalized and struggle with multiple morbidities, unstable housing, addiction, survival sex, and elevated risk of sexual and drug-related harms, including HIV infection. Although recent studies have identified the heightened risk of HIV infection among women engaged in sex work and injection drug use, the uptake of HIV care among this population has received little attention. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the needs of women engaged in survival sex work and to assess utilization and acceptance of HAART. During November 2003, a baseline needs assessment was conducted among 159 women through a low-threshold drop-in centre servicing street-level sex workers in Vancouver. Cross-sectional data were used to describe the sociodemographic characteristics, drug use patterns, HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and status, and attitudes towards HAART. High rates of cocaine injection, heroin injection, and smokeable crack cocaine use reflect the vulnerable and chaotic nature of this population. Although preliminary findings suggest an overall high uptake of health and social services, there was limited attention to HIV care with only 9% of the women on HAART. Self-reported barriers to accessing treatment were largely attributed to misinformation and misconceptions about treatment. Given the acceptability of accessing HAART through community interventions and women specific services, this study highlights the potential to reach this highly marginalized group and provides valuable baseline information on a population that has remained largely outside consistent HIV care."
1912,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
347,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of end-stage renal disease has increased dramatically in developing countries. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem that represents a significant co-morbidity event that has led to outbreaks of hepatitis B. There are inadequate data concerning occult HBV infection among Egyptian chronic hemodialysis patients. This study aimed to detect occult HBV infection among chronic hemodialysis patients in Alexandria, Egypt. A cross-sectional study was performed on 100 patients with end-stage renal disease that received maintenance hemodialysis and had tested negative for HBV surface antigen. Blood samples were collected before the initiation of hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies using ELISA, and HBV DNA was detected by SYBR Green real-time PCR using specific primers for the s and c genes and by nested PCR using pol gene-specific primers. The serum activity of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) were also measured. Anti-HCV and anti-HBc antibodies were detected in 34% and 48% of patients, respectively, and 70.6% of anti-HCV positive patients were also positive for anti-HBc antibodies. This association was statistically significant (p=0.001). HBV DNA was detected in 32% of the hemodialysis patients. A significant association was determined between the presence of HBV DNA and anti-HCV positivity (p=0.021). Aminotransferases were elevated in 21% of the studied patients, more often in patients with positive anti-HCV profiles than in patients negative for anti-HCV (p<0.05). In conclusion, the serological markers of HBV infection should be verified with molecular tests to investigate possible occult infections, especially among anti-HBc-positive hemodialysis patients, to improve our understanding of their clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological characteristics.

677,0.005,1.0000,"Triple combinations of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs are the standard treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but the challenges include long-term side effects, high costs, and adherence. The recent advent of potent and well-tolerated ART has renewed the interest for newer ART strategies. A dual regimen with the combination of dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV), two well-tolerated, metabolic-friendly, and potent drugs could offer additional benefits. Areas covered: A review of recent randomized trials and observational cohorts concerning the use of a dual therapy with DTG plus RPV as a switching strategy in patients with viral suppression. Expert commentary: Currently, data of more of 900 patients switched to this dual regimen are available. This combination shows a high rate of virological suppression, above 90% at 48 weeks, few discontinuations due to adverse events, improvement in bone and kidney parameters for patients discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lack of loss of the inflammatory control achieved with triple therapy, and a neutral effect on lipid parameters. Thus, for the first time, a dual regimen without protease inhibitors is effective, avoiding metabolic side effects and drug interactions. Longer follow-up is needed, but this dual regimen appears as a promising strategy for aging HIV-infected patients."
2893,0.005,1.0000,"Over a 15-year period, a white American woman was observed to have progressive hepatitis B that underwent hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positivity to anti-HBe positivity with development of cirrhosis. This patient was found to have a non-sense mutation in the second codon of the pre-C region of the hepatitis B virus genome after her anti-HBe seroconversion but not in her serum when she was HBeAg+. As controls, serial blood specimens were analyzed from 12 other American patients who spontaneously converted from HBeAg to anti-HBe, who underwent an interferon alfa-associated HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion, and who did not seroconvert with interferon alfa therapy. No mutations in the pre-C region were observed to arise in these individuals. In conclusion, non-sense mutations that occur in the pre-C region in locations other than the 28th codon can be associated with HBeAg negative progressive liver disease. This report of a non-sense mutation occurring over time is unusual in that it occurred in a white American patient."

However, a seropositivity for both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) subsequently emerged. An antiretroviral therapy was started while steroids discontinued. Patient's clinical conditions remained unchanged.

1784,0.005,1.0000,"The coexistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is unusual, but the occurrence of SLE after HIV infection is even less common. Both conditions share similar clinical features including constitutional symptoms, facial rash, oral ulcers, alopecia, arthralgias, arthritis, seizures, cytopenias, glomerulonephritis, and antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies. This clinical overlap makes the diagnosis of SLE in a patient with pre-existing HIV infection difficult. Furthermore, immune complex glomerulonephritis with features resembling lupus nephritis has been described in HIV-positive patients. We present the case of a 45-year-old Hispanic woman with long-standing HIV infection who developed membranous glomerulonephritis with histological features of lupus nephritis. Five years after onset of renal disease she developed clinically evident SLE."

Treatment commenced with a daily dose of 6 MU IFN alpha-2b for 2 weeks, which was changed to three times weekly thereafter. After 2 weeks, HCV RNA in the serum was undetectable and there was a concomitant reduction in proteinuria. Treatment with IFN alpha-2b was discontinued because of severe headache and fever. Five weeks after the discontinuation of IFN alpha-2b, the patient experienced the sudden onset of visual loss due to retinal hemorrhage. Subsequently, proteinuria and renal function progressively deteriorated though HCV RNA was undetectable. This case exemplifies the need for careful monitoring of renal function and retinal lesions not only in patients receiving IFN but also in those following the discontinuation of IFN treatment."

Concurrent infection with HIV may accelerate the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. Viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse are the main risk factors for HCC in developed countries. Exposure to these risk factors is common among HIV-infected patients. We report the case of a 43-year-old woman affected by HCC, with unusual soft tissue metastases (left masseter muscle) and HIV/HCV coinfection. The usual route of metastatic spread from classic HCC is hematogenous, with the most common extrahepatic site being the lung. Our case, besides the unusual distant metastatic site, showed very rapid clinical progression, as has been commonly observed in HIV-infected patients with HCC. The case series of HCC in HIV-positive individuals published to date does not cumulatively exceed 70 subjects."
3661,0.005,1.0000,"From 1988 to 1991, 6,882 drug injectors in 15 US cities were interviewed and had serum samples collected. The interviews and samples were analyzed for determination of significant predictors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion in the 10 low seroprevalence cities and the five high seroprevalence cities. The unit of analysis was the period of observation between consecutive paired interviews/blood samples. In Cox proportional hazards regression, significant predictors of seroconversion in the low seroprevalence cities were: not being in drug treatment, injecting in outdoor settings or abandoned buildings, using crack cocaine weekly or more frequently, engaging in woman-to-woman sex, being of non-Latino race/ethnicity, and city seroprevalence. Predictors in high seroprevalence cities were: injecting with potentially infected syringes, not being in drug treatment, and having a sex partner who injected drugs. These findings suggest that HIV may be concentrated in sociobehavioral pockets of infection in low seroprevalence cities. For reducing HIV transmission, these results suggest: 1) in low seroprevalence cities, localized monitoring to detect specific emerging sociobehavioral pockets of infection, and quick implementation of appropriate targeted interventions if necessary; 2) in high seroprevalence cities, relatively more emphasis on locality-wide outreach and syringe-exchange projects to reduce risky behavior; and 3) in both types of cities, considerable expansion of drug treatment programs."
3741,0.005,1.0000,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in cancer incidence, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, which arises from hepatocytes and accounts for approximately 70%-85% of cases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) frequently causes liver inflammation, hepatic damage and subsequent cirrhosis. Integrated viral DNA is found in 85%-90% of HBV-related HCCs. Its presence in tumors from non-cirrhotic livers of children or young adults further supports the role of viral DNA integration in hepatocarcinogenesis. Integration of subgenomic HBV DNA fragments into different locations within the host DNA is a significant feature of chronic HBV infection. Integration has two potential consequences: (1) the host genome becomes altered (""cis"" effect); and (2) the HBV genome becomes altered (""trans"" effect). The cis effect includes insertional mutagenesis, which can potentially disrupt host gene function or alter host gene regulation. Tumor progression is frequently associated with rearrangement and partial gain or loss of both viral and host sequences. However, the role of integrated HBV DNA in hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial. Modern technology has provided a new paradigm to further our understanding of disease mechanisms. This review summarizes the role of HBV DNA integration in human carcinogenesis."

3200,0.005,1.0000,"Sera from 79 patients with acute self-limiting hepatitis, 17 patients with acute hepatitis B evolving into chronic HBsAg carriership, and 43 chronic HBsAg carriers without a history of acute hepatitis were analyzed for presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA by a molecular hybridization technique. In acute self-limiting hepatitis, HBV-DNA was cleared within a few weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. The longest period of DNA positivity observed in this group was 42 days. In 29 of 52 patients HBV-DNA was cleared before HBeAg disappeared. Among 17 patients who became chronic HBsAg carriers, HBV-DNA was present for more than 6 months in all but one. Most of the HBsAg carriers eventually cleared HBV-DNA. The DNA clearance frequently preceeded the conversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. Thus, in many patients there was a transitional period with HBeAg but without HBV-DNA. HBV-DNA was found to be a better index of impending chronicity than HBeAg since persistence of HBeAg for more than 42 days was noted in 10% of the patients who nevertheless cleared HBsAg within 6 months. By that time all those patients had turned negative for HBV-DNA. On the other hand, in 16 of the 17 patients who became chronic carriers of HBsAg, HBV-DNA as well as HBeAg persisted for more than 6 months. The present results also suggest that infectivity in acute hepatitis B is a feature mainly of the presymptomatic and early symptomatic period."
6405,0.005,1.0000,"600 children born to HIV-infected mothers by June 15, 1990, in ten European centres were followed to study the natural history of HIV infection and the vertical transmission rate. They were seen at birth, every 3 months up to 18 months of age, and every 6 months thereafter. At last follow-up, 64 children were judged to be HIV infected and 343 had lost antibody and were presumed uninfected. The initial clinical feature in infected children was usually a combination of persistent lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly, though 30% of children presented with AIDS, or with oral candidosis followed rapidly by AIDS. An estimated 83% of infected children show laboratory or clinical features of HIV infection by 6 months of age. By 12 months, 26% have AIDS and 17% die of HIV-related disease. Subsequently, the disease progresses more slowly and most children remain stable or even improve during the second year. The vertical transmission rate, based on results in 372 children born at least 18 months before the analysis, was 12.9% (95% Cl 9.5-16.3%). Virus has been repeatedly isolated in an additional small proportion of children (2.5%, 95% Cl 0.7-6.3%) who lost maternal antibody and have remained clinically and immunologically normal. Without a definitive virological diagnosis, the monitoring of immunoglobulins, CD4/CD8 ratio, and clinical signs could identify HIV infection in 48% of infected children by 6 months, with a specificity of more than 99%."

The International AIDS Society-USA convened a panel of physicians and scientists with expertise in drug-resistant HIV-1, drug management, and patient care to review recently published data and presentations at scientific conferences and to provide updated recommendations. Whenever possible, resistance testing is recommended at the time of HIV infection diagnosis as part of the initial comprehensive patient assessment, as well as in all cases of virologic failure. Tropism testing is recommended whenever the use of chemokine receptor 5 antagonists is contemplated. As the roll out of antiretroviral therapy continues in developing countries, drug resistance monitoring for both subtype B and non-subtype B strains of HIV will become increasingly important."

We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."

HBV prophylaxis using hepatitis B immunoglobulin with nucleos (t) ide analogues were given and HBV DNA levels were consistently undetectable after LDLT. HCC recurred at 5 months and 13 months posttransplant respectively, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy were performed. HBV recurrence occurred during the treatment of HCC.

Despite tremendous advances in treating the disease and its related complications, a comprehensive, long-term disease management plan that includes recognition of patient concerns about quality of life is lacking. New approaches to managing HIV disease must now include strategies that address patient concerns about fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, malnutrition, and weight loss. Patients must become more involved in decisions about selection of specific drugs and drug regimens and must be consulted about their expectations and needs. We have made significant strides in the treatment of HIV disease. We can readily reduce the viral burden to virtually undetectable levels, and we must continue to develop even more potent and tolerable treatment regimens. We can make patients live longer.

We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."

Comprehensive assessment of whole-genome sequencing of HIV-1 eradicated cells ruled out any off-target effects by our CRISPR/Cas9 technology that might compromise the integrity of the host genome and further showed no effect on several cell health indices including viability, cell cycle and apoptosis. Persistent co-expression of Cas9 and the specific targeting guide RNAs in HIV-1-eradicated T-cells protected them against new infection by HIV-1. Lentivirus-delivered CRISPR/Cas9 significantly diminished HIV-1 replication in infected primary CD4+ T-cell cultures and drastically reduced viral load in ex vivo culture of CD4+ T-cells obtained from HIV-1 infected patients. Thus, gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 may provide a new therapeutic path for eliminating HIV-1 DNA from CD4+ T-cells and potentially serve as a novel and effective platform toward curing AIDS. "
3845,0.005,1.0000,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
1272,0.005,1.0000,"In order to analyse temporal trends in vertical transmission rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and determinant of congenital HIV infection in Italy, we have considered data from a network of hospitals co-operating in the Italian Collaborative Study on HIV infection in pregnancy, conducted between 1988 and 1995. A total of 1040 women entered the study. The HIV-1 status of the babies was known in 848 cases (81.5%). Transmission rates were highest in the period 1988-1991, then tended to decrease and in 1995 the rate was 9.7 per 100 children (this finding, however, was based on only six infected children and the trend was not statistically significant). Considering the overall series, the risk of vertical HIV transmission was higher in women with low CD4 count in pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) < 400 versus > or = 400 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9]. In comparison with vaginal delivery the risk of transmission was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) respectively for elective and emergency delivery. In comparison with women who delivered at term (> or = 37 gestation weeks) the OR of HIV infection of the babies for the whole series was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.6) in women who delivered preterm. Similar findings emerged when the analysis was conducted considering, separately, subjects observed in the period 1988-1991 and 1992-1995. The frequency of Caesarean section increased from 26.5% of deliveries in 1988-1991 to 36.2% in 1992-1995. Consequently, most temporal differences disappeared after standardization for mode of delivery, but the rate in 1995 was still lower than in 1988-1994."

The patient developed acute hepatitis C with symptoms of general fatigues, jaundice, and ascites 4 wk after the needle-stick injury. When these symptoms were presented, the patient was pregnant by artificial insemination. She hoped to continue her pregnancy. After delivery, biochemical liver enzyme returned to normal levels. Nevertheless, HCV RNA was positive and the pathological finding indicated a progression to chronicity. The genotype was 1b with low viral load. Daily intravenous injection of interferon-beta at the dosage of six million units was started and continued for eight weeks. HCV was eradicated without severe adverse effects. In acute hepatitis C, delaying therapy is considered to reduce the efficacy but interferon-beta therapy is one of the useful treatments for hepatitis C infection in chronic phase."
1891,0.005,1.0000,"The human placenta is relatively resistant to Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), but obstetric complications associated with inflammatory processes, including chorioamnionitis and spontaneous preterm delivery, are associated with increased rates of vertical transmission. It was hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory mediator tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which promotes HIV-1 transmission across endothelial membranes, increases HIV-1 transmission across the placenta. Flow cytometry and immunostaining studies were performed, which demonstrated that the HIV-1 receptors CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 were not expressed by villous trophoblast cells. Consequently, primary villous trophoblast cells were not infected with cell-free HIV-1 isolates, as measured by in situ PCR and quantitative PCR, but villous trophoblast cells were infected by HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). HIV-1 from infected PBMC was rapidly transported across confluent transformed trophoblast cell monolayers by transcytosis, and TNF-alpha significantly upregulated transcytosis of HIV-1 across the trophoblast layer without disrupting cell viability or confluency. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha (antibodies against TNF-alpha and TNF-alpha receptors) and an anti-inflammatory drug (tenidap) significantly reduced transcytosis rates. It was concluded that the villous trophoblast is resistant to infection by cell-free HIV-1 but susceptible to transcytosis of HIV-1 from infected PBMC, and inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha may play a critical role in promoting maternal-fetal transmission of HIV-1."
1123,0.005,1.0000,"In the last two decades, HIV-1, the retrovirus associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is globally one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing approaches for interventions are not able to suppress the progression of infection due to this virus. Of the many obstacles, viral entry into the mono-nuclear phagocyte system encompassing monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is a major concern. Viral infection is also responsible for the subsequent distribution of the virus into various tissues throughout the organism. Tremendous progress has been made during the past few years to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS infection, yet much remains to be done. Recommended treatment involves long-term and multiple drug therapy that causes severe side effects. With almost 12% of the world population suffering from HIV/AIDS, better management of this global threat is highly desired. Nanostructured delivery systems hold promise for improving the situation. Such systems can facilitate the uptake of antiretroviral drugs, causing a considerable improvement in HIV/AIDS therapy. Nanoscale systems have intriguing potential to drastically improve existing HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment platforms. Nanosystems constitute a wide range of systems varying from polymeric nanoparticles, to solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micro- and nanoemulsions, dendrimers, and self-nanoemulsifying systems. Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The present review initially describes an updated bird's-eye view account of the literature. Then, we provide a relatively sententious overview on updated patents of recent nanostructured delivery systems for antiretroviral drugs. Finally, we discuss low-cost therapy (such as antioxidants and immune modulators) for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "
4338,0.005,1.0000,"Live attenuated lentiviruses are potentially effective candidate HIV vaccines; however, delivery of these viruses in the field would be problematic. Delivery of attenuated lentiviruses as proviral DNA would be a simple means of immunization, but the efficiency of this method of delivery is not known. In this study, macaques were readily infected following inoculation of plasmid DNA encoding proviral simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac239), whether given i.m. (300 microg) or epidermally (15 microg), with all four animals succumbing to AIDS at a mean of 26 weeks following inoculation. Using a human skin explant model, we found that the 50% infectious dose (ID50) of proviral SIV or HIV-1 plasmid may be as low as 1 microg when delivered to skin by gold particle bombardment using a gene gun. An infectious proviral clone of SIV mac239 with a 105 bp deletion in the 3' nef/LTR overlap region was engineered (SIVsbbc delta3), analogous to the initial common nef/LTR deletion in HIV-1 strains isolated from an Australian cohort of long-term slow-progressors. Two further macaques were also readily infected with SIVsbbc delta3 after i.m. injection of 300 microg of highly purified plasmid DNA. Unexpectedly, in one macaque inoculated with SIVsbbc delta3 DNA, SIV strains isolated three to six weeks after infection had completely repaired the nef/LTR deletion with wild-type sequence, and eventually progressed to AIDS. The mechanism used to rebuild this deletion with wild-type sequence, presumably derived from an intact 5' LTR, is unclear, but possibilities include RNA read-through errors from the plasmid DNA and recombination with residual plasmid DNA at the inoculation site."

The study, conducted in a public maternity ward from May 2002 to April 2005, included all HIV-infected women who delivered live infants during the 36 months, and, as a control group, all HIV-negative women that delivered live infants in the first 12 months of the study. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 1,624 of 2,421 HIV-negative women (67%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 65-69%) and in 121 of 168 HIV-infected patients (72%; 95% CI 65-79%). A total of 547 HIV-negative and 103 HIV-infected patients were tested at delivery and had positive T. gondii-specific IgG. In HIV-negative women, the median of the specific IgG concentration was 79 (interquartile range 38-160), and in HIV-infected patients, it was 283 (interquartile range 94-704) (P < 0.001). In the group of co-infected women, the only infant with congenital toxoplasmosis was born to a mother with acute toxoplasmosis infection acquired during pregnancy who did not have a high specific IgG concentration or a positive result for specific IgM. We concluded that high T. gondii-specific IgG values were much more frequent among HIV-infected pregnant women, but it did not translate into an increased risk of maternal-fetal transmission of toxoplasmosis."
4135,0.005,1.0000,"Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together, AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutics.

4447,0.005,1.0000,"From the sera of patients with advanced cancer, a novel factor called SDF (serum-derived factor) was partially purified. SDF was shown to stimulate transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by transient CAT assay. It did not stimulate gene expression of various control promoters including Rous sarcoma virus, human c-fos, c-myc, c-H-ras and chicken beta-actin genes. The SDF preparation did not contain any detectable TNF-alpha or TNF-beta, and differed in its physicochemical properties from TNFs. We concluded that SDF might be a novel factor associated with the clinical features of advanced cancer. It is speculated that SDF might have some role in disease progression of AIDS as well as in the development of the cachectic conditions in AIDS associated with malignancies."

427,0.005,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the first approved HIV-1 entry into cells' inhibitor. It is a peptide with an amino acid sequence analogue to HR2 region of the viral surface glycoprotein gp41. Its mechanism of action is the competitive binding to HR1 region of the gp41, preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2 and impeding the conformational changes in gp41 necessary for fusion of the virus with the cell. Its application is by subcutaneous injection. The main clinical trials of enfuvirtide (TORO 1 and 2) were performed in HIV-infected patients with virological failure, high antiretroviral experience and highly resistant viral isolates. Those trials showed that the addition of enfuvirtide to an optimized HAART (chosen with a resistance test) provided better results than HAART alone, measured by drop in viral load and immunologic benefit. The best results were observed in the subgroup of patients with more useful drugs in HAART (according to the information of the resistance test), a lower viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count at baseline. The most important adverse event is the production of injection drug hypersensitivity reaction in 98% of patients. The high cost is compensated by a reduction in costs derived from admissions."
1768,0.005,1.0000,"The influence of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) upon hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine responses in HIV-infected individuals is unclear. After classification of vaccinees as non-responders (HBsAb <10IU/L) or responders (HBsAb >or=10IU/L) in our HIV cohort, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with subsequent vaccine response. Of 626 participants vaccinated from 1988 to 2005, 217 (35%) were vaccine responders. Receipt of >or=3 doses of vaccine (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.70), higher CD4 count at vaccination (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13 per 50 cells/microl increase), and use of HAART (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.56-3.62) were all associated with increased likelihood of developing a response. However, only 49% of those on HAART at last vaccination responded, and 62% of those on HAART, with CD4 count >or=350, and HIV RNA <400 copies/mL responded. Compared to those on HAART with CD4 count >or=350, those not on HAART with CD4 count >or=350 had significantly reduced odds of developing a vaccine response (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.70). While HAART use concurrent with HBV immunization was associated with increased probability of responding to the vaccine, the response rate was low for those on HAART. These data provide additional evidence of HAART benefits, even in those with higher CD4 counts, but also highlight the need for improving HBV vaccine immunogenicity."
8485,0.005,1.0000,"The recent availability of non-invasive tools to measure liver fibrosis has allowed examination of its extent and determination of predictors in all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. On the other hand, most information on hepatic fibrosis in HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected patients has been derived from liver biopsies taken before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was widely available. All consecutive HCV patients with elevated aminotransferases seen during the last 3 years were evaluated and liver fibrosis measured using transient elastography (FibroScan) and biochemical indexes. Patients were split according to their HIV serostatus. A total of 656 (69.6%) HCV-monoinfected and 287 (30.4%) HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were assessed. Mean CD4 count of coinfected patients was 493 cells/muL and 88% were under HAART (mean time, 4.2 +/- 2.4 years). Advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was recognized in 39% of the coinfected and 18% of the monoinfected patients (P < 0.005). A good correlation was found between FibroScan) and biochemical indexes [AST to platelet ratio index (r = 0.405, P < 0.0001), FIB-4 (r = 0.393, P < 0.0001) and Forns (r = 0.407, P < 0.0001)], regardless of the HIV status. In the multivariate analysis, age >45 years, body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m(2), and HIV infection were independently associated with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.

GBV-C-infected patients exhibited a complete virological response to HAART more often than patients without [correction] GBV-C and had a greater increase in median CD4 cell count and a marginally greater median HIV RNA level decrease. This association was found to be independent of baseline CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA, which indicates that an association exists between GBV-C infection and response to HAART."
4933,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been reported to restore defects in cell-mediated immunity to a significant degree, little is known of its effects in restoring HIV-induced abnormal antibody-mediated immunity. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1) 29 HIV-infected patients on chronic HAART whose HIV viral load was undetectable and whose absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had been consistently sustained by > or =150 cells/microL over their pre-HAART nadir value for >1 year; and 2) 29 untreated HIV-infected patients with current CD4 counts matching the treated patients' prior nadir CD4 counts. Serum was tested for total IgG and by protein electrophoresis with immunofixation for paraproteins. Although serum IgG levels were significantly lower in patients who had received long-term virologically effective HAART than in CD4 count-matched untreated patients (1488 +/- 475 mg/dL vs. 1999 +/- 775 mg/dL, p =.004), serum IgG was still abnormally elevated in 45% of the untreated group despite a mean 28 months of HAART-induced HIV suppression and CD4 count restoration. Paraprotein spikes were confirmed by immunofixation in 7% of patients in each group. This study provides the longest reported observation to date of the effect of HAART on HIV-induced abnormal antibody-mediated immunity.

A total of 726 blood samples were collected from two villages of the Car Nicobar Island where mass vaccination was performed in the year 2000. HBV DNA was isolated and the BCP and PC regions were amplified and sequenced directly. The samples positive for HBV DNA were tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe. Among the 211 and 515 samples collected from vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons, 16 and 82 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Among the vaccinated individuals, only 1 had a mutation in both the BCP and PC gene. Among the nonvaccinated subjects, 3 (4.5%) had an A1762T mutation, 8 (12.1%) had a G1764A mutation, 11 (16.7%) had a G1896A mutation and 4 (6.1%) had a G1899A mutation. The HBeAg-negative subjects had a significantly higher frequency of BCP and PC mutations than the HBeAg-positive subjects. The prevalence of a PC mutation was higher than that of a BCP mutation.

4112,0.005,1.0000,"Encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral macrophage-inflammatory protein-II (VMIP-II) is unique among CC chemokines in that it has been shown to bind to the CXC chemokine receptor CXCR4 as well as to a variety of CC chemokine receptors. This unique binding ability allows vMIP-II to block infection by a wide range of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) strains, but the structural and dynamic basis for this broad range of binding is not known. 15N T1, T2 and 15N[-HN] nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) values of vMIP-II, determined through a series of heteronuclear multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, were used to obtain information about the backbone dynamics of the protein. Whereas almost all chemokine structures reveal a dimer or multimer, vMIP-II has a rotational correlation time (tauc) of 4.7 +/- 0.3 ns, which is consistent with a monomeric chemokine. The rotational diffusion anisotropy, D parallel/D perpendicular, is approximately 1.5 +/- 0.1. The conformation of vMIP-II is quite similar to other known chemokines, containing an unstructured N-terminus followed by an ordered turn, three beta-strands arranged in an antiparallel fashion, and one C-terminal alpha-helix that lies across the beta-strands. Most of the protein is well-ordered on a picosecond time scale, with an average order parameter S2 (excluding the N-terminal 13 amino acids) of 0.83 +/- 0. 09, and with even greater order in regions of secondary structure. The NMR data reveal that the N-terminus, which in other chemokines has been implicated in receptor binding, extends like a flexible tail in solution and possesses no secondary structure. The region of the ordered turn, including residues 25-28, experiences conformational exchange dynamics. The implications of these NMR data to the broad receptor binding capability of vMIP-II are discussed."

These 63 cases and 103 controls with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology were studied in order to analyse the outbreak. The sources of infection were patients who were chronic HBsAg carriers. Infection was transmitted at the time of endomyocardial biopsy, if performed on the same day and in the same room after biopsy of an HBsAg positive patient. The most likely mode of HBV transmission was droplet contamination of instruments and/or medication vials used for subsequent patients.

The distribution and localization of HBV DNA were observed by using in situ hybridization. In addition, Southern blot analysis was performed in 23 of the 50 cases to reveal the state of renal HBV DNA. Thirty Six cases (72%) were found to be HBV DNA positive by in situ hybridization, which was localized in the nucleus of tubular cells. In 26 cases HBV DNA was simultaneously detected in the nucleus of glomerular mesangial and epithelial cells as well as in the mesangial matrix. Seventeen of the 23 cases proved to be HBV DNA positive by Southern blot analysis. In which 3 cases were identified as having non-replicating free HBV DNA, while 14 cases (82%) were of the integrated form. Since there was abundant evidence of the renal tissue being infected with HBV, it was considered that the HBAg deposited on glomeruli not only originated from circulation but also from the HBV infected glomerular cells. In addition to the humoral immune injury mediated by HBAg-HBAb immune complex, the cellular mechanism mediated by target antigen (HBcAg) may be also involved in the pathogenesis of HBV associated glomerulonephritis."
1505,0.005,1.0000,"Chemokine receptors serve as coreceptors for HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) T cells. Several reports have mentioned that density of CCR5 expression modulates in vitro viral replication and in vivo the course of the disease. Our goal was to investigate the impact of coreceptor density at the surface of a CD4(+) cell line on HIV-1 entry, replication, spreading, and programmed cell death. We engineered a CEM cell line that expresses constitutively CD4 and CXCR4 and CCR5 after transfection. This model allows us to compare the effect of the X4 and R5 strains to induce T cell death in the same T cell host. We show here that the extent of T cell death correlates with the rate of virus replication. X4 induces faster T cell death than R5 that depends at least in part on the higher density of CXCR4 compared to CCR5. Furthermore, sorting CEM populations expressing low, intermediate, and high densities of CCR5 molecules but constant amount of CD4, we found that the capacity to induce T cell death depends at least in part on the level of CCR5 when low amount of virus was used to infect the CEM cells. Moreover, viral transcription, assessed by cell-associated HIV-1 RNA/DNA ratio, was increased in CCR5high as compared to CCR5low cells, while inhibition of replication by zidovudine was more effective in CCR5low cells. Our data indicate that the density of chemokine receptors expressed on CD4(+) T cells may be a critical parameters for the cytopathic effect of HIV strains and may have major impact on CD4 T cell depletion during HAART."

In a large, randomized, double-blind, multinational, ongoing trial in treatment-naive patients with HIV-1 infection, raltegravir 400 mg twice daily was noninferior to efavirenz 600 mg once daily in achieving plasma HIV-1 RNA viral levels of <50 copies/mL after 48 weeks' treatment (primary endpoint), when used as part of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) combination regimen. The time to achieve a virological response was significantly shorter in the raltegravir group than in the efavirenz group. Furthermore, significantly more raltegravir than efavirenz recipients achieved HIV-1 RNA viral levels of <50 copies/mL at weeks 2-16. The efficacy of raltegravir in achieving HIV-1 RNA levels of <50 copies/mL was also demonstrated in subgroups of patients separated according to baseline viral levels, CD4+ cell counts and viral subtypes. Preliminary evidence suggests that both virological and CD4+ cell count improvements were maintained at 96 weeks for treatment-naive recipients of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily. As part of an ART combination regimen, raltegravir treatment was generally well tolerated and was associated with significantly fewer drug-related adverse events than efavirenz treatment. Moreover, after 96 weeks, raltegravir treatment was associated with a significantly lower impact on serum lipid levels than efavirenz treatment."

Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success.

8500,0.005,1.0000,"Although antiretroviral drug therapy suppresses human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) to undetectable levels in the blood of treated individuals, reservoirs of replication competent HIV-1 endure. Upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy, the reservoir usually allows outgrowth of virus and approaches to targeting the reservoir have had limited success. Ongoing cycles of viral replication in regions with low drug penetration contribute to this persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to illustrate a new approach to eliminating the part of the reservoir attributable to persistent replication in drug sanctuaries. Reducing the residency time of CD4 T cells in drug sanctuaries renders ongoing replication unsustainable in those sanctuaries.

Approximately 40% of the residents were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Two hundred thirty-five residents presented with clinical evidence of a flulike syndrome that was confirmed to be Q fever; moreover, a large proportion of residents developed an asymptomatic infection. Clinical signs and symptoms were rather nonspecific: fever, malaise, and muscle pain that were often associated with pulmonary symptoms. Single or multiple opacities were detected, with mild interstitial inflammation evident on chest roentgenograms. The source of infection was the sheepfold, which is part of the stock-farming activity of the community. Both outbreaks occurred just after lambing had begun. Residents who were exposed during the first epidemic were protected in the second one. The attack rate among HIV-positive residents was significantly higher than that among HIV-negative residents in the first outbreak, whereas only a slight, marginally significant difference was observed in the second outbreak. The clinical features of Q fever did not differ between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. No cases of relapse or chronic disease were observed."

2618,0.005,1.0000,"Retroviral integrase (IN) is expressed and incorporated into virions as part of the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. IN catalyzes integration of the proviral DNA into host cell chromosomes during the early stages of the virus life cycle, and as a component of Gag-Pol, it is involved in virion morphogenesis during late stages. It is unknown whether the scheme, conserved among retroviruses, for expressing and incorporating IN as a component of the Gag-Pol precursor protein is necessary for its function in the infected cell after viral entry. We have developed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion-associated accessory proteins (Vpr and Vpx) as vehicles to deliver both foreign and viral proteins into the virus particle by their expression in trans as heterologous fusion proteins (X. Wu, et al., J. Virol. 69:3389-3398, 1995; X. Wu, et al., J. Virol. 70:3378-3384, 1996; X. Wu, et al., EMBO J. 16:5113-5122, 1977). To analyze IN function independent of its expression as a part of Gag-Pol, we expressed and incorporated IN into HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virions in trans as a fusion partner of Vpr (Vpr-IN). Our results demonstrate that the Vpr-IN fusion protein is efficiently incorporated into virions and then processed by the viral protease to liberate the IN protein. Virus derived from IN-minus provirus is noninfectious. However, this defect is overcome by trans complementation with the Vpr-IN fusion protein. Moreover, complemented virions are able to replicate through a complete cycle of infection, including formation of the provirus (integration). These results show, for the first time, that full IN function can be provided in trans, independent of its expression and incorporation into virions as a component of Gag-Pol. This finding also indicates that the IN domain of Gag-Pol is not required for the formation of infectious virions when IN is provided in trans. The ability to incorporate functional IN into retroviral particles in trans will provide unique opportunities to explore the function of this critical enzyme in a biologically relevant context, i.e., in infected cells as part of the nucleoprotein/preintegration complex."

Transmission risk behavior, HAART-taking, and psychosocial distress of the growing population of Russian people living with HIV (PLH) in the HAART era are understudied. Participants of a systematically-recruited cross-sectional sample of 492 PLH in St. Petersburg completed measures of sexual and drug injection practices, adherence, perceived discrimination, and psychosocial distress. Since learning of their status, 58% of participants had partners of HIV-negative or unknown serostatus (mean = 5.8). About 52% reported unprotected intercourse with such partners, with 30% of acts unprotected. Greater perceived discrimination predicted lower condom use. A 47% of IDU PLH still shared needles, predicted by having no primary partner, lower education, and more frequently-encountered discrimination. Twenty-five percentage of PLH had been refused general health care, 11% refused employment, 7% fired, and 6% forced from family homes. Thirty-nine percentage of participants had probable clinical depression, 37% had anxiety levels comparable to psychiatric inpatients, and social support was low. Of the 54% of PLH who were offered HAART, 16% refused HAART regimens, and 5% of those on the therapy took less than 90% of their doses. Comprehensive community services for Russian PLH are needed to reduce AIDS-related psychosocial distress and continued HIV transmission risk behaviors.

Despite the wealth of studies in examining antiretroviral non-adherence, few have distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The present study attempted to identify factors associated with adherence, intentional non-adherence, and unintentional non-adherence among HIV+ individuals using a longitudinal design. Dietary instructions and medication schedule were also included to measure the subtleties of antiretroviral adherence. One hundred and two HIV+ patients who were under antiretroviral therapy were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong at baseline with six months follow-up. Using the conventional adherence rate, only 12 (11.8%) of participants reported having missed/ altered medication in the past four days. However, using a more comprehensive assessment, only 27 (26.5%) participants were classified as adherers. Results showed that, adherers were significantly older and had higher adherence self-efficacy than those who were unintentional or intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as unintentional non-adherers had longer length of diagnosis and started medication longer than adherers and intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as intentional non-adherers had worse mental health, higher level of self-stigma, and reported higher score in avoidant coping than adherers and unintentional non-adherers. They also scored higher in physical symptoms than adherers. Findings highlight the importance of a reliable, comprehensive measurement for adherence and extend on previous adherence literature that intentional and unintentional non-adherence are separate entities and are associated with different factors. Future research should understand the intentions behind non-adherence and this would serve as an important guide in the development of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral adherence for HIV+ patients."

In a case control study, 54 controls currently tolerating TMP/SMX prophylaxis were randomly matched by date of hypersensitivity reaction in case patients to 28 patients with a history of a rash consistent with erythema multiforme from TMP/SMX. Demographic data, coadministered medications, laboratory data, and histories of opportunistic infections were extracted on all patients. A highly significant association was observed between the number of opportunistic infections and the occurrence of TMP/SMX hypersensitivity (p < 0.001), despite comparability of CD4 counts between case patients and controls (p > 0.1). A tendency for protection from TMP/SMX hypersensitivity in blacks was also observed (p = 0.066). These observations suggest that the mechanisms by which HIV produces cellular immune dysfunction and alters drug detoxification may be linked."

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for relevant case reports and reviews published before February 2009. Patients were included if they had HIV infection and radiographic imaging consistent with fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy. We identify 11 published adult cases of intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy and describe 1 unpublished case from our own institution. Available data regarding clinical presentation, characteristic imaging findings, and treatment of this complex syndrome are reviewed. Adults with HIV-associated intracranial aneurysmal vasculopathy typically are significantly immunosuppressed and present with gross neurologic dysfunction. Characteristic radiographic findings include diffuse cerebral fusiform aneurysms with hemorrhage or infarct.

Despite these benefits, treated patients remain at high risk of chronic diseases affecting the peripheral organs and brain. Generally, these morbidities are attributed to persistence of latent HIV in resting T cells, chronic inflammation, and metabolic effects of ART. This review makes the case that monocytes/macrophages warrant attention as persistent reservoirs of HIV under ART, source of systemic and brain inflammation, and important targets for HIV eradication to control chronic HIV diseases.

4905,0.005,1.0000,"The presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three groups (group 1, more than 500 CD4+ T cells per microliter; group 2, between 200 and 499 CD4+ T cells per microliter; group 3, fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter) of HIV-1-infected patients, in different stages of the disease, was determined by using a newly developed flow cytometry analysis of the product of in situ PCR assay and compared with other markers of viral replication (HIV-1 p24 antigenemia and viral isolation). Results showed varied percentages of HIV-1-infected PBMC, ranging from 0.6 to 20%. Patients with more than 500 CD4+ T cells per microliter showed the lowest percentage of HIV-1-infected PBMC (2.1 +/- 1.7), compared with patients with CD4+ T-cell counts of between 200 and 499 per microliter (6.5% +/- 4.1%; P < 0.001) and patients with fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter (4.9% +/- 4.7%; P < 0.05). The difference in the percentage of HIV-1-infected PBMC between group 2 and group 3 patients may in part reflect the loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes in more advanced stages of the disease. However, the results clearly indicate a striking coincidence between the fall of the CD4+ T-cell count below 400/microliter and the sharp increase in PBMC virus loading and p24 antigenemia. Since the procedure is relatively easy to perform, it could be used to monitor the evolution of HIV-1 infection and may prove a useful adjunct in tailoring therapeutic strategies."
6429,0.005,1.0000,"The relationship between blood CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets, as defined by CD28 and CD38 expression, and plasma viraemia and CD4+ T cells in HIV-1 infection was investigated. In a cross-sectional study of 46 patients with either no or stable anti-retroviral treatment, there was a strong negative correlation between the percentage of CD8+CD28- and the percentage of CD4+ T cells (r = -0.75, P < 0.0001), and a positive correlation between absolute numbers of CD8+CD28+ and CD4+ T cells (r = 0.56, P < 0.0001). In contrast, the expression of CD38 by CD8+ T lymphocytes correlated primarily with plasma viraemia (e.g. the percentage of CD38+ in CD8bright cells, r = 0.76, P < 0.0001). In the 6 months following triple therapy initiation in 32 subjects, there was a close correlation between changes (delta) in CD8+CD28+ or CD8+CD28- and in CD4+ T cells (e.g. delta % CD8+CD28+ versus delta % CD4+, r = 0.37, P = 0.0002; delta % CD8+CD28- versus delta % CD4+, r = -0.66, P < 0.0001). A marked decline of the number of CD8+ T cells expressing CD38 was also observed. These results suggest the existence of a T cell homeostasis mechanism operating in blood with CD4+ and CD8+CD28+ cells on the one hand, and with CD8+CD28- cells on the other. In addition, the percentage of CD38+ cells in CD8+ cells, generally considered an independent prognostic factor, could merely reflect plasma viral load."

HBV DNA sequences were detected in monocytes of 42(60%) of the 70 patients. The percentage of monocyte-expressing HLADR and the TNF alpha content in monocyte culture supernatant were significantly elevated in patients with HBV DNA-positive monocytes compared with those patients with HBV-DNA-negative monocytes. The percentage of monocyte-expressing HLA-DA and the level of TNF alpha produced by monocytes correlated markedly with the intensity of HBV DNA-positive signal in monocytes. These data suggested that HBV infection in monocytes might cause a series of functional changes in these cells."

Patients with AIDS (n = 11) or ARC (n = 7) had 9% higher rates of REE when compared with 11 healthy volunteers (P less than .05) with similar food intake and of the same body composition. The results obtained from patients with AIDS or ARC were identical. As no differences were found between patients and controls in plasma concentrations of catecholamines, thyroid hormones, cortisol, or tumor necrosis factor, except for lower concentrations of norepinephrine in the patients (mean +/- SD, 233 +/- 111 v 367 +/- 125 ng/L, patients v controls, P less than .01), this hypermetabolism is not explained by higher levels of these catabolic hormones. The results indicate that even in the absence of acute concomitant infections, increased REE may contribute to the weight loss in patients with AIDS or ARC."
1647,0.005,1.0000,"In this study, we sought to characterize the T lymphocyte recovery in vertically HIV-1-infected children who respond to long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A 3-year longitudinal retrospective study was used to perform a cross-sectional study of 32 children rated according to the time course of CD4(+) T cell percentages in response to antiretroviral therapy and CDC clinical classification: (1) long-term asymptomatic (LTA group): 8 children in A1 during the whole follow-up period; (2) responsive to HAART (Rec group): 13 children in C3 before HAART who achieved CD4(+) T cell counts of > 500 cells/mm(3) after 3 years of HAART; and (3) nonresponsive to HAART (Non-Rec group): 11 children in C3 during the whole follow-up period despite 3 years of HAART. We also studied 17 healthy age-matched uninfected children as controls. Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) were evaluated by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine, identification of T cell subsets by three-color flow cytometry, and determination of thymic production of T cells by quantification of T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). Interestingly, the Rec group showed an increase in percentage of CD4(+) T cells and a decrease in viral load, and recovered LPRs to mitogens and recall antigens, with values similar to those of the LTA group. Moreover, the Rec group produced similar percentages and absolute counts of naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and TRECs similar to those of the LTA group. In particular, the Rec group produced similar percentages of CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(+) and CD8(+)CD28(-)CD57(-) T cell subsets compared with controls. Our data indicate that among children who have already progressed to AIDS and severe immunodeficiency but who respond to HAART, the immune system can recover and resemble those of nonprogressors or even uninfected children, in quantitative as well as in functional terms."
8220,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are leading causes of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Because underreporting has complicated the understanding of disease burden, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine requested that CDC perform a comprehensive evaluation of national viral hepatitis surveillance. Hepatitis surveillance data rely on local and state estimates, and a better understanding of reporting at these levels can inform strategies to improve national data quality. As an initial assessment, CDC partnered with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and an urban health-care system in southeastern Michigan to evaluate the completeness of reporting (including case status, demographic, and risk factor information) of cases of chronic HBV and HCV infection among persons who were enrolled in a multicenter chronic hepatitis cohort study to the MDCH viral hepatitis registry. This report summarizes the results of that assessment. Among clinically confirmed chronic hepatitis infections, 82% of HBV infections and 65% of HCV infections were reported. Completeness of reporting of chronic HBV and HCV infections was significantly improved for those with more recent clinical diagnoses, but reporting still remained incomplete. The completeness of reporting varied significantly by demographic characteristics of patients with HCV infection. Few reports of either HBV or HCV infection included risk factors. Improving surveillance of chronic hepatitis in Michigan will require exploration of more efficient methods for the transfer of laboratory and clinical data and evaluation of the most appropriate sources for risk factor information to aid in the prevention of viral hepatitis transmission. Similar collaborations with health-care institutions that use electronic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and laboratory data can provide local and state health departments with insight into the challenges to case reporting in their jurisdictions."
2290,0.005,1.0000,"Immune activation seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The immune activation markers neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin can predict the future rate of the decrease in CD4+ T cells. In a longitudinal study, we assessed whether the decline in the CD4+ T-cell count is associated with increased concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 75 (sTNFR 75), compared to increased concentrations of beta 2-microglobulin and urinary neopterin. Forty-seven individuals representing all stages of HIV infection were followed-up for a mean of 12.7 months (range, 8 to 16 months). The percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count from study entry to study end ranged from -97 to +98%; the median was -33%. Concentrations of urinary neopterin, sTNFR 75, and beta 2-microglobulin correlated with the percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count from study entry to study end (r = -0.45, confidence interval (CI) -0.65 to -0.19; r = -0.42, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.15; and r = -0.416, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.15), but those of sICAM-1 did not. This difference was found despite significant correlations between sICAM-1 and sTNFR 75 and beta 2-microglobulin. Levels of sICAM-1 obtained at study entry correlated with levels of sICAM-1 obtained at study end (r = 0.46, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.68). In a multivariate linear regression analysis, urinary neopterin and sTNFR 75 were jointly significant for the percentage of the change of the CD4+ T-cell count. These results suggest that sTNFR 75 is a useful marker to estimate disease progression in HIV infection, whereas sICAM-1 does not seem to provide any information related to the decline of the CD4+ T-cell count."

A questionnaire exploring risk factors was completed for each patient and staff member. Sera were tested for HIV I antibodies by ELISA (ELAVIA) and confirmed by Western Blot. Of the 347 HD + HDT patients, 4 were found to be positive. Of the 221 HD patients, 1 multi-transfused hemophiliac and 1 multitransfused Nigerian without other risk factors were positive in the first screening. Another patient seroconverted after transfusion during the study; no other risk factors existed and the donor has not yet been found. One of the 126 HDT patients had received infected plasma. No staff members or PD patients were positive. No transmission within centers, from patient-to-patient or patient-to-staff was evidenced. Although HIV I seems to be less infectious than HBV, precautions to prevent transmission of HIV I in dialysis centers should be maintained."

However, the role of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is yet undetermined. Forty-five consecutive Nigerian patients with Acute Icteric hepatitis (AIH) attending the Medical Clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria and 45 healthy adult Nigerians (controls) were studied for evidence of infection with both viruses. Questionnaire on risk procedures which predispose to acquisition of both HBV and HCV infections were administered to the patients. Blood samples were collected from all the subjects and tested for antibody to HCV (Anti-HCV) and Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) using the second generation Enzyme Linked Immunoassay (Monolisa -R, Sansofi, Pasteur; France). Anti-HCV was detected in 21(47%) and 17(38%) of the patients and controls respectively. The corresponding prevalences of HBsAg were 38(84%) and 11(24%), p < 0.001. Hepatitis B virus infection was found to occur more than HCV infection in the patients with AIH but similar among the controls. Combined HBV and HCV infection occurred more frequently among the patients (42.1%) than in the control (11%) (; < 0.001). Although there was no significant difference in the HCV infection between the two groups, isolated HCV infection is commoner in the control than in the patients with AIH, (p < 0.001). Similarly, single HCV infection is commoner than lone HBV infection among the control, p < 0.05. In summary, this study shows that while both HBV and HCV infections are common in Nigeria, AIH may be more associated with HBV than HCV in the country."

It also sought to elicit barriers to, and facilitators of disclosure; and any association between disclosure and health outcomes. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 110 parents/caregivers of children ≥6 years. CD4 count, viral load, opportunistic infections and adherence information were also extracted from medical records for all 110 children. The mean age of the children in the study was 10.15 years (SD = 2.97), with a median (range) of 9.50 (6-18) years. According to parents/caregivers' accounts, 34 (30.9%) children knew that they were living with HIV, while 74 (67.3%) did not know. Mean age at disclosure was 10.47 years (SD = 2.62), with a median (range) of 10.00 (6-17) years. Most children (79.4%) were disclosed at home by their parent(s)/caregiver. The rest were disclosed at the hospital: five were disclosed by a healthcare provider, while two were accidentally disclosed. The most common reasons for disclosure were related to adherence issues - either to help prepare the children to take their medicines or that the child had refused to take his/her medicines (39.4%). This was followed by the child asking a lot of questions related to his/her health, frequent visits to the hospital, or why s/he was taking a lot of medicines even though s/he did not feel ill (27.3%). Most parents/caregivers did not disclose because the child was considered too young (84.0%) or will not be able to keep their HIV status a secret (10.7%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that only child's age was a statistically significant predictor of status disclosure (OR 1.69, p = .002; 95% CI 1.21-2.34). There was no association between disclosure and self-reported adherence (p = .615)."

Our aim was to correlate the CD8+ T cell response with the outcome of infection. Eighteen patients with acute hepatitis C and 19 normal donors were studied. Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8+ T cells were identified in the enzyme-linked immunospot assay by their interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production after specific stimulation. The highest numbers of IFN-gamma-producing HCV-specific CD8+ T cells were found in patients with acute hepatitis C and a self-limited course of disease during the first 6 months after onset of disease, but these numbers dropped thereafter to undetectable levels. The differences in responsiveness between patients with self-limited disease versus patients with a chronic course were statistically significant (P<.001). Our data show that the number of IFN-gamma-producing HCV-specific CD8+ T cells during the first 6 months after onset of disease is associated with eradication of the HCV infection."

In vitro evidence indicates that some PIs reduce adipocyte lipoprotein (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) expression and activities. We examined whether LPL and HL activities are reduced in HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia. Fasting serum lipids, glucoregulatory hormones, and postheparin LPL and HL activities, as well as whole body and regional adiposity, were measured in 19 HIV-seronegative controls, 9 HIV+ patients naive to all anti-HIV medications, 9 HIV+ patients naive to PIs, 9 HIV+ patients with prior PI experience but not currently receiving PIs, and 47 HIV+ patients receiving PI-HAART. The PI-HAART group had low LPL and HL activities. However, multiple linear regression analysis indicated that low postheparin LPL activity contributed only partially to HIV-dyslipidemia. Central adiposity and high C-peptide levels (an indicator of high insulin secretion) were stronger predictors of HIV-dyslipidemia. Low LPL and HL activities, by themselves, were insufficient to explain HIV-dyslipidemia because the PI-naive group had low LPL and HL activities but had normal adiposity, C-peptide levels, and serum lipid and lipoprotein levels. HDL-cholesterol was lower in PI-HAART and PI-naive groups than seronegative controls and was directly associated with LPL activity. These findings suggest that HIV-dyslipidemia is mediated primarily by factors that influence triglyceride and lipoprotein synthesis (e.g., central adiposity and hyperinsulinemia) and mediated only partially by factors that influence triglyceride clearance (e.g., lipase activity)."

We aimed to identify risk factors of HEV among acute hepatitis cases, measure HEV specific immune response to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. The study included symptomatic acute hepatitis (AH) patients (n = 235) and asymptomatic contacts (n = 200) to HEV cases. They completed a lifestyle questionnaire, screened for common hepatotropic viruses. Blood and serum samples were collected from patients and contacts after onset of disease and follow-up samples collected until convalescence. PBMC were separated and tested for specific HEV T-cell response by INF-gamma ELISPOT assay. Serum samples were tested for IgM and IgG anti-hepatitis E virus by ELISA. IgM antibodies to HAV were detected in 19 patients (8.1%), 37 (15.7%) with HBV, 10 (4.3%) with HCV. HEV infection was identified in 42 (16%) patients with AVH. Of the 200 contacts, 14 (7%) had serological evidence of recent HEV asymptomatic infection, showed stronger CMI responses than HEV infected subjects (2540 +/- 28 and 182 +/- 389 ISCs/106 cells, respectively; P < 0.05). In conclusion, HEV is a major cause of AVH in Egypt. Asymptomatic HEV patients are likely to have stronger immune responses including CMI responses, than symptomatic cases."
2289,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat protein is an important pathogenic factor in HIV-associated neuropathogenesis. Despite recent progress, the molecular mechanisms underlying Tat neurotoxicity are still not completely understood. However, few therapeutics have been developed to specifically target HIV infection in the brain. Recent development of an inducible brain-specific Tat transgenic mouse model has made it possible to define the mechanisms of Tat neurotoxicity and evaluate anti-neuroAIDS therapeutic candidates in the context of a whole organism. Herein, we demonstrate that administration of EGb 761, a standardized formulation of Ginkgo biloba extract, markedly protected Tat transgenic mice from Tat-induced developmental retardation, inflammation, death, astrocytosis, and neuron loss. EGb 761 directly down-regulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression at both protein and mRNA levels. This down-regulation was, at least in part, attributable to direct effects of EGb 761 on the interactions of the AP1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors with the GFAP promoter. Most strikingly, Tat-induced neuropathological phenotypes including macrophage/microglia activation, central nervous system infiltration of T lymphocytes, and oxidative stress were significantly alleviated in GFAP-null/Tat transgenic mice. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence to support the potential for clinical use of EGb 761 to treat HIV-associated neurological diseases. Moreover, these findings suggest for the first time that GFAP activation is directly involved in Tat neurotoxicity, supporting the notion that astrocyte activation or astrocytosis may directly contribute to HIV-associated neurological disorders."
7971,0.005,1.0000,"We have previously shown that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein can activate a synthetic promoter containing consensus-binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. In this report, we show that a GAL-Tat fusion protein targeted via GAL4 DNA-binding sites can also trans activate an HIV-1 LTR promoter independently of the trans-activation response region. To show that the trans activation of the promoter by Tat directly involves the Sp1 protein, we have targeted a GAL-Sp1 fusion protein to the long terminal repeat promoter via upstream GAL4-binding sites. In the presence of Tat and GAL-Sp1, the promoter is synergistically trans activated at the transcriptional level, indicating that Tat and Sp1 functionally interact to trans activate the HIV-1 promoter. The Sp1 synergism is relatively specific, since another chimeric transcriptional activator, GAL-VP16, does not appear to be significantly synergistic with Tat."
6122,0.005,1.0000,"JC virus (JCV) is the etiological agent of an opportunistic brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in AIDS. PML is fatal in approximately 4% of HIV-infected individuals, and although the overall incidence has fallen due to highly aggressive antiretroviral therapy (HAART), this percent has remained steady. It has been shown that the Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) interacts in cells with cellular protein Puralpha. This interaction can stimulate transcription of both HIV-1 and JCV genes. HIV-1, however, infects primarily microglia and astrocytes in the brain, whereas JCV infects primarily oligodendrocytes. Although HIV-1 has been shown capable of infecting oligodendrocytes in vitro (Albright et al., 1996), no instance of viral coinfection of such cells with JCV has been reported. Tat is known to be secreted from cells in which it is made. Here we ask whether such exogenous Tat can influence JCV replication in oligodendrocytes. We find that glial cells infected with either HIV-1 or JCV are in proximity at the outer edge of PML lesions. Exogenous Tat is avidly incorporated into cultured KG-1 oligodendroglioma cells over a 72-h period and is colocalized with endogenous Puralpha both nuclear and juxtanuclear. At concentrations in the medium well below the pM range, Tat stimulates several-fold the replication in vivo of DNA initiated at the JCV origin. These results define a pathway by which a protein made by HIV-1 can directly affect the course of infection by another disease-causing virus."
10004,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become the gold standard treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a serious adverse effect of HAART. The mechanisms underlying NRTI-induced mitochondriopathy involve the inhibition of the human DNA polymerase gamma mtDNA mutations and oxidative stress. The clinical spectrum of NRTI-related toxicity ranges from a subclinical disease e.g. mild hepatic abnormalities, to a rare life-threatening condition with lactic acidosis and hepatic insufficiency. In the latter, liver histology shows massive steatosis. Ultrastructural assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities may be of help to address the NRTI toxicity in poorly symptomatic patients. Efforts have been recently made to assess the clinical relevance of non-invasive tests including the evaluation of mtDNA or mitochondrial functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the diagnosis of NRTI-associated toxicity."
4641,0.005,1.0000,"Tat activation-response region (TAR) decoys have been developed for use in gene therapy for people infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). When a TAR RNA decoy is overexpressed, it will bind Tat, thus leaving less of this crucial protein to bind to and activate the natural transcriptional promoter of HIV-1. Previous TAR decoy constructs have used HIV-1 TAR. However, recent epidemiological and biological data began to suggest that the TAR region from the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) may suppress HIV-1 transcription and hence replication. We created a vector which overexpresses TAR-2 under the control of the human U6 small nuclear RNA gene promoter and here show that the U6-TAR-2 decoy construct potently inhibits both HIV-2 and HIV-1 gene expression. Further, this decoy construct is able to markedly suppress HIV-1 replication. Thus, we have directly proven that TAR-2 can suppress HIV-1 replication and suggest that the HIV-2 TAR decoy may prove useful for combating HIV-1 infection."
4104,0.005,1.0000,"Mechanisms underlying the lipodystrophy syndrome associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection are not completely understood. We investigated the effect of ART on blood lipid concentrations in the fasting state and after consumption of a meal containing [1-13C]palmitic acid in HIV-positive men receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI, n 7), NRTI combined with protease inhibitors (PI; NRTIPI, n 6), in HIV-positive but therapy-naïve men (noART, n 5) and in HIV-seronegative men (controls, n 6). HIV-positive subjects had higher fasting TAG concentrations and resting energy expenditure than controls. Subjects receiving NRTIPI therapy had higher fasting NEFA concentrations than the other groups. There were no significant differences in postprandial lipid metabolism between noART subjects and controls. NRTI therapy impaired hydrolysis of meal-derived TAG, most evidently when combined with PI (the NRTIPI group). Accumulation of 13C-label in the NEFA fraction was not different between groups. In the NRTIPI group, fasting and postprandial NEFA concentrations were significantly higher than other groups. Postprandial glucose and insulin responses in HIV-positive subjects did not differ from controls. These findings suggest that ART dyslipidaemia is associated with impaired postprandial TAG clearance, which is exacerbated by NRTIPI therapy. If dyslipidaemia is to be minimised in ART, the specific adverse effects of particular combinations during the fed state should be considered."
9894,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical and paraclinical presentation of the disease and its impact in terms of morbidity. Twenty-nine HIV1-infected patients (average 12 years of infection, nadir of CD4 210/mm, including 7 patients with a history of opportunistic infection) with a biopsy-proven or likely HIVOP have been followed up for an average of 6.1 years. Modes of revelation of the HIVOP were: cytolysis and/or cholestasis (60%), occult (14%) or symptomatic (37%) portal hypertension (esophageal varices 17%, ascites 10%, cytopenia 10%), or fortuitous (8%). Hypoalbuminemia (≤35 g/L) was present in (31%), thrombocytopenia (<150,000 platelets) in 52% and prothrombin rate <70% in 10%. Esophageal varices were detected in 71%. Thrombophilia was present in 23 patients (80%): in head, protein S deficiency (87%). MRI showed in 82% at least 1 morphological abnormality. The average value of the liver stiffness by Fibroscan was 8.3 kPa. During follow-up, there was no radiological improvement, 15 (52%) patients presented with variceal hemorrhage, 10 patients (34%) ascites, 10 (34%) portal vein thrombosis, 7 (24%) an iron deficiency, and 2 (7%) with a protein-losing enteropathy, including 14 patients (48%) with several events. Four patients (14%) were transplanted, 1 (25%) recurred the HIVOP on the graft, and 1 patient is waiting for a transplant.

5417,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Yupik Eskimos in southwestern Alaska, detected in early stages as a result of screening, appears to be more frequently associated with variants of chronic portal inflammation in the noninvolved liver than with fully developed cirrhosis, otherwise common in HBV-associated HCC from other geographic areas. Of 38 patients diagnosed with HCC since 1969, adequate tissue was available from both the tumor and nontumorous liver in 17. Of the 17 specimens, 14 had chronic portal inflammation and three had advanced cirrhosis; 12 of the 14 were from hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. These 12 cases were studied in detail to examine the features accompanying the development of HCC unobscured by cirrhotic transformation. In the noninvolved parenchyma they included hepatocytic nodules as apparent precursors to HCC and, as markers of phenotypic alterations, dysplastic hepatocytes and hepatitis B surface antigen-laden ground-glass hepatocytes. The latter were observed in eight instances and often accumulated in nodules. Parenchyma within 1 mm of the HCC exhibited increased confluent hyperplasia and frequently conspicuous necroinflammation associated with pericellular and periductular fibrosis, which contributed, in addition to fibrous connections between displaced and heavily inflamed portal tracts, to the capsule that was forming in all cases to varying degrees in the pericarcinomatous region. The HCC was uniformly trabecular and in a few specimens, a continuous transition from hyperplasia and dysplasia near the periphery of the tumor to increasing anaplasia in the center could be made out in addition to pressure effects of the HCC. The pericarcinomatous changes, including hyperplasia progressing to neoplasia and necroinflammation, are also observed in experimental models, particularly the woodchuck HCC induced by a hepadna virus related to HBV. Coordinated morphologic and molecular biologic studies on such animal models and on human HCC detected by screening, as for instance in Eskimos, neither complicated by cirrhosis, should elucidate the direction of the evolution of the HCC and the postulated promoting role of the inflammation."

1187,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with hepatitis C virus-related decompensated cirrhosis can benefit from interferon-based antiviral therapy, but the common complication of cytopenia is a contraindication for this treatment. Splenectomy prior to interferon therapy may alleviate this problem. To investigate whether splenectomy improves the efficacy of antiviral therapy, 13 interferon-naïve hepatitis C virus decompensated cirrhotic patients underwent splenectomy between January 2008 and January 2011, followed 1-3 months later by an interferon-based therapeutic regimen (pegylated/standard interferon-α combined with ribavirin for 48 weeks). Ten (76.9%) of the patients developed postoperative complications, which included minor portal vein thrombosis (2/13, 15.4%) and transient ascites (8/13, 61.5%). At one-month post-splenectomy, the patients showed significantly increased platelet (pre-surgery: 48.2±15.9 vs. 186.0±70.6×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) and leukocyte (2.1±0.5 vs. 5.7±1.4×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) counts. Eight (61.5%) of the patients achieved sustained virological response, including all HCV genotype 2a-infected patients (4/4, 100%) and some of the genotype 1b-infected patients (4/9, 44.4%). Temporary interferon-α suspension was required for one patient to address severe intestinal infection. These results indicate that splenectomy prior to interferon-based therapy was safe and may facilitate adherence to subsequent antiviral therapy in selected HCV cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism.

6249,0.005,1.0000,"Rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) develop a syndrome very similar to patients with acquired immune deficiency (AIDS), including liver disease. This prospective study was undertaken to define the pathology, course, and pathogenesis of liver disease in 20 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) after intravenous inoculation with the standardized isolate SIV/DeltaB670. Tissue samples from liver and gallbladder between 2 and 24 weeks after inoculation were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for SIV gag protein p26, and by in situ hybridization with an SIV riboprobe. Histologically there was infiltration of portal tracts and around hepatic veins and venules by mononuclear inflammatory cells, focal bile duct damage, proliferation of bile ductules, and focal lobular inflammation as early as 2 weeks after infection. The severity and extent of these lesions were graded semiquantitatively and showed that bile duct damage and hepatic venulitis were the most significant changes. Simian immunodeficiency virus gag protein p26 and SIV RNA were detected in scattered mononuclear cells in portal tracts and sinusoids, but not in hepatocytes or bile duct epithelial cells. The data indicate that the liver is involved early during the course of SIV infection, followed by persistent changes until the terminal stage of the disease. Our findings suggest that the liver damage in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys is similar to the changes observed previously in AIDS patients."
7643,0.005,1.0000,"The objective of this study is to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge among patients with mental illness in Brazil and to examine individual and treatment setting predictors of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."
9934,0.005,1.0000,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV exhibits extensive genetic diversity and it is apparent that an infected individual contains different populations of distinct viral strains, a large proportion of which has been found surprisingly to be defective for replication. A similar phenomenon has also been observed with some cell lines that are known to produce infectious viral particles but harbor defective proviral genomes. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this phenomenon by cloning proviral genomes of HIV from a cell line that was capable of producing high titers of biologically active HIV particles that readily induced syncytia with CD4+ cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This cell line was found to contain five proviral genomes, all of which, when tested individually, failed to produce replication-competent viruses upon transfection into human cells. However, when a specific combination of two proviral genomes was used in such transfection studies, it was possible to obtain biologically active, replication-competent viral particles that infected and replicated in CD4+ cell lines and induced syncytia characteristic of HIV. Such a result may be due to homologous recombination between proviral DNAs occurring in cells after transfection and/or complementation of replication-defective proviral DNAs. The diploid nature of the viral RNA genome present in the viral particle may enable the persistence of defective HIV genomes."
7094,0.005,1.0000,"Our study assessed the influence of HIV-related stigma on treatment adherence among people living with HIV in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and whether social support had a moderating effect on this relationship. We recruited 128 patients living with HIV from Sansai Hospital, a community hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and collected data through structured interviews. All forms of HIV-related stigma considered in this study (personalized experience, disclosure, negative self-image, and public attitudes) were negatively correlated with adherence to anti-retroviral regimens. Multiple linear regression indicated that total HIV-related stigma was more predictive of treatment adherence than any individual stigma type, after adjusting for socio-demographic and health characteristics. Tests of interaction showed that social support did not appear to moderate the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence. Our findings suggest that community and government efforts to improve public perceptions about people living with HIV might promote treatment adherence behaviors among HIV-positive patients. "
468,0.005,1.0000,"To characterize, over time, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virus-load change in clinically stable patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 RNA levels were measured in serial CSF samples and in plasma samples obtained, during periods of 20 days-6 years, from 17 HIV-infected individuals not receiving antiretroviral treatment. Longitudinal trends were analyzed by linear regression and restricted maximum-likelihood techniques. CSF HIV-1 RNA levels varied within a restricted range (+/-0.5 log(10) copies/mL) around each subject-specific mean. Although 16 of the 17 subjects had CSF slopes not significantly different from zero, slopes that were more positive were associated with lower CD4 counts. In an individual patient, a CSF virus-load change >0.5 log(10) copies/mL may be clinically significant. Furthermore, our data suggest that, if the CSF virus load reflects the size of the reservoir of infected cells in the central nervous system, this reservoir may increase in those individuals with advanced immunosuppression but is stable, over several years, in patients without AIDS."

The rate of vertical HIV-transmission in the German centers is today approximately 2%.

4777,0.005,1.0000,"Genotypic variation among independent isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is well known, but its molecular basis and biological consequences are poorly understood. We examined the genesis of molecular variation in HIV-1 by sequential virus isolations from two chronically infected individuals and analysis of recombinant HIV-1 genomic clones. In three different virus isolates full-length HIV-1 clones were identified and found to consist, respectively, of 17, 9 and 13 distinguishable, but highly-related, viral genotypes. Thirty-five viral clones derived from two HIV-1 isolates obtained from the same individual but 16 months apart showed progressive change, yet were clearly related. Similar changes in the HIV-1 genome did not occur in vitro during virus isolation and amplification. The results indicate that HIV-1 variation in vivo is rapid, that a remarkably large number of related but distinguishable genotypic variants evolve in parallel and coexist during chronic infection, and that 'isolates' of HIV-1, unless molecularly or biologically cloned, generally consist of complex mixtures of genotypically distinguishable viruses."
8654,0.005,1.0000,"Bevirimat [3-O-(3',3'-dimethylsuccinyl)betulinic acid] is the first in a new class of anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs that inhibit viral maturation by specifically blocking cleavage of the Gag capsid (CA) precursor, CA-SP1, to mature CA protein, resulting in defective core condensation and release of immature noninfectious virions. Four cohorts of six HIV-infected adults, with CD4 counts of >200 and plasma viral loads of 5,000 to 250,000 transcripts/ml and not currently receiving antiretroviral therapy, were randomized to receive a single oral dose of placebo, 75, 150, or 250 mg of bevirimat. Thirty blood samples for drug concentrations and 20 HIV RNA measures were collected from each subject over a 20-day period. Candidate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models were fit to individual subjects by maximum likelihood followed by Bayesian estimation; model discrimination was by corrected Akaike's Information Criterion. The bevirimat pharmacokinetics was well described by an oral two-compartment linear model (r(2), 0.98), with a mean (percent coefficient of variation) half-life of 60.3 (13.6) h and apparent oral clearance of bevirimat from the plasma compartment of 0.17 (18) liters/h. HIV RNA was modeled as being produced in infected CD4 cells, with bevirimat inhibiting infection of new CD4 cells thru a Hill-type function (r(2), 0.87). Single oral doses of bevirimat were well tolerated and demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in viral load. The average maximum reduction from baseline following the 150- and 250-mg doses was greater than 0.45 log(10), with individual patients having reductions of greater than 0.7 log(10).

7580,0.005,1.0000,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
4620,0.005,1.0000,"We studied human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection incidence over time in a 16-center cohort of hemophiliacs in the United States and Europe and estimated the most likely date of seroconversion for all seropositive subjects. Five U.S. centers enrolled subjects independent of HIV-1 status, whereas 11 centers preferentially included seropositive subjects. We obtained unbiased estimates of HIV-1 infection incidence rates from the five centers and estimated dates of seroconversion from the distribution seen among seropositives from all centers. In the five-center cohort, infection incidence began in 1978, peaked in October 1982 at 22 infections per 100 person-years at risk, and declined to 4 per 100 person-years by July 1984. Few infections occurred after 1987, and by that time, 50% of the cohort had become infected. Median seroconversion dates for subgroups of all seropositives ranged from July 1980 to December 1983, depending on the dose and type of factor concentrate. Median dates in Europe ranged from September 1981 to March 1983 and reflected the use of products manufactured from American plasma. Infection incidence apparently peaked about the same time that public health interventions were introduced to reduce transmission. These interventions, including heat treatment of factor concentrates and deferral of high-risk donors, have prevented HIV-1 infection from becoming endemic among younger birth cohorts of persons with hemophilia."

Four patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 200/cmm and in 3 patients the CD4+ lymphocyte count ranged from 200 to 400/cmm. Two patients were treated with AZT, 1 with DDI and 4 had no antiretroviral treatment.

264,0.005,1.0000,"We asked whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease plays a major role in the early stages of infection (i.e. from viral entry to reverse transcription) by using various protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, and KNI-272). When assessed in the two-day multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay, involving a single cycle of HIV-1 replication, all protease inhibitors failed to block infection of HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells by HIV-1, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (AZT and ddI) completely blocked the infection. Moreover, when HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis was examined by polymerase chain reaction in HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells exposed to HIV-1 and cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors, a significant amount of proviral DNA was detected, while no proviral DNA synthesis was detected when the cells were cultured in the presence of RT inhibitors. Protease inhibitors also failed to block chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in HLCD4-CAT cells exposed to HIV-1, while RT inhibitors completely suppressed CAT expression. These results strongly suggest, contrary to a previous report by Nagy et al. (1994), that HIV-1 protease does not play a major role in the early stages of infection."
4153,0.005,1.0000,"The Vif protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is important for virion infectivity. Previous studies have shown that vif-defective virions exhibit structural abnormalities in the virus core and are defective in the ability to complete proviral DNA synthesis in acutely infected cells. We developed novel assays to assess the relative stability of the core in HIV-1 virions. Using these assays, we examined the role of Vif in the stability of the HIV-1 core. The integrity of the core was examined following virion permeabilization or removal of the lipid envelope and treatment with various triggers, including S100 cytosol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, detergents, NaCl, and buffers of different pH to mimic aspects of the uncoating and disassembly process which occurs after virus entry but preceding or during reverse transcription. vif mutant cores were more sensitive to disruption by all triggers tested than wild-type cores, as determined by endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) assays, biochemical analyses, and electron microscopy. RT and the p7 nucleocapsid protein were released more readily from vif mutant virions than from wild-type virions, suggesting that the internal nucleocapsid is less stably packaged in the absence of Vif. Purified cores could be isolated from wild-type but not vif mutant virions by sedimentation through detergent-treated gradients. These results demonstrate that Vif increases the stability of virion cores. This may permit efficient viral DNA synthesis by preventing premature degradation or disassembly of viral nucleoprotein complexes during early events after virus entry."
3649,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the five leading causes of cancer death in human. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common etiologic agent of HCC in the world, particularly in areas prevalent for HBV infection such as Asia, Africa, southern part of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Middle East. Risk factors of HBV-related HCC include (1) viral factors-persistent high viral replication, HBV genotype C or D, pre-S2 or core promoter mutants; (2) host factors-older age (>40 years old) at HBeAg seroconversion, male gender; (3) mother-to-infant transmission; and (4) other carcinogenic factors-smoking, habitual use of alcohol, etc. Prevention is the best way to control cancer. There are three levels of liver cancer prevention, i.e., primary prevention by HBV vaccination targeting the general population, secondary prevention by antiviral agent for high-risk subjects with chronic HBV infection, and tertiary prevention by antiviral agent to prevent recurrence for patients who have been successfully treated for liver cancer. Primary prevention by hepatitis B vaccination is most cost effective. Its cancer preventive efficacy supports it as the first successful example of cancer preventive vaccine in human. This experience can be extended to the development of other cancer preventive vaccine. Careful basic and clinical research is needed to develop ideal vaccines to induce adequate protection. Understanding the main transmission route and age at primary infection may help to set the optimal target age to start a new cancer preventive vaccination program. Besides timely HBV vaccination, the earlier administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately after birth, and even antiviral agent during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV are possible strategies to enhance the prevention efficacy of HBV infection and its related liver cancer.

3957,0.005,1.0000,"The role of maternal and pediatric infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and malaria as risk factors for anemia was determined in a birth cohort of infants born to mothers participating in a study of the interaction between placental malaria and HIV infection, in Kisumu, Kenya. Between June 1996 and April 2000, 661 infants born to 467 HIV-seropositive and 194 HIV-seronegative mothers were monitored monthly from birth. At each visit a questionnaire was completed and a blood sample was collected for the determination of hemoglobin levels and detection of malaria and HIV. Anemia was common and increased from 13.6% at one month to 75% at six months and remained high throughout the second half of infancy. Placental malaria, infant malaria, and HIV infection of the infant were all associated with infant anemia in a multivariate model, adjusting for other co-variates found to be associated with infant anemia. The HIV-infected infants with malaria parasitemia had lower mean hemoglobin levels compared with HIV-uninfected infants, or HIV-infected infants without malaria, suggesting that HIV-infected infants are particularly vulnerable to the adverse consequences of malaria at this age. Early detection and prompt treatment of infant malaria and treatment of anemia as part of the study protocol failed to prevent most of the infants from becoming anemic. Although not proven effective in this study, micronutrient supplementation should be prospectively assessed in HIV-infected infants as a means of preventing anemia."
9603,0.005,1.0000,"Between 5 and 10% of adults infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic infection lasting longer than 6 months, which may lead to advanced liver disease. HBV can be classified into six genotypic families: A, B, C, D, E and F, but only genotypes A and D are significantly represented in western Europe, where they account for some 90% of cases of infection with HBV. In the present study, we investigated a possible association between HBV genotype A or D and clinical outcome of the infection. We compared the prevalence of these genotypes in a group of patients with chronic active hepatitis to that of a group with acute resolving hepatitis. In patients with chronic active hepatitis, genotype A was found in 28 of 35 patients and genotype D in only four. The remaining three patients were infected with genotype non-A, non-D. In contrast, genotype D was found in 24 of 30 patients with acute hepatitis, whilst genotype A was found in only three patients of this group. Three were infected with genotype non-A, non-D. Our results show a clear association between genotype A and chronic outcome (Ficher's exact test: two-sided P-value, P < 0.0001). They suggest that HBV genotypes may play a role in the virus-host relationship. Possible mechanisms for such a role are discussed."

The male partners of all HIV-infected women attending the centers were invited to participate in the study. Of the 275 male partners who were tested for HIV and interviewed with use of a structured questionnaire, 51 were excluded because they had other possible risk factor for HIV infection, no established risk factor was found in the index case, or they had stopped engaging in sexual intercourse. Fourteen of the 224 men (6.3%) were seropositive for HIV. At logistic regression, the highest risks of transmission were for men practicing peno-anal intercourse [odds ratio (OR), 4.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-22.2] and for men whose partner had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < or = 400/mm3. No seropositive men were observed among those who were aware of the woman's HIV seropositivity since the beginning of the relationship or were partners of a zidovudine-treated woman. The results suggest that the risk factors described in man-to-woman and man-to-man HIV sexual transmission also operate in woman-to-man transmission."

1441,0.005,1.0000,"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy."
7213,0.005,1.0000,"Up to 30% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who are receiving long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy do not exhibit a marked increase in the CD4(+) T cell count, despite achieving complete suppression of the HIV load. These patients are referred to as ""immunological nonresponders."" When treating immunological nonresponders, the practicing clinician has several questions, including questions about the clinical risk associated with persistent immunodeficiency and about possible approaches to treatment that would provide clinical and immunological benefits. However, tentative answers to these questions require investigations of the mechanisms that underlie the lack of immune recovery, because only the deepest comprehension of the immunological gaps underlying functional defects will allow administration of highly targeted and efficacious treatment strategies. The aim of our review is to provide a thorough assessment of the clinical implications of a lack of increase in the CD4(+) T cell count in immunological nonresponders, to examine the immunological gaps limiting recovery of the CD4(+) T cell count, and to note possible therapeutic avenues, which may offer clinicians guidance regarding how to most efficaciously treat these critical patients."

Some of the secondary pathogens occur with such frequency or are so rare in the non-immunosuppressed population that they have become part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other infectious agents not yet included in the CDC definition are being reported in the HIV-infected population with increased frequency. General observations of the degree of immunosuppression associated with specific secondary infections have been useful in developing classification systems for HIV disease such as that of the CDC. However, the specific alterations in host immunity that promote infection with specific secondary pathogens are generally unknown. Geographic differences in the types and frequency of secondary infections also have been reported. Variation in strains of HIV, effect of malnutrition, lack of appropriate medical treatment, prevalence of virulent infectious diseases, and epidemiologic differences are possible contributing factors. Some infections that seemed likely to be closely associated with HIV infection have not occurred more frequently in HIV-infected patients. This review summarizes the histopathology of infectious conditions in the current CDC classification and highlights some conditions seen in HIV-infected individuals that are not currently HIV/AIDS-defining infections, yet may be seen by practicing pathologists."

Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex.

A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 300 students aged 15-24 years in 5 secondary schools in Moshi, Tanzania. Bonding networks were defined as social groupings of students participating in activities within the school, while bridging networks were groups that included students participating in social groupings from outside of the school environs. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participation in bonding and bridging social networks and self-rated HIV risk behavior. More participants participated in bonding networks (72%) than in bridging networks (29%). Participation in bridging networks was greater among females (25%) than males (12%, p<.005). Of 300 participants, 88 (29%) were sexually experienced, and of these 62 (70%) considered themselves to be at low risk of HIV infection. Factors associated with self-rated risk of HIV included: type of school (p<.003), family structure (p<.008), being sexually experienced (p<.004), having had sex in the past three months (p<.009), having an extra sexual partner (p<.054) and non-condom use in last sexual intercourse (p<.001), but not the presence or type of social capital. The study found no association between bonding and bridging social networks on self-rated risk of HIV among study participants. However, sexually experienced participants rated themselves at low risk of HIV infection despite practicing unsafe sex. Efforts to raise adolescents' self-awareness of risk of HIV infection through life skills education and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk reduction strategies may be beneficial to students in this at-risk group."

5333,0.005,1.0000,"Viral blips, where HIV RNA plasma viral load (pVL) intermittently increases above the lower limit of assay detection, are a cause for concern. We investigated a number of hypotheses for their cause. We assessed HIV RNA, and total and episomal HIV DNA from 16 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine for 3 years, using two assays: a single-copy assay [SCA; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), <1 copy/ml] and the Amplicor assay (LLOQ of 50 copies/ml). Two individuals exhibited viral blips. From week 20 onward, the period where ART had achieved its final suppressive levels, pVL ranged from <1 to 330 copies/ml, except for one individual at the final time. Both assays were 98% consistent (108/110) in assessing pVL <50 copies/ml, but the Amplicor assay registered 56% of samples (19/34) as below the LLOQ that were in the 50 to 1000 copy/ml range as quantified by SCA. pVL changes between successive time points did not correlate with changes in cellular infection as measured through either total or episomal HIV DNA. Changes in pVL were correlated (negatively) with changes in total CD4(+) T cell numbers (p=0.003), naive (CD45RO(-)CD62L(+)CD4(+)), natural regulatory (CD45RO(-)CD25(+)CD127(-)CD4(+)), activated effector (CD45RO(+)CD38(++)CCR5(+)CD8(+)), but not activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) CD4(+) T cells. Patients receiving stable, seemingly suppressive ART can have pVL near the 50 copy LLOQ at multiple time points. The high Amplicor assay error rate around this level implies that viral blips underrepresent pVL being more consistently above the LLOQ. Activation of latently infected cells is less likely to contribute to this phenomenon."

4401,0.005,1.0000,"The efficacy of protease inhibitor drugs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is limited by the selection and expansion of drug-resistant mutations. HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."
8762,0.005,1.0000,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."

HIV-1 is capable of generating phenotypic variants in the face of a variety of selective pressures. The potential to generate variants with reduced sensitivity to a protease inhibitor was examined by selecting for virus growth in cell culture in the presence of the protease inhibitor A-77003. Virus variants grew out in the presence of the inhibitor, and these variants encoded proteases with reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor. Variants were identified that encoded changes in each of the three subsites of the protease that interact with the inhibitor. HIV-1 displays significant potential for altering its interaction with this protease inhibitor, suggesting the need for multiple protease inhibitors with varying specificities."

HIV infects multiple cells in the liver and might potentially alter the life cycle of HBV, although evidence to date is limited. Unique mutations in HBV have been defined in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals and might directly alter pathogenesis.

5506,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), decreases in fitness after a limited number of plaque-to-plaque transfers in MT-4 cells were very drastic. Here we report an analysis of entire genomic nucleotide sequences of four HIV-1 clones derived from the same HIV-1 isolate and their low-fitness progeny following 7 to 15 plaque-to-plaque passages. Clones accumulated 4 to 28 mutations per genome, with dominance of A --> G and G --> A transitions (57% of all mutations) and 49% nonsynonymous replacements. One clone-but not three sibling clones-showed an overabundance of G --> A transitions, evidencing the highly stochastic nature of some types of mutational bias. The distribution of mutations along the genome was very unusual in that mutation frequencies in gag were threefold higher than in env. Particularly striking was the complete absence of replacements in the V3 loop of gp120, confirmed with partial nucleotide sequences of additional HIV-1 clones subjected to repeated bottleneck passages. The analyses revealed several amino acid replacements that have not been previously recorded among natural HIV-1 isolates and illustrate how evolution of an RNA virus genome, with regard to constant and variable regions, can be profoundly modified by alterations in population dynamics."
6971,0.005,1.0000,"The recombinant virus assay (RVA) is a method for assessing the susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) plasma isolates to antiretroviral drugs. The RVA involves the production of viable virus in vitro by homologous recombination of RT-PCR products from plasma virus with a noninfectious reverse transcriptase (RT) or protease (PR)-deleted cloned HIV-1 provirus. In this study, we have constructed RVA plasmids with contiguous deletions in RT, PR, and the p7/p1 and p1/6 gag protease cleavage sites (CS). The deletions in these plasmids allow generation of recombinant viruses with all loci currently identified as important for resistance to anti-HIV-1 drugs being derived from the clinical isolate, including CS mutations that compensate for the reduced fitness of viruses resistant to protease inhibitors (Doyon et al., J Virol 1996:70:3763-3769). We have also used these new constructs to generate viruses with or without compensatory CS mutations, and examined the effects on fitness. In the case of an indinavir-selected virus, fitness was restored close to that of a wild type virus when a vector deleted in the CS and PR was used. With an amprenavir-selected isolate, virus fitness was incompletely restored by including the CS, and this defect appeared to be partially due to reduced infectivity of the virions. We conclude that the CS mutations were required for optimum detection of resistance in the RVA, but that virus fitness can remain compromised even in the presence of compensatory CS mutations."
6130,0.005,1.0000,"Drug-resistant mutants with a methionine-to-valine substitution at position 184 of reverse transcriptase (M184V) emerged within 5 weeks of initiation of therapy in four newborn macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac251) and treated with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine [(-)-FTC] (two animals per drug). Thus, this animal model mimics the rapid emergence of M184V mutants of HIV-1 during 3TC therapy of human patients. One animal of each treatment group developed fatal immunodeficiency at 12 weeks of age, which is similar to the rapid disease course seen in most untreated SIVmac251-infected infant macaques. To further evaluate the effect of the M184V mutation on viral fitness and virulence, groups of juvenile macaques were inoculated with the molecular clone SIVmac239 with either the wild-type sequence (group A [n = 5]) or the M184V sequence (SIVmac239-184V; group B [n = 5] and group C [n = 2]). The two SIVmac239-184V-infected animals of group C did not receive any drug treatment, and in both animals the virus population reverted to predominantly wild type (184M) by 8 weeks after inoculation. The other five SIVmac239-184V-infected animals (group B) were treated with (-)-FTC to prevent reversion. Although virus levels 1 week after inoculation were lower in the SIVmac239-184V-infected macaques than in the SIVmac239-infected animals, no significant differences were observed from week 2 onwards. Two animals in each group developed AIDS and were euthanized, while all other animals were clinically stable at 46 weeks of infection. These data demonstrate that the M184V mutation in SIV conferred a slightly reduced fitness but did not affect disease outcome."

6077,0.005,1.0000,"The number of HIV-1-infected patients harboring multidrug-resistant viruses is increasing. Since new antiretroviral drugs with favorable resistance profiles are limited, innovative strategies are urgently needed. Treatment interruptions can lead to a loss in HIV resistance followed by improved response to reinitiated therapy. The authors report the case of a patient with sustained antiretroviral response for 3.5 years after a 7-month treatment interruption. Concomitant with an increase in replication capacity, multidrug-resistant viruses gradually disappeared during treatment interruption. Resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) was completely lost, and resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was still present when therapy was reinitiated. PI-resistant variants were not detected at four time points after treatment reinitiation. The alignment of the nucleic acid sequences from all different time points suggested that the viruses obtained after treatment reinitiation evolved from less-resistant variants prior to treatment interruption. This was supported by in vitro propagation of the viral plasma population and an individual clone derived from the time point of treatment interruption. This is consistent with a model favoring reversible binding of HIV-1 to reservoirs, as has recently been proposed for follicular dendritic cells. Understanding of this process could help to exploit the reduced fitness of drug-resistant viruses for treatment interruptions."
7242,0.005,1.0000,"The long terminal repeat (LTR) transcriptional promoters of different human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 subtypes were inserted into the LAI molecular clone of subtype B. The viral genotypes represent seven subtypes (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) and one circulating recombinant form (AG). We performed replication studies with this isogenic set of viruses across six cellular environments. This approach revealed strong cellular environment effects, but the method was not sensitive enough to detect small differences in the replication rate between the subtypes. By conducting pairwise competition experiments between the virus variants in six cellular environments, we could demonstrate significant differences in the replication rates of the subtypes and that LTR-determined viral fitness depends both on the host cell type and the activation state of the cell. In addition, we determined the degree of conservation of the transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in the different-subtype LTRs by analyzing sequences from the HIV sequence database. The sequence analyses revealed subtype-specific conservation of certain TFBS. The results indicate that one should consider the possibility of subtype-specific viral replication rates in vivo, which are strongly influenced by the host environment. We argue that the multidimensional host environment may have shaped the genetic structures of the subtype LTRs."
78,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the population and the increasing likelihood that HIV-positive (HIV+) patients may have an extraction, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in this group. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
3572,0.005,1.0000,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a common complication of patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. The aim of the present study, based on a case-cohort design, was to determine the predictive value of follow-up and baseline qualitative plasma CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) values for CMV end-organ disease in 378 patients (158 who progressed to CMV end-organ disease and 220 who did not develop CMV disease). These patients are part of the full AIDS Clinical Trials Group 204 multinational study (1227 patients), a randomized, controlled trial that compared the effects of valacyclovir with those of acyclovir for CMV disease prevention. Baseline PCR positivity was a significant risk factor for CMV disease progression (relative risk [RR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.00). In multivariate analyses, time-updated PCR positivity was strongly associated with progression to CMV end-organ disease (RR, 4.42; 95% CI, 2.87-6.81). Change in cumulative PCR status was informative for the risk of subsequent CMV disease."
8089,0.005,1.0000,"To assess the impact of chronic viral hepatitis on host immune response, we analyzed the incidence of acute rejection and the frequency of infections in 86 patients infected with hepatitis B and C viruses and had developed clinical evidence of chronic liver disease and 1283 control patients who were transplanted at our center during the same period, but had no evidence of chronic viral hepatitis. To compare the mean number of rejections and the mean number of infections between the two groups, we used multivariate linear regression analysis, which allowed us to adjust simultaneously for the effects of 10 other risk variables with potential impact on graft rejection and posttransplant infection. During a mean follow up of 5.3+/-5.2 years, 62% of hepatitis patients and 54% of control patients had experienced an acute rejection (P=NS). The mean rejections/patient in the hepatitis group was 1.3+/-0.14 versus 1.03+/-0.03 in control (P=NS). In the linear regression analysis, the number of acute rejections in the hepatitis group was 0.16 higher than in control (P=NS). With reference to infection, 84% of hepatitis patients experienced an infectious complication in the posttransplant period, compared with 75% in the control (P=0.05). The mean number of infections/patient was 5.7+/-0.73 in the hepatitis group compared with 3.9+/-0.14 in the control group (P=0.002). The linear regression model had shown that the hepatitis group had a relative increase of 1.18 infections/pt, compared with control. Of the different sites of infection, the hepatitis group had a significant increase in bloodstream (0.48+/-0.08 vs. 0.25+/-0.02) P=0.003; pulmonary (0.60+/-0.09 vs. 0.38+/-0.03) P=0.03; and CNS infections (0.08+/-0.03 vs. 0.02+/-0.004) P=0.05 compared with control. Among the different microorganisms causing infection, the hepatitis patients had a significant increase in gram negative bacterial infections compared with the control group (74% vs. 61%) P=0.04. Our data suggest that chronic viral hepatitis is associated with a significant increase in overall infections, and that of potentially fatal infections involving CNS, lungs and bloodstream. Since there is no significant increase in the rate of graft rejection, one could consider a cautious reduction in the doses of maintenance immunosuppressive agents in renal transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The reduced immunosuppression may in turn lower the death rate from sepsis and progressive hepatic failure."

6558,0.005,1.0000,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."
4360,0.005,1.0000,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."
9700,0.005,1.0000,"An assay, specifically optimized to evaluate the anti-HIV activity of antiretrovirals by flow cytometry analysis, is described. As widely used anti-HIV agents, zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV), and as drugs of recent approval raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV), were utilized as reference drugs. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus was prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with purified plasmid DNA and quantified by p24 antigen-capture assay. For infection, CEM-GFP cells were exposed to vehicle or to several concentrations of the drugs for 2 hr at 37 °C before HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to each sample. The adsorption was prolonged for 3 hr at 37 °C. After 72 hr of incubation, HIV-induced GFP expression in infected CEM-GFP cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and expressed as % positive cells. For comparison, p24 production in supernatants was assessed by a commercial ELISA kit. On the basis of IC50 values, the anti-HIV activity, as assayed by this method, was EFV > 3TC > AZT > NVP > DDI > ABC and ETR > RPV > RAL. The comparison between the IC50 values calculated through flow cytometry and p24 production revealed overlapping results, showing that the optimized protocol of CEM-GFP infection with HIV NL4-3 is a suitable method to perform quantitative, rapid and low-expensive screening tests to evaluate the in vitro effect of new candidate anti-HIV drugs."

7610,0.005,1.0000,"Total body x-irradiation has been utilized in the treatment of several human diseases, including leukemia, where it is followed by bone marrow transplantation, and in some autoimmune disorders. Recently, it was reported that total body irradiation appeared useful in the treatment of Friend leukemia virus infection in mice. In this report, the effect of x-irradiation on the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro in CD4+ cells was examined. MT-4 cells and HIV strain human T cell lymphotropic virus Type IIIB were used to conduct this study. Infected MT-4 cells were irradiated at the time of infection or following infection with x-ray doses of 25-300 cGy. Doses of 50, 150, and 300 cGy enhanced HIV replication by 1.6-, 2-, and 4.8-fold, respectively. Irradiating the cells prior to infection also resulted in similar enhancement of HIV replication. This phenomenon was also observed with wild-type HIV isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear and in HIV chronically infected cells. In addition, the enhancement was associated with a radiation-induced increase in intracellular levels of cAMP. The use of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor, H-8, inhibited HIV replication by 65%. These data suggest that in vitro exposure to low doses of x-ray enhances HIV replication partially via a cAMP-dependent pathway."

In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the most common psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discuss the role of dopamine as a link between psychiatric manifestations and the progression of immunodeficiency infection."
7870,0.005,1.0000,"Genetic therapy offers a potentially promising approach with which to combat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections. Several modalities, using protein- and RNA-based systems, have recently been shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication. A single-chain variable fragment (SFv), constructed from the cDNA of a monoclonal antibody to the HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev, has been demonstrated to potently inhibit HIV-1 replication, when expressed intracellularly in an epithelial cell-line (HeLa-CD4). Murine retroviral shuttle vectors, which express the anti-Rev SFv moiety, have now been constructed. HIV-1 infection was dramatically inhibited in human T-lymphocytic cell-lines, CEM and Sup-T1, transduced with these anti-Rev SFv-expressing vectors. This resistance to high levels of HIV-1 expression was demonstrated in both mixed populations and clones of these cells. Of further potential clinical significance, HIV-1 infection was also potently inhibited in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), transduced with retroviral vectors expressing the anti-Rev SFv molecule. These data suggest that intracellular expression of anti-Rev SFvs, or related approaches, may be utilized as genetic therapy, or intracellular immunization, for HIV-1 infections in vivo."
2224,0.005,1.0000,"CXCR4 is the major co-receptor used by X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread. Targeting CXCR4 by intracellular immunization could be of additional benefit to certain HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
4119,0.005,1.0000,"A majority of the human genome is transcribed into noncoding RNAs, of which the functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are poorly understood. Many host proteins and RNAs have been characterized for their roles in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, but there is only one lncRNA, NEAT1, which is shown to affect the HIV-1 life cycle. We profiled 90 disease-related lncRNAs and found NRON (noncoding repressor of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells [NFAT]) to be one of several lncRNAs whose expression was significantly altered following HIV-1 infection. The regulation of NRON expression during the HIV-1 life cycle was complex; its levels were reduced by the early viral accessory protein Nef and increased by the late protein Vpu. Consequently, Nef and Vpu also modulated activity of the transcription factor NFAT. The knockdown of NRON enhanced HIV-1 replication through increased activity of NFAT and the viral LTR. Using siRNA-mediated NFAT knockdown, we show the effects of NRON on HIV-1 replication to be mediated by NFAT, and the viral Nef and Vpu proteins to modulate NFAT activity through their effects on NRON. These findings add the lncRNA, NRON to the vast repertoire of host factors utilized by HIV for infection and persistence. "
590,0.005,1.0000,"Pentoxifylline (Trental), used routinely for the treatment of intermittent claudication, has been shown previously to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factors-alpha (TNF-alpha) RNA in cancer patients and to lead to a general improvement of well being. Increased TNF-alpha levels have been observed not only in cancer patients but also in cachectic patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and TNF-alpha is known to increase the expression of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) via activating its long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, TNF-alpha decreases the therapeutic efficacy of zidovudine (AZT). Here we show a significant decrease in HIV-1 replication by pentoxifylline in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The reduction was proportional to the downregulation of expression of a reporter gene, the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, linked to the HIV-1 LTR in human monocytoid cells. We conclude that patients with AIDS may benefit from pentoxifylline treatment because of its blockage of TNF-alpha-mediated HIV-1 upregulation, from increased efficacy of AZT, and also from improvement in TNF-alpha-induced cachexia."
4570,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by HIV infection and replication in brain tissue. HIV-1-infected monocytes overexpress inflammatory molecules that facilitate their entry into the brain. Prostanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation that result from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Because COX-2 is normally induced during inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated during monocyte-brain endothelium interactions. In vitro cocultures of HIV-infected macrophages and brain endothelium showed an up-regulation of COX-2 expression by both cell types. This up-regulation occurs via an interleukin-1beta (IL1beta)-dependent mechanism in macrophages and via an IL-1beta-independent mechanism in endothelial cells. Thus, interactions between HIV-infected monocytes and brain endothelium result in COX-2 expression and, as such, might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection."
934,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the sixth most common cancer worldwide. To explore potential biomarkers for HCC, iTRAQ coupled with mass spectrometry was used to analyze proteins in plasma from individuals with HBV-associated HCC, nonmalignant cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis B, and healthy individuals. Twenty-one aberrantly expressed proteins were identified from HCC patients as compared with nontumor controls. Overexpression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) was confirmed by Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analysis from liver biopsies and ELISA from plasma samples revealed a correlation between vWF expression and HCC clinicopathologic staging. Furthermore, siRNA-induced vWF silencing reduced HBV replication by over two-fold via the interferon-signaling pathway and impaired the invasion and migration of HCC cells in vitro. These results indicate that vWF can serve as a biomarker, and perhaps an alternative target for therapeutic intervention of HCC progression and HBV viral infection."

To investigate whether GBV-C/HGV plays a role among Korean patients with liver diseases, GBV-C/HGV RNA were evaluated in 337 sera by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers derived from 5'-noncoding region of GBV-C/HGV genome. GBV-C/HGV RNA was identified in 11/337 (3.3%). They consisted of 1/160 (0.6%) and 10/177 (3.3%) among the general population and patients with liver diseases, respectively (P < 0.01). Nucleotide sequences of all PCR amplicons were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method and analyzed by molecular evolutionary methods. The phylogenetic tree showed all sequences could be divided into three genotypes. These results indicate that: (1) GBV-C/HGV already exist in Korea; (2) GBV-C/HGV may play some role as an etiologic factor among the Korean patients with liver diseases; (3) GBV-C/HGV infection is rare among Korean general population; and (4) there are at least three different types of GBV-C/HGV in Korea."
8436,0.005,1.0000,"To clarify the relationship between aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) expression and early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence, this study detected AKR1B10 expression in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 110 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC underwent liver resection and analyzed its correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of these patients. Detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, AKR1B10 mRNA expression showed significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues, with a low level in normal liver tissues. Similar results was confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. High AKR1B10 expression was negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level and positively correlated with HBV-DNA level. Patients with high AKR1B10 expression had significantly higher disease-free survival than those with low expression within 2 years after liver resection. Multivariate analysis also confirmed high AKR1B10 expression to be a predictor of low risk of early HCC recurrence. In addition, high AKR1B10 expression was found to be a favorable factor of overall survival. These results suggest that AKR1B10 is involved in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis, but its high expression could predict low risk of early tumor recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC after liver resection."
792,0.005,1.0000,"Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests have gained popularity to predict histology in view of the associated risks of biopsy. However, many models include tests not readily available, and there are limited data from patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. We aimed to develop a model using routine tests to predict liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. A retrospective analysis of liver histology was performed in 832 patients. Liver fibrosis was assessed via Ishak score; patients were categorized as 0-1, 2-3, or 4-6 and were randomly assigned to training (n = 555) or validation (n = 277) sets. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that platelet count (PLT), age, AST, and INR were significantly associated with fibrosis. Additional analysis revealed PLT, age, AST, and ALT as an alternative model. Based on this, a simple index (FIB-4) was developed: age ([yr] x AST [U/L]) / ((PLT [10(9)/L]) x (ALT [U/L])(1/2)). The AUROC of the index was 0.765 for differentiation between Ishak stage 0-3 and 4-6. At a cutoff of <1.45 in the validation set, the negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (stage 4-6) was 90% with a sensitivity of 70%. A cutoff of >3.25 had a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97%. Using these cutoffs, 87% of the 198 patients with FIB-4 values outside 1.45-3.25 would be correctly classified, and liver biopsy could be avoided in 71% of the validation group. In conclusion, noninvasive tests can accurately predict hepatic fibrosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy in the majority of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
7273,0.005,1.0000,"The use of all potent drugs is associated with toxicities and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs are no exception. Antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic toxicity is of increasing concern in the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Liver toxicity has been reported in some HIV-infected patients being treated with drugs from all of these classes of ARV drugs: protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Although the majority of cases involve asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), severe, and, in a minority of cases, life threatening, liver disease has been reported in patients treated with ARV drugs. The exact causes of elevated plasma levels of AST and ALT are complex and, in many cases, obscure. The combination of viral hepatic disease, drugs that act adversely directly on the liver and drugs that act on other systems of the body which in turn, adversely affect the liver, can result in hepatic toxicity. Such toxicity may be inappropriately attributed solely to the direct effect of a drug. Knowledge of the possible causes of liver toxicity, and ways to avoid it, should reduce the risk of developing hepatotoxicity. The physician's task is to prevent the development of liver toxicity, e.g., by choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens and by careful management of the patient. This involves frequent monitoring of the patient, both clinically and by utilizing liver function tests on a regular basis. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do develop, prompt and expert management is essential. This review discusses the influence of a number of factors on hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, insulin resistance and the specific ARV drugs used in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS."

The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."

All four inoculated animals showed histopathological evidence of viral hepatitis, and all demonstrated significant ALT elevations between seven and one-half weeks after inoculation. Acute-phase plasma from one of the infected chimpanzees (no. 771) was shown to induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in two other chimpanzees approximately three weeks after their inoculation. In addition, an acute-phase open liver wedge biopsy obtained from animal no. 771 was processed and examined by immune electron microscopy (IEM) for virus-like particles with convalescent serum from a serologically confirmed case of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Twenty-five to 30 nm (mean = 27 nm) diameter virus-like particles that were either ""full"" or ""empty"" were identified in this liver preparation by IEM. Two additional chimpanzees inoculated with a cesium chloride gradient fraction of an isopycnically banded liver homogenate (animal no. 771) also developed elevated ALT activity two to two and one-half weeks later. Our findings have experimentally verified that commercially produced factor VIII materials can induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in champanzees and that the disease can be subpassaged in these animals by inoculation of either acute-phase plasma or liver. These results also provide evidence for the association of 27 nm-diameter virus-like particles with non-A, non-B viral hepatitis."

We report their demographics, attitudes towards assisted reproduction, and ART performance and outcomes. The study included HIV serodiscordant couples (n = 11) who underwent ART at a university-based infertility practice from August 1997 to May 2002. Prior to treatment, couples prospectively completed a survey regarding their demographics and attitudes towards assisted reproduction. All couples underwent ART and pregnancy outcomes were analysed. The majority of the patients were fully employed, college-educated, in good health, married and motivated to have a child while minimizing the risk of HIV transmission. Eleven couples underwent 25 cycles of ART [19 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles; five frozen embryo transfer cycles; and one oocyte donation cycle] resulting in nine successful pregnancies. The ongoing/delivered pregnancy rate per initiated IVF cycle was 42.1% per embryo transfer. Eight of 11 (72.7%) couples achieved a successful pregnancy. More than half (six of 11; 54.5%) the couples conceived during their initial attempt. Four of nine (44.4%) pregnancies were multiple gestations, including three sets of triplets. All female recipients tested seronegative for HIV at 3 and 6 months post-embryo transfer. All delivered babies (n = 8) tested seronegative for HIV at birth and 3 months postpartum. Four pregnancies are currently ongoing. ART should be considered for HIV serodiscordant couples with haemophilia who desire to have children in order to minimize the risk of viral infection."

However, treatment duration is long and some female patients become pregnant during treatment. In recent years, there have been gradually increasing reports on the safety of telbivudine (LdT) treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) of HBV; however, the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy has not been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety of LdT treatment for chronic HBV infection for the entire pregnancy and provide a reference for HBV-infected fertile women on how to block MTIT of HBV. Eighty-six pregnant women who received LdT treatment either before or in early pregnancy were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were prospectively observed for the entire pregnancy and perinatal period, and short-term and long-term follow-up of infants was conducted, monitoring the abnormalities of infants and blocking rate of MTIT with LdT treatment. Eighty-six pregnant women treated with LdT had a total of 89 pregnancies: 6 (6.7%) had early embryonic death or spontaneous abortion, 1 (1.1%) had ectopic pregnancy and three had a second pregnancy after initial abortion. Fifty-one mothers completed pregnancy: one had induction of labour at 24 weeks of pregnancy for cleft lip and palate of the foetus and 50 delivered 52 full-term live infants. One infant had right ear accessories, and the total occurrence of congenital abnormality was 3.8%. Thirty-nine infants were followed up for more than 6 months and completed all examinations for MTIT. None of the infants were HBsAg positive, resulting in a 100% success rate of blocking MTIT. All mothers maintained good liver function during the third trimester of pregnancy; 86% maintained complete virological response (HBV DNA <500 copies/mL) prior to delivery, and none developed progression of liver disease.

4131,0.005,1.0000,"There are few extant studies on the prevalence of HBV infection in couples preparing for pregnancy. We assessed the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in couples preparing for pregnancy in rural China, and the association between HBV prevalence and the statuses of HBsAg/HBeAg and ALT in the spouses. We performed a nationwide cross-sectional study, using data from a health check-up program for 1 936 801 rural couples from 31 provinces preparing for pregnancy between 2010 and 2012. ELISA was used to test serologic samples, and we defined couples who were either discordant or both positive for HBsAg as ""POSITIVE COUPLES"" (PC). Amongst the 1 936 801 couples, 202 816 (10.47%; 95% CI, 10.43%-10.51%) were PC. HBeAg (high infectiousness) was detected in 56 474 (27.84%; 95% CI, 27.65%-28.04%) of 202 816 HBsAg-positive couples. Multivariate models showed that the prevalence of HBV infection in wives increased along with the positive statuses for HBsAg/HBeAg and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of their husbands (adjusted odds ratio increased from 2.31 to 4.98), after adjustment for potential confounders. Similarly, the prevalence of HBV infection in husbands was associated with the positive statuses of HBsAg/HBeAg and ALT of their wives (adjusted odds ratio increased from 2.04 to 4.93). The prevalence of POSITIVE COUPLES in couples preparing for pregnancy in rural China was high, and the prevalence of HBV infection was independently associated with the positive statuses of HBsAg/HBeAg and ALT of the spouses. Instead of solely focussing on mothers prior to becoming pregnant, POSITIVE COUPLES should be taken as an important unit of care."
5077,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem and the world has 350 million carriers of chronic hepatitis B. Over 50 % of these have acquired their infection vertically from their mothers (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]). Majority (>90 %) of vertically-acquired infection results into chronic infection, due to induction of an immune-tolerant state. Hence, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent MTCT would go a long way in global control of HBV infection and the morbidity and mortality associated with it. However, chronic HBV infection in pregnancy presents a unique challenge, because of existence of a complex relationship between the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiological response of body to HBV. This relationship may lead to a varied presentation of the patient to the doctor depending on the period of her pregnancy and stage of her liver disease. Each of these modes of presentation raises issues that need to be addressed for successful maternal and fetal outcome, including prevention of MTCT of HBV. This review will try to give a practical approach in addressing these issues."
9601,0.005,1.0000,"In order to study the relation between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and malaria in women, during and after pregnancy, a prospective cohort study was initiated at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali in Rwanda through routine voluntary and confidential HIV screening in antenatal clinics. At inclusion in the cohort of all HIV-positive and an equivalent number of HIV-negative pregnant women, between 21 and 28 weeks of gestation, sociodemographic characteristics and medical history during the current pregnancy were collected; screening for malaria (tick blood smear) and anemia and a CD4 lymphocyte count were systematically performed. Each woman enrolled had a monthly follow-up until 6 months after delivery. A clinic was implemented that was accessible and free of charge to every woman during the study period between scheduled visits. Malaria infection was systematically screened in case of fever or other compatible symptoms. The cohort included 228 HIV-positive and 229 HIV-negative women. At inclusion, malaria prevalence was 8.0% in HIV-positive women and 3.5% in HIV-negative women (P < 0.04). Over the study period, the incidence of malaria was 6.2 per 100 women-months in the HIV-positive group and 3.5 in the HIV-negative group (relative risk [RR] = 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.3). The bulk of the difference occurred postpartum. The Kaplan-Meier 9-month probability of remaining free of malaria infection was 51.8% in HIV-positive women and 65.2% in HIV-negative women (P = 0.013). When taking account in the same multivariate model (including HIV infection, primiparity, CD4 lymphocytes, anemia, and education level), positive HIV serostatus remained the only factor significantly associated with malaria infection (RR = 1.4, CI = 1.1-1.6; P = 0.016). Our study prospectively documents the association between malaria and maternal HIV infection and highlights the increased risk of malaria occurrence in all HIV-infected women. Strategies to reduce the malaria morbidity during pregnancy should be reinforced in areas of high HIV seroprevalence."
3718,0.005,1.0000,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."

7747,0.005,1.0000,"An evolving dominance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C (HIV-1C) in the AIDS epidemic has been associated with a high prevalence of HIV-1C infection in the southern African countries and with an expanding epidemic in India and China. Understanding the molecular phylogeny and genetic diversity of HIV-1C viruses may be important for the design and evaluation of an HIV vaccine for ultimate use in the developing world. In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships (i) between 73 non-recombinant HIV-1C near-full-length genome sequences, including 51 isolates from Botswana; (ii) between HIV-1C consensus sequences that represent different geographic subsets; and (iii) between specific isolates and consensus sequences. Based on the phylogenetic analyses of 73 near-full-length genomes, 16 ""lineages"" (a term that is used hereafter for discussion purposes and does not imply taxonomic standing) were identified within HIV-1C. The lineages were supported by high bootstrap values in maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses and were confirmed by the maximum-likelihood method. The nucleotide diversity between the 73 HIV-1C isolates (mean value of 8.93%; range, 2.9 to 11.7%) was significantly higher than the diversity of the samples to the consensus sequence (mean value of 4.86%; range, 3.3 to 7.2%, P < 0.0001). The translated amino acid distances to the consensus sequence were significantly lower than distances between samples within all HIV-1C proteins. The consensus sequences of HIV-1C proteins accompanied by amino acid frequencies were presented (that of Gag is presented in this work; those of Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat, Rev, Vpu, Env, and Nef are presented elsewhere [http://www.aids.harvard.edu/lab_research/concensus_sequence.htm]). Additionally, in the promoter region three NF-kappa B sites (GGGRNNYYCC) were identified within the consensus sequences of the entire set or any subset of HIV-1C isolates. This study suggests that the consensus sequence approach could overcome the high genetic diversity of HIV-1C and facilitate an AIDS vaccine design, particularly if the assumption that an HIV-1C antigen with a more extensive match to the circulating viruses is likely to be more efficacious is proven in efficacy trials."
9090,0.005,1.0000,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
9705,0.005,1.0000,"The development of a vaccine to provide protective immunity to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the virus causing AIDS, would be the most practical method to control its spread. Subunit vaccines consisting of virus envelope glycoproteins, produced by recombinant DNA technology, are effective in preventing viral infections. We have now used this approach in the development of a candidate AIDS vaccine. Chimpanzees were immunized with recombinant forms of the HIV-1 glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and then challenged with HIV-1. The control and the two animals immunized with the gp160 variant became infected within 7 weeks of challenge. The two animals immunized with the gp120 variant have shown no signs of infection after more than 6 months. These studies demonstrate that recombinant gp120, formulated in an adjuvant approved for human use, can elicit protective immunity against a homologous strain of HIV-1."
8603,0.005,1.0000,"Treatment with lamivudine of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the rtM204I/V substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. Here we show that the rtM204I/V substitution, although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against lamivudine. The analysis of 639 HBV whole-genome sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that rtM204I/V is independently acquired by more than one intra-host HBV variant, indicating the convergent nature of lamivudine resistance. The differential capacity of HBV variants to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of drug-resistance mutations depend on the genetic structure of the HBV genome. An analysis of Bayesian networks that connect rtM204I/V to many sites of HBV proteins confirms that lamivudine resistance is a complex trait encoded by the entire HBV genome rather than by a single mutation. These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug resistance."
690,0.005,1.0000,"Anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) ""binding antibodies"" (antibodies capable of binding to synthetic peptides or proteins) occur throughout HIV-1 infection, are high-titered and highly cross-reactive, as confirmed in this study by analyzing plasma from B and F genotype HIV-1 infected individuals. Plasma from individuals infected with clade F HIV-1 displayed the most frequent cross-reactivity, in high titers, while Bbr plasma showed much higher specificity. Similarly, neutralization of a reference HIV-1 isolate (HIV-1 MN) was more frequently observed by plasma from F than B genotype infected individuals. No significant difference was seen in neutralization susceptibility of primary B, Bbr or F clade HIV-1 by plasma from individuals infected with the classical B (GPGR) or F HIV-1, but Bbr (GWGR) plasma were less likely to neutralize the F genotype primary HIV-1 isolates. The data indicate that both B and F genotype derived vaccines would be equally effective against B and F HIV-1 infection, with a slightly more probable effectiveness for F than B genotype. Although the Bbr variant appears to induce a much more specific humoral immune response, the susceptibility in neutralizing the Brazilian HIV-1 B genotype Bbr variant is similar to that observed with the classical B genotype HIV-1."
6604,0.005,1.0000,"Resistance to HIV-1 infection in Europeans is associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for the CCR5 protein that is present in Th2 cells and serves as a coreceptor for HIV-1 R5 strain. A deletion of 32 amino acids from the cytokine receptor prevents infection. This mutation prevails in Europeans and is absent in Africans. However, duplication of a gene that codes for a chemokine that binds to the CCR5 was discovered in Africans (mean gene copy 6 while in non-Africans the mean gene copy is 3). Higher expression of these genes protects T cells against HIV-1 infection in vitro. It should be noted that resistance to HIV-1 R5 variant does not protect against HIV-1 R4 variant. It was reported that a minority of highly HIV-1 exposed African professional sex workers (APSW) were resistant to the virus infection during a 10 years period. Recently, the analysis of the cytokines in the serum of the persistently infected seronegative women revealed that the latter hypo-expresses the cytokine IL-4. Since the molecular events during HIV-1 infection are associated with a marked increase in the levels of IL-4 and IgE in the sera of the infected individuals, it suggests that AIDS is an allergy. Thus, a very low level of IL-4 production may abrogate the virus infection. Studies on the human IL-4 gene revealed that together with the IL-4 mRNA a spliced variant with a deletion of exon 2 is synthesized. The latter is a natural antagonist of IL-4 and when expressed in an individual at a level higher than IL-4, the person will resist a microbial infection (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or asthma. The present hypothesis suggests that the HIV-1 resistant APSWs produce more IL-4 delta 2 molecules than IL-4 molecules. The binding of IL-4 delta 2 to IL-4 receptors on T and B cells prevents their functions and the infection by HIV-1. The implications of these studies are that treatment of HIV-1 infected people with drugs that will block the IL-4 receptors will stop HIV-1 infections and the determination of the levels of IL-4 and IL-4 delta 2 in the sera of HIV-1+ patients will enable to identify the individuals that have a natural resistance to HIV-l/AIDS and those who need treatments."
295,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of resistance to lamivudine has been one of the major stumbling blocks to successful treatment and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The major mechanism of resistance has been attributed to the alteration in the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase due to an amino acid change of rtM204 to V/I and an accompanying rtL180M conversion. A novel mutation pattern in a patient having clinical breakthrough under lamivudine therapy was discovered. The mutant had a rtL180C/M204I genotype and was detected after 2 years of therapy with lamivudine. To characterize this novel variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a vector construct containing the HBV genome. Transient transfection studies in human hepatoma cells with HBV carrying the new mutant demonstrated that the rtL180C/M204I mutant was resistant to lamivudine up to 10 microM. The resistance profile was comparable to that of the previously reported rtL180 M/M204I-containing virus. These observations were further confirmed by generation of stable cultures transfected with the mutant virus."

The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."

Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infection model and normal mouse spleen lymphocyte were used to evaluate the anti-HBV and immunoregulation effects. The DHBV-DNA of serum was detected at different time points by using serum DOT-BLOT hybridization. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the determination of nuclear covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Cytokine secretion was determined by ELISA method. DHBV-DNA were inhibited by hyperin (25 or 50 mg x kg(-1)), while cccDNA of liver could be eliminated efficiently by hyperin (25 or 50 mg x kg(-1), P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The T helper 1 effector cytokine was markedly enhanced by hyperin (25 or 50 microg x mL(-1), P < 0.01). In conclusion, hyperin has anti-HBV activity via multiple targets and pathways, and cccDNA may be one of the important targets."
1369,0.005,1.0000,"Sequences at the ends of linear retroviral cDNA important for integration define the viral DNA attachment (att) site. Whereas determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase important for replication in T lymphocytes have been extensively characterized, regions of the att site important for viral spread have not been thoroughly examined. Previous transposon-mediated footprinting of preintegration complexes isolated from infected cells revealed enhanced regions of bacteriophage Mu insertion near the ends of HIV-1 cDNA, in the regions of the att sites. Here, we identified the subterminal cDNA sequences cleaved during in vitro footprinting and used this structure-based information together with results of previous work to construct and characterize 24 att site mutant viruses. We found that although subterminal cDNA sequences contributed to HIV-1 replication, the identities of these bases were not critical for integration. In contrast, the phylogenetically conserved CA dinucleotides located at the ends of HIV-1 contributed significantly to virus replication and integration. Mutants containing one intact CA end displayed delays in peak virus growth compared to the wild type. In contrast, double mutant viruses lacking both CAs were replication defective. The A of the CA appeared to be the most critical determinant of integration, because two different U5 mutant viruses containing the substitution of TG for CA partially reverted by changing the G back to A. We also identified a U5 deletion mutant in which the CA played a crucial role in reverse transcription."
4489,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."

TB threatens HIV-infected patients before and after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, is difficult to diagnose, is rapidly fatal when it is drug resistant, and is being spread in clinics and hospitals. Research priorities include improved and point-of-care TB diagnostics; TB treatment and prevention during HIV infection, drug-resistant TB, and childhood TB; and optimization of TB and HIV program integration. With new TB diagnostics and drugs reaching approval, research must focus on effectively deploying these advancements. Research must include evaluations of individual, household, health care, and community approaches. Studies must apply implementation science to determine how to increase and adapt effective interventions to reduce TB burden in the context of HIV infection. Investment in this research will improve the lives of persons infected with HIV and contribute to efforts to reduce the global TB burden."
1115,0.005,1.0000,"Integration, an indispensable step for retrovirus replication, is executed by integrase (IN), which is expressed as a part of a Gag-Pol precursor. Although mechanistic detail of the IN-catalyzed integration reaction is well defined, numerous evidence have demonstrated that IN is involved in multiple steps of retrovirus replication other than integration. In this study, Huwe1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a new cellular interactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. The interaction was mediated through the catalytic core domain of IN and a wide-range region of Huwe1. Interestingly, although depletion of Huwe1 in target cells did not affect the early phase of HIV-1 infection in a human T cell line, we found that infectivity of HIV-1 released from the Huwe1 knockdown cells was significantly augmented more than that of virus produced from control cells. The increase in infectivity occurred in proviral DNA synthesis. Further analysis revealed that Huwe1 interacted with HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor protein through an IN domain. Our results suggest that Huwe1 in HIV-1 producer cells has a negative impact on early post-entry events during the next round of virus infection via association with an IN region of Gag-Pol."
2054,0.005,1.0000,"Human DNA flanking sites of eight human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral integrations have been analyzed in isolates derived both from integrations in an infected individual and from tissue culture. Sequence analysis encompassing 80-3000 bp of human DNA on one or both sides of the site of integration revealed that seven of the eight HIV-1 proviruses had integrated directly into or within one nucleosome's distance from an L1Hs or Alu repetitive element. To compare this with the frequency at which human L1 or Alu elements sharing > or = 70% identity with L1Hs and Alu consensus sequences would be encountered at random, > 200 bp from each of 82 individual anonymously cloned segments of human DNA were sequenced: L1Hs elements were encountered in 8.5% of the 82 clones and Alu elements were encountered in 13.4+ by using these homology windows. From these data it appears that HIV-1 integrates into or near L1Hs elements with an approximately 6-fold higher frequency than would be expected if HIV-1 integration events were distributed uniformly throughout the genome. A cumulative binomial probability test shows that there is a 0.26% chance that one would arrive at these figures by chance and puts the data well within a 99% confidence interval. We propose that sites of L1Hs and Alu insertions originally occurred in regions of chromatin that were more easily accessible to the retroposon machinery and that these regions are now acting as preferred integration sites for HIV-1."

The dOTFC-resistant variants that were selected were 10-fold less sensitive than wild-type virus, and cloning and sequencing of the complete reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding region identified the mutation M184V. Studies with mutated recombinant HXB2D virus confirmed the importance of the M184V mutation in conferring resistance to (-)dOTFC in MT-4 cells, although no difference in sensitivity was observed in primary cells. The M184V substitution also displayed decreased susceptibility to (+)dOTFC. Selection with (+)dOTFC also produced variants which were 10-fold more resistant than the wild type, and a novel mutation, D67G, was identified following cloning and sequencing of the RT genes. The D67G mutation was introduced into HXB2D by site-directed mutagenesis, and the data obtained confirmed the importance of this mutation in conferring resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC. Mutated recombinant molecular clone HXB2D-D67G was further selected with (+)dOTFC, and three of six clones sequenced contained both the D67G and M184V mutations, while the other three of the six clones contained only the D67G mutation. Clinical isolates of HIV-1 which are (-) 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant also displayed resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC."
8802,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 subtype C (C-HIV) is responsible for most HIV-1 cases worldwide. Although the pathogenesis of C-HIV is thought to predominantly involve CCR5-restricted (R5) strains, we do not have a firm understanding of how frequently CXCR4-using (X4 and R5X4) variants emerge in subjects with progressive C-HIV infection. Nor do we completely understand the molecular determinants of coreceptor switching by C-HIV variants. Here, we characterized a panel of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) (n = 300) cloned sequentially from plasma of 21 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve subjects who experienced progression from chronic to advanced stages of C-HIV infection, and show that CXCR4-using C-HIV variants emerged in only one individual. Mutagenesis studies and structural models suggest that the evolution of R5 to X4 variants in this subject principally involved acquisition of an ""Ile-Gly"" insertion in the gp120 V3 loop and replacement of the V3 ""Gly-Pro-Gly"" crown with a ""Gly-Arg-Gly"" motif, but that the accumulation of additional gp120 ""scaffold"" mutations was required for these V3 loop changes to confer functional effects. In this context, either of the V3 loop changes could confer possible transitional R5X4 phenotypes, but when present together they completely abolished CCR5 usage and conferred the X4 phenotype. Our results show that the emergence of CXCR4-using strains is rare in this cohort of untreated individuals with advanced C-HIV infection. In the subject where X4 variants did emerge, alterations in the gp120 V3 loop were necessary but not sufficient to confer CXCR4 usage."
5719,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection of the brain causes elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory changes in the striatum. HIV-1-infected individuals who also abuse drugs including the psychostimulant methamphetamine (MA) develop more severe encephalitis and neuronal damage compared to HIV-1-infected patients who do not abuse drugs. In previous studies, we demonstrated that the HIV-1 protein Tat and MA interacted to cause enhanced loss of dopamine in the rat striatum via the destruction of dopaminergic terminals. Since both Tat and MA activate glia and induce cytokine production, we investigated the role of cytokines in the synergistic neurotoxicity induced by Tat and MA using cytokine arrays. Significant increases in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1alpha) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels were noted 4 h following Tat + MA treatment compared to saline, Tat or MA. MCP-1 and TIMP-1 levels remained elevated 16 h after Tat + MA compared to saline or MA but were not different from the Tat-treated group at this time point. Weak, but significant elevations in cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-3 (CINC-3), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3alpha) were also noted with Tat + MA. The interaction of Tat and MA was prevented in mice genetically deficient in MCP-1 with a consequent attenuation of Tat + MA neurotoxicity. Our findings suggest that HIV-1 infection with concurrent drug abuse might profoundly increase chemokine levels in the striatum resulting in enhanced damage to the dopaminergic system."

While interferon alpha is used less frequently to treat hepatitis B today, it is still (in the pegylated or albumin-fused form) an essential component of hepatitis C therapy. The growing number of targeted therapies such as new nucleus(t)ide analogs, HCV protease and RNA polymerase inhibitors and other new compounds has added complexity to the treatment of viral hepatitis. This update summarizes the current standard of care as well as new developments in chronic hepatitis B and C therapy."
7426,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are subject to a spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Recent evidence implicates the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) in the pathogenesis of some of these illnesses, although, the cells infected by the virus have yet to be identified. Using in situ hybridization, we examined brain tissue from two patients with AIDS encephalopathy for the presence of HTLV-III RNA. In both cases, viral RNA was detected and concentrated in, though not limited to, the white matter. The CNS cells most frequently infected included macrophages, pleomorphic microglia, and multinucleated giant cells. Less frequently, cells morphologically consistent with astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and rarely neurons were also infected. The findings strengthen the association of HTLV-III with the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy. In situ hybridization can be applied to routinely prepared biopsy tissue in the diagnosis of HTLV-III infection of the CNS."

However, toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) still represents the most common cerebral mass lesion in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The aim of this study was to evaluate nested PCR-B1 using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to detect Toxoplasma gondii DNA for the diagnosis of TE. A total of 114 samples were evaluated, and 33/44 samples from patients with TE were positive by PCR (sensitivity 75%), demonstrating the diagnostic usefulness of PCR technique. PCR-B1 products were analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 30 samples. Only type I allele at B1 was identified in these samples according banding patterns. This is the first report of evaluation of S1-AS1/S2-AS2 set of primers in more than 100 clinical samples as well as the first genotyping study of T. gondii in Cuba."
4417,0.005,1.0000,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a multifunctional enzyme in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 life cycle and represents a primary target for drug discovery efforts against HIV-1 infection. Two classes of RT inhibitors, the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and the nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors are prominently used in the highly active antiretroviral therapy in combination with other anti-HIV drugs. However, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viral strains has limited the successful rate of the anti-HIV agents. Computational methods are a significant part of the drug design process and indispensable to study drug resistance. In this review, recent advances in computer-aided drug design for the rational design of new compounds against HIV-1 RT using methods such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculations, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophore modelling and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity prediction are discussed. Successful applications of these methodologies are also highlighted. "
348,0.005,1.0000,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
7557,0.005,1.0000,"To investigate the pathogenic role of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC) among human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, 111 outpatients with and 68 without diarrhea were evaluated. Examination of stool samples included the HeLa cell adherence assay and an EAggEC polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers complementary for the plasmid locus CVD432. The pCVD432 genotype, adherence phenotype, and patient characteristics were correlated with occurrence of diarrhea by multivariate analyses. EAggEC PCR and adherence assays were positive in 7 (6%) and 24 (22%) patients with diarrhea and in 1 (1%) and 21 (31%) asymptomatic control patients, respectively. Clinical manifestations associated with EAggEC PCR-positive isolates were nonspecific; EAggEC infections were independent of CD4 lymphocyte counts. Of the pCVD432 genotype, 5 (71%) of 7 were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, and 1 strain was resistant to ciprofloxacin. Overall, pCVD432 PCR-positive E. coli was the most prevalent intestinal organism associated with diarrhea. The adherence assay results did not correlate with diarrhea."

In the present study we report on the case of a patient with a history of drug and alcohol abuse who was sequentially infected with HIV, HCV, HBV and HDV. He died of an overwhelming reactivation of HBV and HDV in spite of a recent interferon treatment. HBV and HDV resumed their active replication after over 20 years of complete latency, that is after long-lasting viral undetectability, when the patient deliberately discontinued his last HAART regimen.

3760,0.005,1.0000,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
5716,0.005,1.0000,"It is generally agreed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication is reduced by hepatitis delta virus infection (HDV) and augmented by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, the precise nature of the interactions between HBV, HDV and HIV is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of HIV infection on HBV and HDV replication, and on histological scores during delta virus superinfection in HDV-positive, chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We studied 38 men and six women, 15 of whom were HIV-positive and all of whom had at least one marker of HDV infection. Serum hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV DNA, HDV RNA, anti-delta antigen antibodies (anti-HD) IgM, anti-HD IgG and hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) were tested for in the serum and liver, respectively; anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies were detected using a second-generation recombinant immunoblot assay. Histological specimens were scored blindly according to Knodell's classification for periportal and intralobular necrosis, portal inflammation and fibrosis. HBV DNA was detected more frequently in the HIV-positive patients than in those who were HIV-negative (25 vs 0%; P = 0.01), while markers of HDV replication (serum anti-HD IgM, serum HDV RNA and liver HDAg) were as frequent in the HIV-positive patients (69%, 40% and 50%, respectively) as in those who were HIV-negative (75%, 52% and 30%, respectively; P > 0.05). By contrast, 31% of the HIV-positive patients were serum HDAg-positive compared to only 6% of the HIV-negative patients (P = 0.001). HDV antigenaemia and anti-HD antibodies usually fluctuated in the HIV-positive patients during follow-up. The mean Knodell score was similar in the HIV-positive (11.5 +/- 3.2) and HIV-negative (10.7 +/- 2) subgroups, as was the mean semi-quantitative index of hepatic necrosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Our results provide evidence that in HDV-positive patients: (1) HIV infection counters the inhibitory effect of HDV superinfection on HBV replication; (2) serum anti-HD IgM. HDV RNA and liver HDAg are not more frequent in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative patients, suggesting that HIV infection has no effect on HDV replication (although the significance of the increased frequency of HD antigenaemia remains unclear); (3) the histological severity of liver disease is not influenced by HIV status."
9900,0.005,1.0000,"Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) always occurs in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."

Because of repeated flares, administration of lamivudine was started in March 2002. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA immediately decreased, but the serum level of alanine aminotransferase gradually increased. Drug-induced hepatitis due to lamivudine was excluded. It was suspected that the progression of liver damage was caused by hepatitis delta virus (HDV), because the patient was positive for both anti-HDV antibody and HDV RNA. Co-infection of HDV should be considered a possibility if liver injury is not improved by lamivudine therapy."
8176,0.005,1.0000,"Two chimpanzees with persistent non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis were superinfected with marmoset-passaged MS-1 HAV. Two control chimpanzees were also infected with marmoset-passaged HAV. Neither animal with persistent NANB hepatitis developed elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, whereas both control chimpanzees exhibited ALT elevations within 3 weeks after inoculation. In addition, both NANB-infected chimpanzees demonstrated a delayed anti-HAV antibody response in which one animal failed to produce detectable IgM anti-HAV. With the exception of one stool, all serial liver biopsy specimens and daily stool suspensions from the superinfected chimpanzees were negative for HAV antigen. One chimpanzee with a chronic HBV infection was superinfected with non-A, non-B hepatitis and was shown to develop elevated ALT activity and hepatocyte ultrastructural alterations accompanied by a marked reduction in the titer of serum HBsAg. Our combined findings indicate that acute and persistent non-A, non-B hepatitis infections are capable of interferring with two distinctly different hepatotropic viruses. These results also suggest that in vitro detection of non-A, non-B hepatitis infection or virus(es) may be achieved by antibody-independent methodologies that employ the basic principle of viral interference."

This prospective study evaluated the effect of initiating use of hormonal contraception on cervical HSV detection. Two hundred women who were seropositive for HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were examined for cervical mucosal HSV by use of quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction before and after beginning the use of hormonal contraceptives. Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16.0%) before initiating and in 25 women (12.5%) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P=.4). There were no significant differences in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting combination oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cervical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was -313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV."

We describe a case of HSV-1 hepatitis after primary infection occurring in the postoperative days after a pancreas-kidney transplantation. The patient presented with an unusual evolution of a persistent severe hepatitis associated with a persistent viremia (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) despite an adequate intravenous (iv) antiviral treatment. Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a miliary hepatitis. The diagnosis of HSV-1 hepatitis was confirmed by immuno-chemistry on liver biopsy. The donor was negative for anti-HSV antibodies, excluding contamination by the graft. This case report emphasizes a rather seldom risk of care-associated viral infections, predominantly in immunocompromised patients."
7919,0.005,1.0000,"Persistent B19 parvovirus infection has been recognized in immunocompromised patients, often occurring with a low-titer viremia. In this study, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of B19 parvovirus DNA was carried out on the sera of 49 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-seropositive patients, negative for the detection of B19 DNA at dot blot hybridization assay and with different values of serum anti-B19 IgM (27 patients proved positive and 22 negative). Of the 49 HIV-seropositive samples tested by nested PCR, seven were positive for the detection of B19 DNA. All seven belonged to the group of subjects seropositive for specific anti-B19 IgM. The study shows that, in the presence of specific B19 IgM, circulating virus may still be present but can be detected only by PCR. In that B19 infection can occur with low-titer viremia in immunocompromised patients, PCR may be the only method for virus detection."
254,0.005,1.0000,"Although herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is not regarded as an opportunistic infection, the occurrence of HSE in immunocompromised patients has been documented and the suggestion made that unusual clinical and neuropathologic features characterize the disorder in this population. To further characterize HSE as it affects the immunodeficient, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathological findings in three immunocompromised patients with autopsy-proven HSE. Two patients had cancer (one with lymphoma and another with glioblastoma multiforme), one was known to be human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive and a second was suspected of harboring underlying HIV-1 infection. Two were receiving dexamethasone at onset of HSE. All had fever, mental status changes and new, focal neurological deficits or worsening of established deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was absent or minimal and head computerized tomographic (CT) scans, performed in all cases, were unrevealing. No patient was clinically suspected of having HSE, only one received acyclovir (for concurrent mucocutaneous herpes) and HSE played a major role in all deaths. Autopsy revealed an unusual form of HSE characterized by a noninflammatory, pseudoischemic histological presentation and the unexpected persistence of viral antigens in abundance despite survival beyond the clinical stage during which inflammatory responses usually peak and productive brain infection wanes. The incidence of HSE in the immunocompromised may be underestimated. Preexistent neurological disease, a noninflammatory CSF profile and negative CT scan may confound the diagnosis in this population, a typical clinical presentation notwithstanding. Increased clinical suspicion, the use of magnetic resonance imaging and polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid sequences may permit more rapid diagnosis and treatment. The absence of inflammatory infiltrates in some fatal cases of HSE suggests that an intact immune response is not requisite to the devastating neurological injury characteristic of this disorder."
9245,0.005,1.0000,"Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus has been recognized as a cause of systemic illness in immunocompromised hosts, including relapsing bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Acquired resistance to quinolone therapy, while reported for a variety of bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, has not been previously documented for C. fetus. Two cases of quinolone-resistant C. fetus bacteremia were detected in HIV-infected patients. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the C. fetus gyrA gene in the 2 resistant isolates demonstrated a G-to-T change that led to an Asp-to-Tyr amino acid substitution at a critical residue frequently associated with quinolone resistance. In addition, comparison of the pre- and posttreatment isolates from 1 patient documented outer membrane protein changes temporally linked with the development of resistance. Relapsing C. fetus infections in quinolone-treated HIV-infected patients may be associated with the acquisition of resistance to these agents, and this resistance may be multifactorial."
9430,0.005,1.0000,"Intestinal microsporidiosis has been associated traditionally with severely immunocompromised patients with AIDS. We describe two new cases of intestinal microsporidiosis due to Enterocytozoon bieneusi in human immunodeficiency virus-negative adults. Both patients presented with chronic nonbloody diarrhea, and one had intestinal lymphangiectasia as well. Intestinal microsporidiosis was diagnosed by evaluation of stool samples, and the specific species was determined by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in duodenal biopsy specimens. To our knowledge, this is the first report of confirmation of E. bieneusi in the intestinal epithelium of HIV-negative individuals by use of PCR in duodenal biopsy specimens. Cases of intestinal microsporidiosis in HIV-negative individuals reported in the English-language literature are reviewed. These two new cases along with those described previously corroborate the need to evaluate for microsporidia in HIV-negative individuals with unexplained diarrhea."
9492,0.005,1.0000,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."

Both cases were positive for human immunodeficiency virus-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot methods. Histologic sections from each patient showed a high-grade pleomorphic T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and immunophenotyping demonstrated a prevalence of reactivity for CD4 (helper) over CD8 (suppressor) antigens. T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement studies revealed a rearranged pattern with either the HindIII or BamHI enzymes, whereas immunoglobulin heavy chain genes retained a germ-line configuration. Viral sequences specific for human T-cell leukemia virus-I, human T-cell leukemia virus-II, or HIV-1 were not detected. Thus, although rare, T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be observed in HIV-1-infected individuals."
3275,0.005,1.0000,"The F240 human monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes the disulfide loop-bonded immunodominant epitope of gp41 spanning residues 592-606 and expressed broadly on HIV-1 primary isolates. Despite broad reactivity with native virions and HIV-infected cells, the antibody fails to neutralize infection. However, cytoplasmic expression of single-chain antibody (scFv) directed against gp41 of HIV-1 provides a rationale means to inhibit the maturation of envelope protein. The variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain of human monoclonal antibody were amplified by PCR and linked by a 15 amino acid (GGSGS)3 linker in an orientation of VL-linker-VH and retroviral expression vectors were constructed to simultaneously express F240 scFv and eGFP to facilitate selection of scFv-producing cells. Incorporation of a human immunoglobulin signal sequence directed secretion of the F240 scFv (s-scFv) while an otherwise identical vector lacked this sequence (scFv) resulting in intracellular expression of scFv. Transduced human CD4+ H9 T cells were challenged with HIV. While both secreted and nonsecreted F240 scFv inhibited viral production, secretory F240 scFv was more potent. Thus, this novel approach to direct expression of a nonneutralizing scFv using the Ig signal sequence suggests that targeted therapy using antibodies to conserved, highly expressed epitopes may result in a decrease in viral production due to a reduction of viral assembly and/or transport and expression."

HBeAg-positive patients had significantly (alpha = 0.05) more frequently pathological initial values of biochemical and immunological indicators, as compared with anti-HBe-positive patients. Delta antigen in the liver and anti-delta antibodies in serum if examined, were always negative. All patients were subjected to 16-week treatment with Essentiale forte (Natterman). After treatment and after the subsequent 16 weeks in none of the patients loss of HBsAg or seroconversion of HBeAg-positive to anti-HBe-positive was recorded. In the sub-group of HBeAg-positive subjects after treatment a significant drop of gamma-globulins and circulating immunocomplexes occurred, in the sub-group of anti-HBe-positive subjects a significant rise of active and total T-lymphocytes was found. The authors recommend to test Essentiale forte in the prevention and treatment of immunocomplex disease in chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus."

The 2.3 per cent positivity in the test group and the 8 per cent positivity in the control group did not suggest the involvement of hepatitis-B virus (HBV), as an influencing or associated agent. When 48 patients with glomerulonephropathies and 23 controls were screened for liver cell membrane (LMA) and renal cell membrane antibodies (RMA) by indirect immunofluorescent technique using isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells, 79.2 per cent LMA positivity was seen in the HBsAg positive group and 41.7 per cent in the negative group and RMA positivity was 58 per cent in the positive group and 25 per cent in the negative group. Simultaneous positivity for both LMA and RMA was recorded in 50 per cent of the HBsAg positive patients and 15.7 per cent of the negative ones. The results suggest the possibility of an organ specific autoimmune trigger more frequently in HBV associated glomerulonephropathy."
3214,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence of occult hepatitis B, defined by absence of HBsAg and HBV DNA, ranges widely in patients with hepatitis C. This may influence the treatment of hepatitis C and the severity of liver disease. Sensitive and specific real-time PCR techniques are available commercially and can detect more reliably low HBV DNA levels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection using the COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) in the serum and liver of HBsAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate its clinical consequences on liver pathology and its impact on the response to treatment with peg-IFNalpha and Ribavirin. HBV DNA detection was assessed retrospectively on 140 sera and 113 liver biopsies of HCV positive/HBsAg negative patients before treatment. A 4.4% (5/113) prevalence of occult hepatitis B was recorded in liver samples and in none of the sera. Anti-HBc was not detected in one, three of whom were sustained virological responders to treatment, one was relapsed responder and one was non-responder. Furthermore, in this cohort composed of 12% anti-HBs negative/anti-HBc positive and 20% anti-HBs positive/anti-HBc positive patients, anti-HBc was not associated with pre-therapeutic viral load, ALT serum levels, and histological activity or fibrosis. Using a commercial real-time PCR assay, we observed a low prevalence of occult B hepatitis. This, just as anti-HBC status, had no clinical impact in a large cohort of hepatitis C patients. It therefore does not appear useful to screen for occult hepatitis B in these patients with this test before beginning HCV treatment."
273,0.005,1.0000,"The yield of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (esophago-gastroduodenoscopy; EGD) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients based on presenting symptoms has not been well studied. We studied consecutive patients with documented HIV infection undergoing EGD at a large innercity hospital between August 1, 1990 and December 31, 1993; all had presenting symptoms and indications for EGD prospectively recorded at the time of EGD. All endoscopic abnormalities were routinely subjected to biopsy, and extensive histopathological evaluation was performed. EGD was considered helpful when the findings stimulated specific therapeutic intervention other than antifungal or antacid medications. The specific indications for EGD in 156 patients were as follows: esophageal symptoms, 102 patients (65%); abdominal pain, 18 (12%); upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 25 (16%); refractory nausea and vomiting, 11 (7%). Overall, pathologic findings were identified in 116 patients (74%): in refractory esophageal symptoms, 82%; upper gastrointestinal bleeding, 92%; abdominal pain, 39%; nausea and vomiting, 27%. EGD with biopsy identified a specifically treatable opportunistic disorder other than Candida in 80 patients (51%), including idiopathic esophageal ulcer (22%) or viral esophagitis and/or duodenitis (29%). EGD was not helpful in 22.3% of cases, those involving Candida (12.3%) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD)-related causes (10%). The mean CD4 count of patients with opportunistic pathologic findings (24/mm3, n = 79) was significantly lower than that of patients with PUD/gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (167/mm3, n = 9) or negative EGDs (165/mm3, n = 35). Overall, the results of EGD influenced patient management in 78% of cases. We conclude that selective symptom-specific use of EGD, particularly in patients with esophageal symptoms refractory to antifungal therapy or gastrointestinal bleeding, usually identifies specifically treatable abnormalities, whereas EGD is less useful for the evaluation of abdominal pain or nausea and vomiting."

Only one patient had the wild type sequence. The most prevalent mutations were: 184V (59%), 41L (47.9%), 63P (53%), 215Y (50%), 36I (46%), 10I (35%), 67N (42%), 77I (37%), 90M (36%) and 210W (33%). A positive correlation between the number of previously used ARVs and the number of mutations was observed (p<0.05). Associations between mutations and ARV drugs were identified at positions 69, 118, 184 and 215 with previous exposure to NRTI, mutations at positions 98, 100, 103, 181 and 190 with previous NNRTI use and at positions 10, 20, 30, 46, 53, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, 88 and 90 with previous PI therapy (p<0.05). Previous exposure to ARV drugs was associated with previous genotypic resistance to specific drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV patients. Genotypic resistance was clearly associated with virological and immunological failure."

Incident HSV-2 infection was defined serologically as ""recent"" if a negative result of testing for HSV-2 could be documented within the previous 6 months or ""remote"" if >6 months had elapsed since the last negative test result. The prevalence of HSV-2 at enrollment was 43%. The HSV-2 incidence was 11.4 cases/100 person-years, and the HIV-1 incidence was 5.8 cases/100 person-years. The adjusted hazard ratios of HIV-1 acquisition from exposure to HSV-2 infection were 1.67 for prevalent HSV-2, 1.92 for remote incident HSV-2, and 3.81 for recent incident HSV-2. Recent incident HSV-2 infection was associated with the highest risk of HIV-1 in this study, which suggests that prevention of HSV-2 infection may reduce the risk of HIV-1 acquisition."

We therefore studied EP in HIV-1 infected children with the aim of verifying the association of results with disease progression, clinical signs and electroencephalogram, and individualizing the most reliable test. Thirty-six patients (20 male and 16 female subjects, age range: 10 months to 12 years) belonging to a group of 45 symptomatic subjects seen at the Pediatric Department were included into the study from November 1991 to December 1994. Ten presented with neurological signs as of disease onset, eight others developed encephalopathy during the follow-up. One hundred seventeen EP, i.e., 27 pattern visual, 64 flash visual and 26 brain stem auditory EP, were recorded. Univariate statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test was done. As a whole, we found 22.5% of abnormal EP in subjects without neurological signs and 28.3% in subjects with neurological signs. Results that were obtained suggested a close relationship between both the pattern of visual and brain stem auditory EP exams and disease progression."
1976,0.005,1.0000,"Adolescents and young adults are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection due to unprotected sexual intercourse and drug use. In 1988 and 1989, blinded surveys were conducted in 84 sexually transmitted disease clinics, 115 women's health clinics, and 19 drug treatment centers in 38 metropolitan areas. Blood specimens from 153,242 clients, aged 15 to 24 years, were tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibodies after all client identifiers were removed. In sexually transmitted disease clinics, the median rate was 0.4% among 15- to 19-year-olds, compared with 1.4% among 20- to 24-year-olds. Among heterosexual adolescents, rates in females were significantly higher than in males (Wilcoxon signed rank test). Rates in heterosexuals were highest in the northeastern and southeastern United States and in Puerto Rico. In 20- to 24-year-old male clients in sexually transmitted disease clinics who had sex with males, rates ranged from 9.7% to 55.6%. In drug treatment centers, the median rate among 20- to 24-year-old men and women was 8.3% (range, 0% to 33.3%). Rates in women's health clinics were much lower (median, 0.1%). The high rates of infection in certain groups of adolescents and young adults indicate the need for improved care, education, and outreach targeted toward those at high risk."
3028,0.005,1.0000,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
6836,0.005,1.0000,"The serologic testing algorithm for recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion (STARHS) distinguishes between recent acquisition of HIV infection (seroconversion, on average, in the past 129 days) or long-standing infection. STARHS was offered to sexually transmitted disease clinic patients to estimate HIV incidence and determine correlates of recent infection from October 1998 through December 1999. Of the 5227 patients tested, 116 (2.1%) were HIV infected, and 28 had recent infections. The incidence was highest among homosexual men (5.3%/year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6%-10.0%), those who had HIV-infected partners (8.6%/year; 95% CI, 2.9%-21.1%), and those who had gonorrhea (6.7%/year; 95% CI, 1.5%-20.3%). Among homosexual men, African American (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 1.13-11.55) or Latino (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.11-8.55) race/ethnicity, and having unprotected anal intercourse (OR, 2.98; 95% CL, 1.20-7.45) or gonorrhea (OR, 3.03 95% CI, 1.07-8.63) predicted the predominance of a recent seroconversion. HIV infections in San Francisco may be shifting from white men who have sex with men to men of color who have sex with men."
8508,0.005,1.0000,"We and others have shown that in individual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 is influenced by host immune competence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in addition to selective forces operating within the host, transmission bottlenecks have an impact on HIV-1 intrahost evolution. Therefore, we studied the intrahost evolution of the V3 region of the external glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 during the 3- and 5-year periods following seroconversion after parenteral versus sexual (male-to-male) transmission in 41 participants of the Amsterdam prospective cohorts of homosexual men (n = 31) and intravenous drug users (IVDUs; n = 10) who were AIDS free and had comparable numbers of CD4+ cells. We observed that HIV-1 strains in homosexual men accumulated over 5 years more nonsynonymous substitutions within the V3 loop than HIV-1 strains in IVDUs as a result of lower rates of nonsynonymous evolution in both the initial 3-year period from seroconversion and the following 2-year period as well as a larger proportion of nonsynonymous back substitutions in IVDUs. The mean numbers of synonymous substitutions did not differ between the two risk groups. Since HIV-1 strains in IVDUs could be distinguished from the viruses of homosexual men based on several nucleotide substitutions of which the most conserved is a synonymous substitution at the tip of the V3 loop (GGC pattern), we studied whether the founder virus population itself has an impact on the intrahost evolution of HIV-1. The mean number of nonsynonymous substitutions accumulated over 5 years within the V3 loop was lower in 10 IVDUs infected by the HIV-1 strains with the GGC signature than in 4 IVDUs infected by HIV-1 strains lacking this pattern, while the mean numbers of synonymous substitutions were similar in the two groups."
8699,0.005,1.0000,"Identification of recent infections (RI) may contribute to improve the quality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance, monitoring ongoing transmission and planning and evaluating prevention programs. Our study applied an algorithm combining clinical and serological information to identify RI in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in Rome, during the years 1999-2008, in order to describe the trend and characteristics of recently infected individuals. RI were documented seroconverters, or people with an HIV avidity index (AI)<0.80. Individuals with advanced infection (CD4 count <200 cells/?L or AIDS-defining illness) or with AI ?0.80 were considered long-standing infections. Overall, we observed 2,563 new HIV diagnoses. The algorithm was applied in 2124/2563 (82.9%). Of these, 355 were RI (16.7%). RI was found independently associated with calendar year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[CI 1.02-1.11], for every year of increase), HIV-risk category (men having sex with men: aOR=1.44, [CI 1.04-1.98]; injecting drug users: aOR=1.58, [CI 1.03-2.42] vs. heterosexuals), country of origin (foreign-born: vs Italians: aOR=0.46, [CI 0.33-0.62]), and recruitment site (inpatient vs outpatient clinic: aOR=0.49, [CI 0.37-0.66]). By the application of our algorithm we could characterize the pattern of ongoing HIV transmission, identifying groups needing more urgent prevention programs."
534,0.005,1.0000,"Mortality in HIV-infected patients has decreased dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We analyzed progression to death in a population of 3678 antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from the ATHENA national observational cohort from 24 weeks after the start of HAART. Mortality was compared with that in the general population in the Netherlands matched by age and gender. Only log-transformed CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.61 per unit increase) and plasma viral load (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.60, HIV RNA level <100,000 vs. > or = 100,000 copies/mL) measured at 24 weeks and infection via intravenous drug use (IDU) (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.26, non-IDU vs. IDU) were significantly associated with progression to death. For non-IDU patients with 600 x 10 CD4 cells/L and an HIV RNA level <100,000 copies/mL at 24 weeks, mortality was predicted to be 5.3 (95% CI: 3.5 to 8.4) and 10.4 (95% CI: 6.4 to 17.4) times higher than in the general population for 25-year-old men and women, respectively, and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.25) and 1.29 (95% CI: 1.16 to 1.50) times higher for 65-year-old men and women, respectively. Hence, mortality in HIV-infected patients with a good initial response to HAART is still higher than in the general population."
8481,0.005,1.0000,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."
540,0.005,1.0000,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."

Of this total, 438 tested positive for HIV antibody (1.1%). Of these, 215 men returned for post test interview and physical exam and were compared with 1,348 men randomly selected HIV-1 seronegative men. None of the HIV-1 seropositive had a history of injecting drug use or had received blood transfusion in the past seven years. HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with the TPHA serological marker for syphylis > 1.160 (p = 0.015, odd ratio 1.8), history of urethritis (p = 0.009, odd ratio 1.92) (Table 4). This study found that HIV-1 seropositive men were mostly single, were likely to be from the rural northern provinces of Thailand or Bangkok. History of purchase of low-fee commercial sex and less condom use were significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity as was a history of STD in the year prior to interview. Information on HIV disease and pre-test/post test counselling is needed for Thai laborers who are applying for work abroad to countries which require HIV and syphylis screening. In this effort, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Public Health and the clinic for laborers going abroad should join forces to provide this service. This will serve to increase awareness and self-determination among an increasingly vulnerable segment of the population who also have the potential to spread HIV infection to their spouse and other sex partners.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
3380,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is characterized by high genetic diversity. Current antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance genotyping assays have been designed on the basis of the most prevalent sequence patterns circulating in the United States and Europe, which belong to the B subtype. However, little is known about their performance on non-B subtype samples. In Argentina, circulating forms have been characterized as subtypes B, C, F, and B/F recombinant forms. Our aim was to analyze the association between the genetic diversity of HIV-1 forms circulating in Argentina and the lack of reactivity at codon 74 in an ARV drug resistance hybridization-based assay. Samples taken from 93 HIV-1-infected individuals of Buenos Aires, Argentina were studied. The reverse transcriptase (RT) region of HIV-1 was genotypically assessed by a line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HIV-1 RT; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) and automatic sequencing (TruGene and OpenGene; Visible Genetics, Toronto, Canada). Phylogenetic and intersubtype recombination analyses were carried out, showing that 52 of 93 (55.9%) samples belonged to subtype B, whereas 41 of 93 (44.1%) showed a (5') F1/B (3') subtype recombinant genomic structure. For codon 74 in the LiPA test, 4 of 52 (7.7%) B-subtype samples were nonreactive, whereas 27 of 41 (65.9 %) F1/B recombinant samples showed a nonreacting result, indicating a significant difference in the subtype distribution of the nonreacting samples. The presence of a synonymous polymorphism at codon 72 of RT (AGA --> AGG) associated with the lack of reaction at codon 74 in LiPA, was more prevalent in F1/B subtype recombinant samples (p < 0.001). The present data indicate that HIV-1 genetic diversity is a major obstacle for ARV drug resistance hybridization-based assays."

In contrast, there are at least five different hepatitis viruses (HAV to HEV) that primarily target the liver in humans--called hepatitis viruses, whereas the role of sixth virus (HGV) is doubtful. Although symptoms produced are similar, these viruses differ greatly in their structure, mode of replication and transmission. The aim of this article is to bring out salient features of these viruses and approach towards their control/prevention, laying emphasis on HBV which has attained/ become one of major public health problems in India."
9815,0.005,1.0000,"The major causative agent for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 is a predominant subtype of HIV which counts on human cellular mechanism virtually in every aspect of its life cycle. Binding of viral envelope glycoprotein-gp120 with human cell surface CD4 receptor triggers the early infection stage of HIV-1. This study focuses on the interaction interface between these two proteins that play a crucial role for viral infectivity. The CD4-gp120 interaction interface has been studied through a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis and highlighted as a useful step towards identifying potential therapeutic drug targets against HIV-1 infection. We prioritized gp41, Nef and Tat proteins of HIV-1 as valuable drug targets at early stage of viral infection. Lack of crystal structure has made it difficult to understand the biological implication of these proteins during disease progression. Here, computational protein modeling techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to generate three-dimensional models of these targets. Besides, molecular docking was initiated to determine the desirability of these target proteins for already available HIV-1 specific drugs which indicates the usefulness of these protein structures to identify an effective drug combination therapy against AIDS."
8643,0.005,1.0000,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
5541,0.005,1.0000,"A total of 175 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive intravenous drug users (IDU) with CD4 cell counts of <200 cells/microl were matched with 175 HIV-positive IDU with CD4 cell counts of >500 cells/microl. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) reactivity and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) Western blot (WB) positivity were more frequently observed in subjects with CD4 cell counts of >500 cells/microl. Most of the subjects with low CD4 cell counts and EIA reactivity carried HTLV-2 infection (WB positive and/or PCR positive). No subjects with low CD4 cell counts and a lack of reactive EIA were PCR positive for HTLV-2. Therefore, a negative EIA result can confidently discharge HTLV-2 infection in HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression, whereas PCR should be performed for subjects with a reactive HTLV EIA which is not further confirmed by WB."
5487,0.005,1.0000,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."

The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."

Between April and June 2002, a CD4 count was systematically performed in all HIV+ women (n=221) in 5 antenatal clinics carrying out voluntary counseling and testing. No difference in CD4 count was found in HIV+ women who did not return for their test result (n=50) and those who were informed of their positive serostatus (n=171) (median CD4 count: 389/mm3 vs. 420/mm3; P=0.19). We also found a lack of difference in CD4 count in those who accepted ARV (n=72) and those who did not but knew their HIV status (n=99) (median CD4 count: 405/mm3 vs. 425/mm3; P=0.47).

5930,0.005,1.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to a decreased morbidity and mortality. General practice offers an important window for earlier diagnosis. The British HIV Association produced guidelines in 2008 advocating an increase in HIV testing, with specific references to primary care. This study explores the awareness of, and opinions towards, these guidelines within general practice. An email questionnaire was sent to 191 general practitioners nationwide, in both areas of high and low HIV prevalence. A total of 80 doctors replied, giving a response rate of 42%. In all, 44% of the respondents were unaware of the guidelines and 89% felt comfortable discussing and carrying out an HIV test themselves; of the 11% that did not, all but one were from low prevalence areas (P = 0.037). Respondents felt that main barrier to HIV testing was patient acceptability. Having read the guidelines, 70% believed it would be feasible to follow them in practice. Those who disagreed felt that time implications were the most important reason not to adopt the guidelines. Almost half the respondents were not aware of the guidelines; having read them, the majority felt that implementation is feasible. This demonstrates the necessity for better dissemination of these guidelines. This study found that the main barrier to performing an HIV test was felt to be patient acceptance, a contradiction to findings from recent pilot studies."

The study was done blindly using Shikata et al.'s orcein staining on fixed and frozen material and direct immunoperoxidase on frozen material with antisera specific for surface (anti-HBs) and core (anti-HBc) antigens of HBV. No liver staining could be found in the 98 HBsAg seronegative patients. Among the 28 HBsAg seropositive patients, only 3 showed positive staining: 1 patient with acute viral hepatitis showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc; 2 patients with postnecrotic cirrhosis showed cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, and one of them also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. In contrast, among the 38 chronic carriers, 25 showed positive cytoplasmic staining with anti-HBs and/or orcein, while one of them (with chronic aggressive hepatitis) also showed nuclear staining with anti-HBc. Anti-HBs and orcein staining are equally sensitive and specific for the detection of HBsAg in hepatocytes; discrepant results can be attributed to sampling error of distribution of HBsAg in small liver fragments."

Collections were made in the four metropolitan areas with the highest prevalence of AIDS. Retrospective testing showed an overall anti-HIV-1 prevalence of 16 cases per 10,000 donations. In this study, the predictive value of a negative initial enzyme-linked immunoassay was estimated from both quality control specimens and the rescreening of 13,461 sera to be greater than 99.99 percent with respect to technical error. Among anti-HIV-1-positive persons, there was a 1.3- to 1.5-fold excess of first-time donors. The anti-HIV-1 prevalence among donors showed that infection was more common among young men than suggested by national reporting of AIDS cases. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence varied among the four metropolitan areas less than did reported AIDS cases, but, by 1987, the differences in the latter had decreased. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence in collection areas outside of the four major cities differed much more widely than that among the cities themselves. The TSS/NHLBI Donor Repository will remain available for the indefinite future for further evaluation of screening procedures for HIV-1 and other viruses for which transfusion is found to be an important route of transmission."
7669,0.005,1.0000,"Pharmacological cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors (PCIs) block replication of several viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Yet, these antiviral effects could result from inhibition of either cellular cdks or viral enzymes. For example, in addition to cellular cdks, PCIs could inhibit any of the herpesvirus-encoded kinases, DNA replication proteins, or proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism. To address this issue, we asked whether purine-derived PCIs (P-PCIs) inhibit HSV and HIV-1 replication by targeting cellular or viral proteins. P-PCIs inhibited replication of HSV-1 and -2 and HIV-1, which require cellular cdks to replicate, but not vaccinia virus or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which are not known to require cdks to replicate. P-PCIs also inhibited strains of HSV-1 and HIV-1 that are resistant to conventional antiviral drugs, which target viral proteins. In addition, the anti-HSV effects of P-PCIs and a conventional antiherpesvirus drug, acyclovir, were additive, demonstrating that the two drugs act by distinct mechanisms. Lastly, the spectrum of proteins that bound to P-PCIs in extracts of mock- and HSV-infected cells was the same. Based on these observations, we conclude that P-PCIs inhibit virus replication by targeting cellular, not viral, proteins."
3940,0.005,1.0000,"Neuronal apoptosis within the central nervous system (CNS) is a characteristic feature of AIDS dementia, and it represents a common mechanism of neuronal death induced by neurotoxins (e.g., glutamate) released from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV/macrophage-induced neurotoxicity). Neuronal apoptosis may result from activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial/bcl-2 regulated) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, although which pathway predominates in CNS HIV infection is unknown. Apoptosis initiated by the intrinsic pathway is typically blocked by antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but whether these can block HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis is unknown. To determine the potential role of the Bcl-2 family in HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, we developed a unique in vitro model, utilizing the NT2 neuronal cell line, primary astrocytes and macrophages, and primary CNS HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We validated our model by demonstrating that NT2.N neurons are protected against HIV-infected macrophages by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, similar to effects seen in primary neurons. We then established stable NT2.N neuronal lines that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL, respectively) and determined their sensitivity to macrophages infected with primary R5, X4, and R5/X4 HIV-1 isolates. We found that NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by either R5, X4, or R5/X4 isolates and that resistance was abrogated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. Thus, the NMDA receptor/bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway contributes significantly to HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl-2 family proteins protect neurons against the spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates. Modulation of bcl-2 gene expression may therefore offer adjunctive neuroprotection against development of AIDS dementia."

7900,0.005,1.0000,"The number of patients who present with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease [defined as a helper lymphocyte (CD4) count <50 cells/mm3 or the presence of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illness] is increasing. In the USA during 1994-1999, a relatively stable proportion of 43% of people diagnosed with HIV infection were tested late in the infection (had AIDS diagnosed within 1 year of diagnosis). A recent review of newly diagnosed infections in 2003 found that 301/977 (31%) of patients in the UK and Ireland presented late (<200 CD4 cells/mm3). Before a diagnosis is made, patients with advanced disease do not benefit from antiretroviral therapy and may continue to transmit the infection to others. Furthermore, when antiretroviral therapy is initiated in patients with CD4 counts of 201-350 cells/mm(3), the risk of death is lower than when treatment is started at lower CD4 cell counts. With the increasing prevalence of HIV in women and African immigrants, some doctors are concerned that different management approaches need to be used in these groups. This article reviews the evidence and some clinical scenarios for patients with advanced disease without complications and women and Africans who may present with advanced HIV disease. The aim is to offer practical advice on therapeutic options for treatment-naïve patients who present with advanced HIV disease on the basis of available clinical evidence."
5173,0.005,1.0000,"We performed a population-based cohort study to assess the impact of nonwhite origin on the outcome of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for a Danish cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. A total of 389 whites and 135 nonwhites started receiving HAART before 1 April 2001. After 1 year of treatment, 78% of nonwhites and 76% of whites achieved a virus load of <500 HIV RNA copies/mL. No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count. One year after fulfilling Danish recommendations for initiation of HAART, 91% of nonwhites and 93% of whites had started receiving HAART. Race and ethnic origin play no major role in the outcome associated with HAART if access to health care is free."
7019,0.005,1.0000,"We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine the clinical and economic consequences of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in a health care system with access unrestricted by financial barriers. The analysis was performed from a health care perspective and compared azithromycin (1200 mg/week) with no prophylaxis over a period of 10 years based on data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and randomized controlled trials. The main outcome measures were: expected survival; average health care costs; and cost-effectiveness in 1997 Swiss francs ( pound1 corresponds to about 2.3 CHF) per life-year saved. In patients with an initial CD4 count <50 cells/mm(3) and no AIDS, azithromycin increased expected survival by 4 months. In patients with AIDS, HAART durability had a major impact on expected survival and costs. Incremental survival increased from 2 to 4 months if we assumed a 10 year, instead of a 3 year, HAART effect. The cost-effectiveness of azithromycin relative to no prophylaxis in patients without AIDS was between 47,000 CHF (3-year HAART effect) and 60,000 CHF (10-year HAART effect) per life-year saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased to 118,000 CHF per life-year saved in patients with symptomatic AIDS. In conclusion, in the era of HAART, MAC prophylaxis with azithromycin increases expected survival and reduces health care costs substantially. Starting MAC prophylaxis in patients without AIDS is more effective and cost-effective than in patients with AIDS."
6710,0.005,1.0000,"The last international consensus conference about hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment emphasized the importance of treatment for persons coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As liver biopsy precedes treatment, we aimed to identify factors associated with the performance of liver biopsy among HIV-HCV coinfected drug users during a 5-year follow-up to study their access to HCV treatment. Of the 296 patients followed in the HIV hospital departments of Nice and Marseilles and with retrievable records about HCV diagnosis and care, 166 were eligible for analysis having had detectable HCV RNA at least once during the study period. Overall, 45.2% of patients underwent liver biopsy during follow-up. Using proportional hazard models, predictors of having had a liver biopsy were high social support, complete abstinence from drug injection, and lack of immunosuppression as well as male gender, no history of multiple incarcerations, more recent onset of drug use, and an increase of liver enzyme levels. These results suggest that specific efforts should be devoted to HIV-HCV coinfected drug users to assist with stabilizing these patients to optimize their access to HCV care whenever possible."

Hence, patients with well-controlled HIV infection are no longer prevented from receiving transplants, but treatment must be based on knowledge of pharmacokinetics for the drugs involved. The common approach measuring the cyclosporine level after 2 h or trough level is misleading and it was necessary to determine the area under the curve."

4240,0.005,1.0000,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
4025,0.005,1.0000,"We have used the technique of backcalculation to estimate the number of persons in Canada who have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) as of July 1989. We first corrected national AIDS surveillance data in Canada for reporting delay and for underreporting. We then used standard Weibull natural history models as well as an alternative progression model in which the hazard of AIDS was dampened in keeping with observed data from large cohorts. Maximum likelihood techniques were then used to derive the infection curve most consistent with these data. Our best estimate based on this alternative progression model, an underreporting rate of 20%, and a logistic infection curve, was that approximately 29,000 persons in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. In a sensitivity analysis utilizing less likely assumptions, the estimates ranged from 17,243 to 48,277. Restricting the same backcalculation process to females under the same assumptions, we estimated that approximately 2,900 females in Canada had ever had HIV infection as of July 1989. The best fitting step function infection curve in females appears to be continuing to rise. Given these estimates, it follows that approximately one in ten infected persons in Canada is female. However, females have only accounted for about one in seventeen AIDS cases. These data are in accord with the widespread impression that transmission of HIV to women has occurred more recently and is on the rise across Canada. The current estimate is lower than previous estimates which placed the number of infected Canadians in the 50,000 to 100,000 range. This lowering should not be taken to mean the situation is improving; rather, the early estimates were simply too high having been based on inadequate data and a rudimentary understanding of the natural history of HIV. Backcalculation is an excellent technique for modelling the incidence of HIV infection several years in the past, but it is not reliable for the most recent few years. A significant increase in HIV infection rates may have occurred in the past few years and it would be beyond the capacity of backcalculation to detect. Backcalculation and unlinked cross-sectional specimen surveys together have the potential to provide an effective means of monitoring the HIV epidemic."
7689,0.005,1.0000,"Although their safety and efficacy have been extensively demonstrated, significant underutilization of statins is frequently seen in clinical practice for fears of hepatotoxicity. Research has not only shown statins' safety in patients with various forms of liver disease but also revealed the great benefits conferred by such therapy among liver disease patients. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not an exception. In fact, evidence has pointed to a dysmetabolic syndrome in HCV-infected patients, which places them at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and makes statins a life-saving therapy with excellent efficacy. Furthermore, statins have shown anti-HCV proliferative effects and other beneficial roles in different aspects of liver health, making them excellent drugs with minimal risks. In this review, we have discussed the newly described dysmetabolic syndrome associated with HCV infection, statins safety and efficacy in patients with chronic liver disease with special emphasis on HCV patients, the anti-HCV-proliferative effects of statins and finally, the benefits of statin therapy in other aspects of chronic liver disease."

Fifteen patients received zidovudine (ZDV) and alpha interferon, and 11 patients received ZDV monotherapy. After PCR, the amounts of RNA were quantified by comparing the endpoint dilutions of serum samples with a standard curve with known amounts of viral particles. Before the beginning of the antiviral therapy, HIV-1 RNA was detected in 92% of the patients. After treatment, a fall in the number of viral particles was detected in patients receiving combination therapy (mean titers +/- standard errors of the means, 3,617 +/- 756 pretherapy versus 1,800 +/- 845 posttherapy; P < 0.05) and in patients receiving monotherapy (3,763 +/- 642 pretherapy versus 1,353 +/- 394 posttherapy; P < 0.05).

Virus was obtained during an initial interruption of HAART (hereafter, ""stop 1"") so that DCs could be pulsed. After immunization and a second interruption of HAART (hereafter, ""stop 2""), set-point plasma viral load (PVL; 24 weeks after stop 2) decreased > or =0.5 log(10) copies/mL relative to baseline PVL in 4 of 12 patients. We observed a significant lengthening in mean doubling time of PVL rebound and significant decreases in the area under the curve and the mean peak of PVL rebound after stop 2, compared with those after stop 1. This response was associated with changes in HIV-1-specific CD4(+) lymphoproliferative and CD8(+) T cell responses. These changes were not observed in a group of nonimmunized control patients."
7065,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a serious risk as a disease that can be spread through blood transfusion. Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined in a patient with the presence of HBV-DNA but a lack of HBsAg in the serum and hepatocytes. OBI can be considered as a high potential risk factor for inducing post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several investigations from various regions of the world have reported PTH as well as HCC and cirrhosis among blood recipients with diseases such as thalassemia and other disorders requiring regular hemodialysis. This form of hepatitis also causes complications for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Because of its extreme disease potential, OBI can be considered a high risk for PTH, HCC, and cirrhosis. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of OBI among blood donors is a critical strategy in most transfusion services. This review addresses the recent information regarding the prevalence of OBI worldwide, with an additional focus on Iranian blood donors."

7540,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."

While treatment options have improved substantially over the last decade, responses are still disappointing, particularly in certain difficult-to-treat groups such as patients who are immunosuppressed or have decompensated disease. Preliminary studies have indicated that combined treatment strategies may provide effective approaches for the future. The combination of thymalfasin with pegylated interferon is currently a promising option for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. An ongoing phase 3 study in the USA should provide much needed data to improve the outcome for these patients."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."

66,0.005,1.0000,"In a recent phase II clinical study, 13 chronic hepatitis B-infected patients treated daily with 30 mg adefovir dipivoxil for 12 weeks displayed a median 4.1-log10 decrease in plasma hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA levels. The decline of viral load during therapy displayed a biphasic kinetic profile that was modeled to determine the efficacy of inhibition of viral production, as well as kinetic constants for the clearance of free virus and the loss of infected cells. Viral production was suppressed with an efficacy of 0.993 +/- 0.008, indicating that only 0.7% of viral production persisted during therapy. The initial, faster phase of viral load decline reflects the clearance of HBV particles from plasma with a half-life of 1.1 +/- 0.3 days, translating to a 48% daily turnover of the free virus. The second, slower phase of viral load decline closely mirrors the rate-limiting process of infected cell loss, with a half-life of 18 +/- 7 days. The duration of therapy required to completely eliminate the virus from plasma or suppress it to levels sufficient to induce seroconversion is a function of the half-life of the free virus, the half-life of infected cells, and the efficacy of inhibition of virus production from infected cells. These quantitative analyses provide a more detailed picture of the dynamics of HBV infection and therapy, and can be used to compare the efficacy of various doses and inhibitors of HBV replication for the treatment of HBV infections."
6085,0.005,1.0000,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often manifested with a high level of viremia. The cell types and tissues/organs that contribute to the virus load are thought to be of central and peripheral lymphoreticular origin. The establishment and permissiveness of organ-based cell culture systems from spleen with laboratory strains or primary isolates of HIV-1 have not been reported. We studied unseparated splenic mononuclear cells (SMCs) and adherent cells derived from human spleen and liver in comparison with blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Unstimulated, SMCs were highly permissive to primary lymphotropic HIV-1 and dual/macrophage-tropic isolates (which are able to replicate in both MDMs and PBMCs). Furthermore, SMCs were found to replicate virus to high titer in a rapid log-phase manner and exhibited a prolonged stationary phase of virus production, unlike PBMCs, which required conventional activation with mitogens and exhibited a much shorter period of virus production. Interestingly, the SMCs maintained themselves as a mixed phenotype of nested lymphocytes with complex and well-differentiated macrophage(s) for extended periods of time. In addition, splenic macrophages readily purified by adherence were highly permissive to a dual/macrophage-tropic primary isolate, HIV-1ADA, intermediate with two laboratory strains, HIVR-1RF and HIV-lHXB3, and least permissive to the lymphotropic primary isolate HIV-1Mr452 and two other laboratory strains, HIV-1CC and HIV-1MN. The replication of HIV-1ADA as measured by extracellular p24 was sustained for up to 7 weeks and similar to the replication patterns observed with adherent hepatic macrophages and blood-derived MDMs. This study demonstrates that exogenous stimulation is not required for infection of these cells; either adherence-isolated and/or mixed lymphoid populations can be studied together, and viable stocks can be readily prepared and cryopreserved. In addition, these cells could be used for isolating new and/or other variants of HIV-1. Thus, the use of the SMC primary in vitro cell culture system for future studies involving HIV-1 is warranted."

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary burn care hospital in Iran, retrospectively reviewing the data records of all patients admitted between February 2011 and February 2012. The HIV status of all the patients was assessed in relation to clinical outcomes and the patient's prognosis. A total of 969 patients were included in this study. Five patients (0·5%) were HIV positive, and all of them were male. Mean burn area was significantly larger in HIV-positive patients than the healthy group (P < 0·05). HIV-positive patients had a longer period of hospitalisation than HIV-negative patients (23·2 ± 16·3 versus 13·1 ± 14·6, P = 0·008). Nonetheless, the average number of procedures and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between the study groups (P > 0·05). Comparison of age, sex and burn extent between HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative cases also revealed similar results. Prevalence of HIV infection among our burn population was 0·5%; thus, HIV status may be related with more extensive injuries and longer hospital stays."

6042,0.005,1.0000,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
6094,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."
2844,0.005,1.0000,"This article examines associations between self-perceptions of pain and associated pain distress to gender, ethnicity and religion, health care, health status, and emotional distress. Data were collected through interviews collected in participants' homes. Participants were 151 adults with diagnoses of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Time since diagnosis, health status, health care, ethnicity, gender, religion, and emotional distress were examined as mediators of pain symptoms, pain distress, and anticipatory pain. Almost all participants (83%) reported AIDS-related pain in the last 3 months. Unexpectedly, pain was negatively associated with time since diagnosis with AIDS. Pain symptoms and pain distress tended to vary by ethnicity, with Latinos expressing more symptoms and pain distress than African Americans. Anticipatory pain varied significantly by gender and religion, with women, Catholics, and Protestants anticipating pain more than men and non-Christians. Anxiety, depression, and general emotional distress were significantly associated with pain symptoms (r = 0.44, 0.33, 0.47) and pain distress (r = 0.34, 0.31, 0.34). Health status and health care were unrelated to pain symptoms, pain distress, or anticipatory pain. Pain is a common problem for people living with HIV/AIDS. Self-reported pain is associated with cultural factors and changes in illness status. Clinicians' attention to patients' emotional distress, depression, and anxiety may assist in interventions for pain management."
4236,0.005,1.0000,"Although hepatitis B infection is endemic in southern Africa, a changing epidemiology of the disease has recently been documented in the region. The authors surveyed migrant southern African male mineworkers during 1986 to establish the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B and D (delta) infection in their areas of origin. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was tested in 29,312 adult male mineworkers from 18 geographic regions, encompassing the diverse tribal and linguistic groups in the region, as well as in expatriate mineworkers from neighboring southern African countries. The same cohort was also tested for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Selected hepatitis B carriers were also tested for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), antibody to hepatitis D (anti-HD), and alpha-fetoprotein. The overall prevalence of HBsAg in this survey was 9.9%. However, the prevalence varied from 5.5% to 14% in different ethnic groups. A minority of carriers (4.9%) had replicative hepatitis B infection and were hepatitis B virus DNA-positive. Only 0.6% of tested carriers were anti-HD-positive. Alpha-fetoprotein determinations were abnormal in 1.2% of hepatitis B-positive men. These data show that although chronic hepatitis B infection remains widespread in southern Africa, carrier rates vary significantly from region to region. In contrast, hepatitis D co-infection remains extremely uncommon. These baseline seroprevalence data also establish that HIV infection was, in 1986, a rare infection in the indigenous population of South Africa."

In this country, serological screening of hepatitis viruses B and C is only systematic among blood donors. The aims of this study were; (1) to investigate the reasons for the prescription of the screening for hepatitis B and C; (2) to determine HCV and HBV prevalence among 462 patients attending the Saint Camille Centre and (3) to identify patients with acute hepatitis or with chronic hepatitis for better monitoring. From February to May 2012, 462 patients attending the laboratory of the Saint Camille Medical Centre with viral hepatitis suspicion were screened. The hepatitis B and C serological markers were detected through Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) technique using commercial reagent kits. The clinical symptoms were also recorded for each patient. The results revealed that, the main clinical symptoms that prompted physicians to request HBV and HCV screenings were: asthenia (39.4%), anorexia (21.2%), abdominal pains (19.0%), nausea (10.4%), others (10.0%). The prevalence of HbsAg was 29.4% among the screened people. Patients with acute hepatitis B, active chronic hepatitis B and non-active chronic hepatitis B represented 11.2, 2.2 and 16.0%, respectively. The acquisition of immunity against HBV after vaccination was attempted for 11.7% people. HCV prevalence was 3.9% and its coinfection with HBV was 2.2%.

6685,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of hepatitis E, is an important public health problem throughout the world. There is little information available on the autochthonous HEV infection in highland inhabitants (Tibet, average elevation >3000m) of China. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey to determine the sero-prevalence of Hepatitis E and association of different risk factors in local people and pigs in Tibet, China. For this purpose, serum samples were collected from 600 local volunteers and 453 Tibetan pigs from July 2014 to August 2015. All the samples were examined for the presence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). While socio-demographic and behavioral characteristics were also obtained through questionnaire. The present survey found a close relationship among the HEV of Tibetan people and pigs. The prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was detected 39.33% (236/600) and 42.38% (192/453) in local people and pigs, respectively. There was a significance association of different age groups, ethnic groups, people having contact with pigs or consuming uncooked meat, and gender of Tibetan pigs. Our findings confirmed the presence of autochthonous HEV among people and pigs in Tibet, China. Therefore, effective measures should be taken to prevent and control HEV infection in Tibet, China."

3913,0.005,1.0000,"Using a CD4-capture immunoassay for gp120, several strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) grown in CD4-expressing T lymphoblastoid cells were found to contain little CD4-reactive gp120 (0.3-1.0 ng/ml) relative to virus titre (10(3.2)-10(5.0) TCID50/ml) and p24 antigen (80-1000 ng/ml). The measured CD4-reactive gp120 concentrations of HIV-1 suspensions grown in CD4-negative human neuroblastoma cells were 100- to 10,000-fold greater than those of HIV-1 grown in CD4-positive lymphoblastoid cells, even though both virus suspensions contained abundant viral gp120 as shown by immunoblot assay. It was postulated that CD4 derived from host cells might be associated with virions, concealing the binding domains of gp120. CD4 association with HIV-1 virions grown in CD4-positive cells was demonstrated directly by immunoblot assay of sucrose gradient-purified virus suspensions and by specific co-sedimentation of 125I-labelled OKT4 with virions propagated in CD4-expressing cells. CD4 coating of primary HIV-1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also observed. The biological significance of CD4 coating of HIV particles remains to be determined."
3384,0.005,1.0000,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."

1290,0.005,1.0000,"RANTES has been found to suppress human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. To further elucidate the role of this chemokine in HIV-1 infection, RANTES levels were analyzed in serum and platelet-free plasma (PFP) in 53 HIV-1-infected patients and 20 controls. RANTES levels were significantly elevated in both serum and PFP in all clinical stages of HIV-1 infection, with the highest levels in CDC groups A and B. In longitudinal testing, the progressors were characterized by a pronounced decline in serum levels over time; the nonprogressors, however, had only a slight reduction or an increase in RANTES levels. During 16 weeks of indinavir therapy, there was an increase in circulating RANTES levels and enhanced release of RANTES from stimulated CD8+ lymphocytes. The decline in RANTES levels along with disease progression is compatible with RANTES having a beneficial role in HIV-1-infected patients. The increase in RANTES levels during protease inhibitor-containing regimens may represent a previously unrecognized immunologic effect of such therapy."
3561,0.005,1.0000,"Human natural killer (NK) T cells are unique T lymphocytes that express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) Valpha24-Vbeta11 and have been implicated to play a role in various diseases. A subset of NKT cells express CD4 and hence are potential targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. We demonstrate that both resting and activated human Valpha24(+) T cells express high levels of the HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5 and Bonzo (CXCR6), but low levels of CCR7, as compared with conventional T cells. Remarkably NKT cells activated with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer)-pulsed dendritic cells were profoundly more susceptible to infection with R5-tropic, but not X4-tropic, strains of HIV-1, compared with conventional CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, resting CD4(+) NKT cells were also more susceptible to infection. After initial infection, HIV-1 rapidly replicated and depleted the CD4(+) subset of NKT cells. In addition, peripheral blood NKT cells were markedly and selectively depleted in HIV-1 infected individuals. Although the mechanisms of this decline are not clear, low numbers or absence of NKT cells may affect the course of HIV-1 infection. Taken together, our findings indicate that CD4(+) NKT cells are directly targeted by HIV-1 and may have a potential role during viral transmission and spread in vivo."
1969,0.005,1.0000,"As more effective therapies have produced longer survival times for HIV-infected patients, non-infectious complications of late stage HIV infection such as the development of severe global left ventricular dysfunction (dilated heart muscle disease) have emerged. The demographic and clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who develop dilated heart muscle disease as well as potential risk factors are, as yet, poorly characterized. Of 174 patients enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study, a total of nine patients, all with CD4 T cell counts < 200 mm-3, developed symptomatic heart disease (congestive heart failure n = 7, sudden cardiac death n = 1 and cardiac tamponade n = 1); three of these patients developed progressive cardiac dysfunction leading to primary cardiac failure and death. An additional 55 HIV-infected patients referred to our Cardiomyopathy Service were found to have global left ventricular dysfunction, with 84% having New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure on presentation. Clinical characteristics associated with severe symptomatic cardiac dysfunction included low CD4 T cell counts, myocarditis associated with non-permissive cardiotropic virus infection on endomyocardial biopsy and persistent elevation of anti-heart antibodies. No relationships to any specific HIV risk factor or opportunistic infection were found. These findings suggest that a severe form of HIV-related dilated heart muscle disease is largely a disease of late stage HIV infection. Virus-related myocarditis and cardiac autoimmunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of progressive cardiac injury. Long-term longitudinal studies of larger HIV-infected cohorts are warranted to identify clinical, behavioral and immunologic risk factors."

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed at 6 months of age for 191 HIV-exposed uninfected infants enrolled in a trial of multivitamins (not including vitamin D) in Tanzania. A total of 66 infants (34.6%) were classified as vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/ml), 93 (48.7%) as vitamin D insufficient (20-30 ng/ml) and 32 (16.8%) as vitamin D sufficient (≥30 ng/ml). Independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency were sampling during the rainy season and infant wasting. Infant breastfeeding, maternal CD4 T-cell count, maternal wasting status and maternal receipt of antiretroviral therapy were not associated with vitamin D deficiency. Low levels of vitamin D were highly prevalent among HIV-exposed uninfected infants in Tanzania, and longitudinal studies and clinical trials of supplementation are needed to assess the impact on child health.

Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."
7611,0.005,1.0000,"In HIV/AIDS, symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress may interfere with important self-care behaviors such as the ability to adhere to one's medical treatment regimen. However, these problems may frequently go undetected in HIV care settings. The present study used brief self-report screening measures of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the HIV/AIDS care settings to examine (1) frequency of positive screens for these diagnoses; (2) the degree to which those with a positive screen were prescribed antidepressant treatment; and (3) the association of continuous PTSD and depression symptom scores, and categorical (screening positive or negative) PTSD and depression screening status, to each other and to ART adherence as assessed by the Medication Event Monitoring System, regardless of antidepressant treatment. Participants were 164 HIV-infected individuals who took part in a multisite adherence intervention study in HIV treatment settings in Massachusetts. Available data from 5 time points was used, yielding 444 data points. Participants screened positive for PTSD at 20% of visits, and depression at 22% of visits. At visits when participants screened positive for both depression and PTSD, 53.6% of the time they were on an antidepressant. Those who screened positive for PTSD were more likely to also screen positive for depression. In multiple regression analyses that included both continuous and dichotomous PTSD and depression and controlled for shared variance due to clustering of multiple observations, only depression contributed significant unique variance, suggesting the primary role of depression and the secondary role of PTSD in poor adherence in individuals with HIV."
8986,0.005,1.0000,"Characterization of residual plasma virus during antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a high priority to improve understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis and therapy. To understand the evolution of HIV-1 pol and env genes in viremic patients under selective pressure of ART, we performed longitudinal analyses of plasma-derived pol and env sequences from single HIV-1 genomes. We tested the hypotheses that drug resistance in pol was unrelated to changes in coreceptor usage (tropism), and that recombination played a role in evolution of viral strains. Recombinants were identified by using Bayesian and other computational methods. High-level genotypic resistance was seen in approximately 70% of X4 and R5 strains during ART. There was no significant association between resistance and tropism. Each patient displayed at least one recombinant encompassing env and representing a change in predicted tropism. These data suggest that, in addition to mutation, recombination can play a significant role in shaping HIV-1 evolution."

Some painful syndromes, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated arthritis, may be unique to HIV-infected individuals, whereas others, such as Reiter's syndrome, may also occur in patients without HIV infection but appear more severe in infected patients. Joint and soft tissue pain is usually most intense in the lower extremities. The pathogenesis of the pain is not completely understood but may involve subclinical neuropathic disease."
7725,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that has a worldwide distribution and infects millions of people. Care-associated HCV infections represented a huge part of hepatitis C burden in the past via contaminated blood and unsafe injections and continue to be a serious problem of public health. The present review proposes a panorama of health care-associated HCV infections via the three mode of contamination that have been identified: (1) infected patient to non-infected patient; (2) infected patient to non-infected health care worker (HCW); and (3) infected HCW to non infected patient. For each condition, the circumstances of contamination are described together with the means to prevent them. As a whole, the more important risk is represented by unsafe practices regarding injections, notably with the improper use of multidose vials used for multiple patients. The questions of occupational exposures and infected HCWs are also discussed. In terms of prevention and surveillance, the main arm for combating care-associated HCV infections is the implementation of standard precautions in all the fields of cares, with training programs and audits to verify their good application. HCWs must be sensitized to the risk of blood-borne pathogens, notably by the use of safety devices for injections and good hygiene practices in the operating theatre and in all the invasive procedures. The providers performing exposed-prone procedures must monitor their HCV serology regularly in order to detect early any primary infection and to treat it without delay. With the need to stay vigilant because HCV infection is often a hidden risk, it can be hoped that the number of people infected by HCV via health care will decrease very significantly in the next years.

5872,0.005,1.0000,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
2052,0.005,1.0000,"In a confidential medication adherence questionnaire completed by 255 participants in the HIV Outpatient Study (HOPS) between March and November 1999, 33% reported skipping antiretroviral doses within the previous 3 days.

Twenty-one percent had a history of injection drug use, 12% were unemployed, and 18% had Medicaid insurance. Questions about difficulty taking antiretroviral medications or drug holidays identified an additional 16% of patients experiencing adherence problems and explained significantly more of the failure to achieve undetectable viral loads than simply querying about skipped doses."
4364,0.005,1.0000,"Virologic failure on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with variable changes in CD4 T-cell counts: peripheral CD4 T-cell counts decrease in conjunction with a resurgence of plasma virus (nonresponders) or remain stable or continue to increase despite ongoing virus replication (discordant responders). This study found that HIV-1 isolated from nonresponders had significantly greater replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as an enhanced ability to induce apoptosis in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected CD4 T cells compared with virus isolated from discordant responders. Enhanced replicative capacity in PBMCs of virus isolated from nonresponders was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Virus quasispecies isolated from PBMCs from nonresponders used both CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CX chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) for entry, in contrast to virus isolated from PBMCs from discordant responders, which predominantly used CCR5. In contrast, virus isolated from plasma from both groups predominantly used CCR5. In summary, although drug resistance may lead to impaired viral fitness, the capacity of virus quasispecies from PBMCs to use CXCR4 may have significant consequences on viral replicative capacity and potentially on clinical outcome."
7446,0.005,1.0000,"Recent evidence has suggested that plasma membrane sphingolipids and cholesterol spontaneously coalesce into raft-like microdomains and that specific proteins, including CD4 and some other T-cell signaling molecules, sequester into these rafts. In agreement with these results, we found that CD4 and the associated Lck tyrosine kinase of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and H9 leukemic T cells were selectively and highly enriched in a low-density lipid fraction that was resistant at 0 degrees C to the neutral detergent Triton X-100 but was disrupted by extraction of cholesterol with filipin or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. In contrast, the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, a coreceptor for X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), was almost completely excluded from the detergent-resistant raft fraction. Accordingly, as determined by immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy, CD4 and CXCR4 did not coaggregate into antibody-induced cell surface patches or into patches of CXCR4 that formed naturally at the ruffled edges of adherent cells. The CXCR4 fluorescent patches were extracted with cold 1% Triton X-100, whereas the CD4 patches were resistant. In stringent support of these data, CD4 colocalized with patches of cholera toxin bound to the raft-associated sphingoglycolipid GM1, whereas CXCR4 did not. Addition of the CXCR4-activating chemokine SDF-1 alpha did not induce CXCR4 movement into rafts. Moreover, binding of purified monomeric gp120 envelope glycoproteins from strains of HIV-1 that use this coreceptor did not stimulate detectable redistributions of CD4 or CXCR4 between their separate membrane domains. However, adsorption of multivalent gp120-containing HIV-1 virion particles appeared to destabilize the local CD4-containing rafts. Indeed, adsorbed HIV-1 virions were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and were almost all situated in nonraft regions of the cell surface. We conclude that HIV-1 initially binds to CD4 in a raft domain and that its secondary associations with CXCR4 require shifts of proteins and associated lipids away from their preferred lipid microenvironments. Our evidence suggests that these changes in protein-lipid interactions destabilize the plasma membrane microenvironment underlying the virus by at least several kilocalories per mole, and we propose that this makes an important contribution to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes during infection. Thus, binding of HIV-1 may be favored by the presence of CD4 in rafts, but the rafts may then disperse prior to the membrane fusion reaction."
8276,0.005,1.0000,"To assess dried plasma spots (DPSs) as a source of material for virus quantification, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels were quantified in matched DPS and liquid plasma samples from 73 infected patients, including 5 neonates and 4 adult patients with acute HIV-1 infection. Quantifications were performed by commercially available assays (NASBA [nucleic acid sequence-based amplification] or Amplicor, or both). There was a strong correlation between HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma and DPSs. More importantly, there was no decline in HIV-1 RNA levels in DPSs stored for as long as 2 weeks at 20 degrees C. Similarly, storage of DPSs for 3 days at 37 degrees C resulted in no decrease in viral RNA levels. For patients with primary infection, the DPS method allowed for the measurement of RNA levels in plasma during the initial spike in the level of viremia and in the subsequent period of suppressed viral replication. DPS quantification was equally informative in the neonatal setting, with all five newborns showing HIV-1 RNA loads of greater than 4.991 log10 copies/ml. We conclude that the viral RNA levels in DPSs are equivalent to those measured in fresh-frozen plasma. The ease and economy of DPS sampling, the minute volumes required, and the unexpected stability of dried RNA suggest that the use of DPSs will be particularly valuable for small-volume neonatal samples and large, population-based studies in which cold storage and transportation present special problems, as is often the case in developing countries. The ability to measure viral changes during primary infection suggests that the method will be useful for assessing vaccine efficacy in large field trials."
2495,0.005,1.0000,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."

This study compared concentrations of zidovudine monophosphate, zidovudine diphosphate, and zidovudine triphosphate with P-glycoprotein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients receiving long-term (> 18 months) and short-term (< 2 months) zidovudine treatment."

Of 833 infants born to women at risk of HIV-1 infection, 388 were born HIV-1 seropositive and 445 were HIV-1 seronegative. The four methods, the Antibody Only, Indirect, Direct, and Virologic Methods, yielded transmission rate estimates of 19-25%, classifying 59-89% of the cohort. Estimation based on persistence of HIV-1 antibody and clinical assessment yielded transmission rates similar to those methods that incorporated virologic testing."
5675,0.005,1.0000,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‑infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV‑infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence‑based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV."
4002,0.005,1.0000,"Despite widely available and effective treatments, there are racial/ethnic disparities in HIV-related mortality rates. The reason for inadequate HIV/AIDS management among minority populations is not fully understood, however recent research indicates that patients rate the quality of their health care higher if they are racially/ethnically concordant with their providers. As trust plays prominently on health care ratings, we examined whether racial/ethnicity concordance was associated with two dimensions of trust, trust in the provider and mistrust in the health care system, in 380 HIV infected people New York City. In this sample, concordance was associated with lower mistrust in the health care system, but not with trust in provider. We conclude that in this patient population and within the health care system available to them, racial/ethnic concordance might be more important for helping patients to understand and navigate the health care system rather than in interpersonal relationships with a single provider."
9481,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the association of primary or nonprimary sexual partner relationship status on sexual risk behaviors, including condom use, among Latina women who are at self-disclosed increased heterosexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Approximately 13% of participants reported sexual activities with both primary and nonprimary sexual partners during the 6 months prior to the interview. Primary or nonprimary sexual partner status was associated with significant differences in frequency of condom use during anal sex and oral-penile sex, with more frequent condom use reported during these sexual activities with nonprimary sexual partners. Thus, potential contextual differences associated with primary or nonprimary relationship status may represent important factors to consider when designing interventions to facilitate HIV-protective behaviors among populations of urban women identified at increased heterosexual risk for HIV infection."
824,0.005,1.0000,"Macrophages are often considered as a reservoir of latent infection in HIV+ patients, and their infection may indeed be very important functionally. However, some quantitative studies did not find high infection frequencies in peripheral blood monocytes. Since lymphoid organs are the major site of infection, macrophage infection was tested in spleens removed from HIV+ patients for treatment of different syndromes. Ten replicates of limiting dilutions from different cell populations were submitted to a nested PCR specific to conserved regions of HIV1 env DNA. On an average, 1/2,300 adherent cells carried HIV1 DNA (n = 7; range: 1/55,000 to 1/660). These adherent cells, obtained after two days of culture, comprised the whole macrophage population, with no biases introduced by surface molecule selection, but were not pure (41-78% macrophages). Only 1/37,000 CD14+ monocyte/macrophages were positive (n = 6; range: 1/130,000 to 1/22,000). Therefore, the infection frequency of the isolated splenic monocytes/macrophages from these patients could be estimated at between 1/37,000 and 1/2,300. In contrast, 1/60 CD4+ T lymphocytes were positive (n = 7; range: 1/190 to 1/17). Within the experimental limits, such as cell isolation, required for accurate quantification, this study in the spleen indicates, as have other studies on peripheral blood, that macrophages do not quantitatively constitute an important reservoir of HIV when compared to CD4+ T lymphocytes."
4748,0.005,1.0000,"ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (encoded by ABCB-1 or MDR-1) has an important role in cellular export of antiretroviral agents. A previous study showed that ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism affects plasma efavirenz and nelfinavir concentrations and rate of CD4+ T cell recovery after starting antiretroviral treatment (ART). The present study examined the influence of ABCB-1 polymorphisms on plasma nevirapine and efavirenz levels when co-administered with rifampicin in 124 HIV/TB patients who received nevirapine- (400 mg/day) (n = 59) and efavirenz- (600 mg/day) (n = 65) based ART. ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms were genotyped using real-time PCR. CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral RNA were evaluated in response to ART. The frequencies of CC, CT and TT genotypes of ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism were 34% (n = 42), 55% (n = 68) and 12% (n = 14), respectively. Contrary to the previous report, no association was found among these genotypes and plasma drug concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and after rifampicin discontinuation. We also observed no differences in CD4+ T cell recovery rate among different ABCB-1 C3435T genotypes. In nevirapine group, however, all the patients with CT genotype achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml, while 67% of those with TT and 95% with CC genotypes achieved < 50 copies/ml (p = 0.040). These data suggested that ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms do not affect plasma nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations in HIV/TB co-infected Thai patients or their immunological outcome, but had an effect on virologic outcome in the nevirapine-treated group."
5363,0.005,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that CD8 lymphocytes may represent targets for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo whose destruction may contribute to the loss of immune function underlying AIDS. HIV-1 may infect thymic precursor cells destined to become CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and contribute to the numerical decline in both subsets on disease progression. There is also evidence for the induction of CD4 expression and susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 of CD8 lymphocytes activated in vitro. To investigate the relationship between CD8 activation and infection by HIV-1 in vivo, activated subsets of CD8 lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-seropositive individuals were investigated for CD4 expression and HIV infection. Activated CD8 lymphocytes were identified by expression of CD69, CD71, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, the beta-chain of CD8, and the RO isoform of CD45. CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD8 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, other T cells, and non-T cells were purified using paramagnetic beads, and proviral sequences were quantified by PCR using primers from the long terminal repeat region. Frequencies of activated CD8 lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected study subjects than in seronegative controls, and they frequently coexpressed CD4 (mean frequencies on CD69(+), CD71(+), and HLA class II(+) cells of 23, 37, and 8%, respectively, compared with 1 to 2% for nonactivated CD8 lymphocytes). The level of CD4 expression of the double-positive population approached that of mature CD4 lymphocytes. That CD4 expression renders CD8 cell susceptible to infection was indicated by their high frequency of infection in vivo; infected CD4(+) CD8 lymphocytes accounted for between 3 and 72% of the total proviral load in PBMCs from five of the eight study subjects investigated, despite these cells representing a small component of the PBMC population (<3%). Combined, these findings provide evidence that antigenic stimulation of CD8 lymphocytes in vivo induces CD4 expression that renders them susceptible to HIV infection and destruction. The specific targeting of responding CD8 lymphocytes may provide a functional explanation for the previously observed impairment of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) function disproportionate to their numerical decline in AIDS and for the deletion of specific clones of CTLs responding to HIV antigens."

5070,0.005,1.0000,"The principle of directly observed therapy (DOT) has its roots in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), for which DOT programs have improved cure rates in hard-to-reach populations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB affect similar populations, and there are concerns about both regarding the development of drug resistance associated with poor adherence to therapy. Accordingly, DOT may benefit certain HIV-infected people who have difficulty adhering to highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, important differences exist in the treatment of these diseases that raise questions about how DOT can be adapted to HIV therapy. DOT for management of HIV infection has been effective among prisoners and in pilot programs in Haiti, Rhode Island, and Florida. Although DOT can successfully treat HIV infection in marginalized populations in the short term, a multitude of questions remain. This review provides an account of the preliminary development of DOT programs for the treatment of HIV-infected individuals."
4167,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has had a great impact on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1. However, development of drug resistance, which could be subsequently transmitted to the child, is a major concern. In Honduras and Belize the prevalence of drug resistance among HIV-1-infected children remains unknown. A total of 95 dried blood spot samples was obtained from HIV-1-infected, untreated children in Honduras and Belize born during 2001 to 2004, when preventive antiretroviral therapy was often suboptimal and consisted of monotherapy with nevirapine or zidovudine. Partial HIV-1 pol gene sequences were successfully obtained from 66 children (Honduras n=55; Belize n=11). Mutations associated with drug resistance were detected in 13% of the Honduran and 27% of the Belizean children. Most of the mutations detected in Honduras (43%) and all mutations detected in Belize were associated with resistance to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which was expected from the wide use of nevirapine to prevent MTCT during the study period. In addition, although several mothers reported that they had not received antiretroviral therapy, mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors were found in Honduras. This suggests prior and unreported use of these drugs, or that these women had been infected with resistant virus. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, the presence of drug resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1-infected Honduran and Belizean children."
6211,0.005,1.0000,"Detection of plasma viremia in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected people is indispensable for the diagnosis of seronegative infection as well as for the evaluation of virus activities in vivo. The direct detection of HIV-1 RNA in circulation has been performed by means of reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As an attempt to establish a highly sensitive assay, we evaluated the effects of two-step amplification with nested primers and double priming of reverse transcription on the sensitivity of RT-PCR. The sensitivity of two-step amplification was 100 times higher than that of one-step amplification. The double priming of reverse transcription further increased the sensitivity of the following two-step amplification 100 times, which appeared to be enough to detect HIV-1 RNA from as little as a 2.2 x 10(-4) TCID50 unit equivalent of culture supernatant of HIV-1-infected cells and a single molecule of HIV-1 gag complementary RNA synthesized by in vitro transcription. By use of this most sensitive assay, we successfully detected HIV-1 RNA in serum or plasma from all 22 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) and 13 out of 14 untreated asymptomatic carriers. Of 43 asymptomatic carriers under the treatment with interferon-alpha or azidothymidine, 17 cases showed negative results, indicating that the virus activity was suppressed by the therapeutics. We also noted the inhibitory effect of heparin on RT-PCR."

In addition, VL rebounds could increase HIV-specific immune responses. Twenty-six successfully treated HIV-infected adults were randomized to receive a vaccination schedule or placebo during 12 months. Afterward, HAART was discontinued. Influences of vaccination over VL, genotypic mutations, different T cell subsets, and HIV-1-specific immune responses were evaluated. Patients did not present any secondary effect. No differences in incidence of detectable VL determinations were detected between groups [relative risk 0.54 (95% CI 0.23-1.26)]. No relevant resistance mutations were detected. The vaccinated group showed a significant drop in CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.046) associated with increases in activated T cells. HIV-1-specific lymphoproliferative responses increased more in the vaccinated group during the vaccination period. Viral rebound dynamics after interrupting HAART were similar in both groups. A vaccination schedule in successfully treated HIV patients was safe, was not associated with an increase in detectable VL, and did not increase the risk of developing resistance mutations. However, it induced an increase in T cell activation and a drop in CD4(+) T cells, although these changes did not influence the VL rebound dynamics after HAART interruption."
2301,0.005,1.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."

Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (Peg-IFN-alpha-2a) has been successfully used for treating HEV infection in liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis. A kidney transplant patient with chronic HEV infection evolved to end-stage kidney disease and started haemodialysis. Three months after immunosuppressive therapy was stopped, HEV RNA was still detected both in serum and in stools. Before considering a retransplantation, we decided to initiate Peg-IFN-alpha-2a therapy to eradicate the virus. A 3-month course of Peg-IFN-alpha-2a was scheduled, and the latter was started at the weekly dose of 135 microg. Serum HEV RNA became negative by Week 3 of Peg-IFN-alpha-2a therapy, and remained negative until the last follow-up, i.e. 6 months after anti-viral therapy was stopped. Hence, we report the first known case of a 3-month course of Peg-IFN-alpha-2a inducing a sustained virological response in this HEV-positive and RNA-positive haemodialysis patient who had failed to be cleared of the virus after immunosuppressant withdrawal."

A similar strategy has never been employed in HIV/AIDS patients who also have high risk of developing EBV-associated lymphoma. A total of 5 HIV-infected patients were enrolled to evaluate their EBV-specific T cell responses by Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) ELISpot assays. Most patients had detectable T cell responses, mainly directed at Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA-3). The authors wanted to see whether it was possible to augment magnitude and spectrum of the EBV responses by stimulating patient PBMC with cells presenting autologous EBV antigens. The authors successfully established spontaneously EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBVh-BCL) and used them for generation of EBV-specific CTL (EBV-CTL). The EBVh-CTL lines established in the present study were not only highly cytotoxic against the autologous virus but also able to secrete IFNgamma detected by ELISpot. The authors are now in the process of generating these lines in a large number and in a clinical grade for adoptive immunotherapy."
4703,0.005,1.0000,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."
969,0.005,1.0000,"To reduce unnecessary exposure to treatment, physicians must decide at an early stage whether continuation of treatment has a reasonable chance of success for the individual patient. The objectives of our study were to evaluate the previously described quantitative hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) measurements vs quantitative hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA measurements for prediction of nonresponse and response in interferon (IFN)-alpha treated HBeAg positive chronic HBV patients. Serum HBV DNA and HBeAg levels were assessed at baseline and weeks 8 and 12. For each test (HBV DNA level at baseline, HBV DNA decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, or the combination of these two, as well as HBeAg level at baseline, HBeAg decrease between baseline and weeks 8 and 12, and the combination of these two), we calculated the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity. Monitoring with quantitative HBV DNA levels (area under ROC 0.87) was superior to monitoring with quantitative HBeAg levels (0.76, P < 0.05). Step-wise logistic regression identified HBV DNA at baseline and decrease in HBV DNA from baseline to week 12, as independent predictors of response. The overall test performance of predicting nonresponse (predictive value 100%) was best for log HBV DNA testing at week 12 compared with testing at week 8 due to a better prediction of sustained response (46%vs 38%) and lower misidentification of nonresponse (39%vs 54%). This study showed that quantitative HBV DNA testing at baseline in combination with a decrease between baseline and week 12 has a high predictive value for identifying patients who have virtually no chance of reaching a sustained response with IFN therapy."

Recently, it has been suggested that HBV is associated with other human cancers. However, the association between HBV and the risk of onset of hematological malignancies remains controversial. The aim of this large-scale retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between HBV infection and hematological malignancies. A retrospective analysis of 86,115 newly admitted patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital was performed. A cohort of patients previously exposed to HBV (n = 1,874) and a cohort of individuals without a positive test for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc; n = 45,118) were compared to assess the risk of hematological malignancies. Anti-HBc was positive in 61.2% cases and 54.3% controls (p = 0.0001). The risk of B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma was higher in the HBV-infected cohort than in the non-HBV-infected cohort.

We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."

The most common indications for liver biopsy were liver test abnormalities (89.5%), fever for 2 weeks (71.9%), and hepatomegaly (52.0%). The most common biopsy-derived diagnosis was Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), seen in 87 (17.4%) biopsies. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 13 biopsies (2.6%). In 28 biopsies (5.6%) mycobacteria was seen, but speciation of the organism was not possible. Chronic active viral hepatitis was seen in 60 biopsies (12.0%). Opportunistic hepatic infection from other organisms was found in 14 biopsies (2.8%). The most common neoplasm was lymphoma, which was seen in 12 biopsies (2.4%). MAC infection of the liver was associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01). Among patients with fever for 2 weeks after an extensive negative workup including bone marrow biopsy, 58.2% had a diagnosis by liver biopsy. Overall, 64.3% of liver biopsies yielded a histopathological diagnosis, 45.7% of which were potentially treatable. We could not evaluate whether liver biopsy had a positive effect on patient outcome and survival, nor did we attempt to prove that liver biopsy resulted in a change in treatment or a change in preprocedure clinical diagnosis. Thus, questions about the efficacy of liver biopsy cannot be answered. Liver biopsy may be a helpful diagnostic tool in HIV-positive patients with fever, liver test abnormalities or hepatomegaly."

However, there have been very few studies addressing this issue in Cameroon. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in HIV/AIDS patients in Dschang -Cameroon. Stool and blood specimens from HIV/AIDS patients and control group were screened respectively for intestinal parasites and for HIV antibodies. Intestinal parasites were identified using direct microscopy, formalin-ether concentration and Ziehl Neelsen methods. Out of 396 participants recruited among patients consulting at hospital, 42 (10.6%) were HIV positive, thirty of them treatment naïve. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 14.64%. Out of 42 HIV/AIDS patients, 59.5% (25/42) were infected with intestinal parasites, while only 9.32% (33/354) of the HIV negative patients were infected with intestinal parasites. The parasites detected in our study population included Crystosporidium parvum (2.53%), Entamoeba histolytica (7.52%), Entamoeba coli (4.04%), Giardia lamblia (0.25%), Trichuris trichura (0.25%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%). In the HIV infected group, Crystosporidium parvum (19.04%), Entamoeba histolytica (19.04%), Entamoeba coli (21.42%), Giardia lamblia (2.38%), Strongyloides stercoralis (0.25%) and Taenia spp. (0.25%) were found. Crystosporidium parvum was found to be significantly higher in HIV/AIDS patients than in controls (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the HIV status and the quality of water were the major risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. Routine examinations of stool samples for parasites would significantly benefit the HIV patients by contributing in reducing morbidity and improving the efficiency of antiretroviral treatment. Even after the introduction of free anti-retroviral drugs, opportunistic intestinal infections are still a threat. HIV patients should be screened routinely for intestinal parasites and treated for their overall well being."

Through the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgG and IgM anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were found in 92 patients of which 46 (50.0%) were IgG seropositive, and only one case (1.0%) had IgM antibodies. Of the 92 patients: 53 were HIV seropositives and 39 had AIDS.

All the children have elevated total serum IgE levels (210-2475 IU/ml) and make anti-HIV-1 IgE or IgE directed against non-HIV-1 specificities (radioimmunoassay, Western blot assay); they have no detectable antigenemia. We have now studied the ability of anti-HIV-1 IgE in serum obtained from these children to regulate (1) production of HIV-1 by interleukin 2/phytohemagglutinin (IL-2/PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from HIV-1-seronegative donors and infected with a T cell-tropic clone of HIV-1, and (2) transmission of a primary HIV-1 strain from adult AIDS patients to uninfected IL-2/PHA-stimulated PBMCs (p24 core antigen production). High levels of HIV-1 production were observed when PBMCs were cultured for 5 days in the presence of HIV-1-seronegative donor serum that was either IgE positive or IgE negative (IgE, >100 or <100 IU/ml, respectively). HIV-1 production also was observed when PBMCs were cultured with HIV-1-infected donor serum that either contained IgE directed against non-HIV-1 specificities or was IgE negative; these levels were 40% less than those seen with sera from the HIV-1-seronegative donors. Far greater inhibition of virus production was observed if the serum in culture contained anti-HIV-1 IgE (>95%). Virus neutralization did not appear to account for the inhibition obtained with anti-HIV-1 IgE-containing serum because virus production was not suppressed in cultures to which serum was added immediately preinfection (<10%), but was strongly suppressed when serum was added 1.5 hr postinfection (>95%). The inhibition of virus production obtained with serum containing anti-HIV-1 IgE was reversed when (1) serum was depleted of IgE (immunoaffinity), but not when it was depleted of IgG (protein G-Sepharose) before inclusion in culture postinfection, (2) anti-IgE, but not anti-IgG, was included in culture, or (3) serum was heat treated before culture. The results indicate that serum from certain HIV-1-infected pediatric long-term survivors contains agents that inhibit HIV-1 production in vitro, and that these agents include anti-HIV-1 IgE. They suggest that a cytotoxic event, rather than virus neutralization, plays an important role in anti-HIV-1 IgE-mediated inhibition of virus production."
8963,0.005,1.0000,"Human CD4 (HuCD4) is the principal receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human cell infection. Susceptibility of rabbit cell lines to infection with HIV-1 raised questions concerning whether a CD4 homolog serves as HIV-1 receptor on rabbit cells. Sequence comparisons of rabbit CD4 (RbCD4) cloned from a rabbit thymus cDNA library showed that 6 of the 18 residues implicated in HIV-1 binding by CD4 differ between the human and rabbit proteins. No correlation between RbCD4 expression by rabbit cell lines and their ability to support HIV-1 infection was seen. Transfection of RbCD4-negative, HTLV-I-transformed cell lines with HuCD4 significantly enhanced HIV-1 infectivity, suggesting that these lines lack a receptor present on other RbCD4-negative lines that produce high levels of p24 in their native state. Inhibition of HIV-1 infection with soluble HuCD4 was demonstrated for all rabbit lines tested, but complete inhibition was obtained only with a rabbit T-cell line expressing RbCD4 and with HuCD4 transfectants. The results suggest that HIV-1 infection of the RbCD4-positive line proceeds through a receptor similar to HuCD4 but that an additional receptor or receptors may serve this purpose in RbCD4-negative lines."

In this report, we describe modifications of these assays for use with small volumes of saliva (50 to 100 microl). For healthy subjects, there is strong inhibition of blastoconidial viability in stimulated parotid (75%), submandibular-sublingual (74%), and whole (97%) saliva, as well as strong inhibition of germ tube formation (>80%) for all three saliva types. The susceptibility of several Candida isolates to inhibition of viability by saliva collected from healthy subjects is independent of body source of Candida isolation (blood, oral cavity, or vagina) or the susceptibility of the isolate to the antifungal drug fluconazole. Salivary anticandidal activities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were significantly lower than those in healthy controls for inhibition of blastoconidial viability (P < 0.05) and germ tube formation (P < 0. 001). Stimulated whole-saliva flow rates were also significantly lower (P < 0.05) for HIV-infected patients. These results show that saliva of healthy individuals has anticandidal activity and that this activity is reduced in the saliva of HIV-infected patients. These findings may help explain the greater incidence of oral candidal infections for individuals with AIDS."

However, the role these important cell populations play in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis or adult T cell leukemia remains unresolved. To better understand how HTLV-1 infection of these important cell populations may potentially impact disease progression, the regulation of HTLV-1 viral gene expression in established monocytic cell lines was examined. U-937 promonocytic cells transiently transfected with a HTLV-1 long-terminal repeat (LTR) luciferase construct were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to induce cellular differentiation. PMA-induced cellular differentiation resulted in activation of basal and Tax-mediated transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses demonstrated that PMA-induced cellular differentiation induced DNA-binding activity of cellular transcription factors to Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1) repeat II. Supershift analyses revealed that factors belonging to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of basic region/leucine zipper proteins (Fra-1, Fra-2, JunB, and JunD) were induced to bind to TRE-1 repeat II during cellular differentiation. Inhibition of AP-1 DNA-binding activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative c-Fos mutant (A-Fos) in transient expression analyses resulted in severely decreased levels of HTLV-1 LTR activation in PMA-induced U-937 cells. These results have suggested that following infection of peripheral blood monocytes, HTLV-1 viral gene expression may become up-regulated by AP-1 during differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells."

Here we investigated the possibility that Bacitracin and or DTNB might have other antiviral activities besides FI. By means of residual activity assays, we found that both compounds showed antiviral activity only to viruses T-tropic HIV-1 strain. Cell-based fusion assays showed inhibition on HeLa-CD4-LTR-β-gal (CD4) and HL2/3 cells treated with Bacitracin, and DTNB with the latest compound we observed fusion inhibition on both cells but strikingly in HL2/3 cells (expressing Env) indicating a possible activity on both, the cell membrane and the viral envelope. A time-of-addition experiment showed that both compounds act on HIV entry inhibition but DTNB also acts at late stages of the viral cycle. Lastly, we also found evidence of long-lasting host cell protection in vitro by DTNB, an important pharmacodynamic parameter for a topical microbicide against virus infection, hours after the extracellular drug was removed; this protection was not rendered by Bacitracin. These drugs proved to be leading compounds for further studies against HIV showing antiviral characteristics of interest."

Assessments of attitudes and knowledge were conducted one week prior to the intervention (pretest), and one (posttest 1) and 47 weeks (posttest 2) afterwards. Females had more positive attitudes about AIDS on pretest and posttest 1. Attitude scores improved significantly from pretest to posttest 1 but returned close to baseline by posttest 2. Knowledge scores were high on pretest and did not change significantly. Attitude scores were significantly correlated with knowledge, and with students' opinions regarding obligation to care for AIDS patients. Acquaintance with a homosexual was highly correlated with both scores. This intervention may serve as a model in improving students' attitudes about AIDS."

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the level of KAP of medicine and health Sciences students in Northwest Ethiopia towards occupational risk of HBV infection."
5981,0.005,1.0000,"Healthcare workers are at risk of occupationally-acquired viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is parenterally transmitted and has been found in every part of the world. This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject. Practical recommendations would help to reduce stigmatising behaviour still further."
8189,0.005,1.0000,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
3260,0.005,1.0000,"Health professionals caring for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) show poor or negative attitudes because of fear of contagion. Therefore, it is important to know the attitudes of midwives' and nurses' towards people living with HIV/AIDS. The aim of this descriptive and cross-sectional study is to assess the attitudes of Turkish midwives and nurses working at hospitals to people living with HIV/AIDS and to identify factors that affect these attitudes. A group of 46 midwives and 192 nurses working in hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected through AIDS Attitude Scale. Age, professional experience, number of children and marital status influenced the attitudes of the participants towards people living with HIV/AIDS. We concluded that higher level of education appear to positively influence the attitudes of the participants. Education programmes including evidence-based nursing implications might be planned to improve positive attitudes and to prevent stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS."
9242,0.005,1.0000,"Antiretroviral medications are effective at improving the health and increasing the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, studies have shown that a substantial number of HIV-infected people do not receive antiretroviral treatments. The current study examined the physical and mental health, substance use, and perceptions of medical care of 163 men and 78 women living with HIV/AIDS. Results of a confidential survey showed that 79 (33%) were not currently treated for HIV. These persons did not differ from those who were treated in chart-abstracted CD4 cell counts, years living with HIV infection, HIV-related symptoms, and HIV-related hospitalizations. Unlike past studies, gender was not found to be a factor in treatment status. However, untreated persons had higher chart-abstracted viral loads and were more likely to be ethnic minorities, have a lower level of education, greater level of depression, and greater pessimistic attitude. They were significantly more likely to have used alcohol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine in the previous 3 months, were likely to know their own viral load and CD4 count, and held significantly more negative views of their health care and their health care providers. There were no differences between untreated and treated persons in their meeting the year 1999 antiretroviral treatment guidelines that were in effect at the time of data collection. These results suggest that persons who are not receiving antiretroviral medications may be in need of mental health and substance use interventions and may benefit from interventions designed to engage and retain them in medical treatment."
191,0.005,1.0000,"Membranous nephropathy (MN) is caused by subepithelial deposition of immune complexes in the glomerular basement membrane, with secondary MN arising in association with infection. In secondary MN caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), seroconversion has been known to occur after the onset of MN, particularly in children. In patients with high serum concentrations of HBV DNA, treatment with interferon-α2b or a nucleoside analog has been reported to induce seroconversion and suppress HBV-DNA levels. We treated a 7-year-old boy who presented with proteinuria and liver dysfunction. He had a history of HBV infection since shortly after birth, as his mother was HBV-positive, and he was neither vaccinated nor treated with immunoglobulin at birth. Chronic hepatitis related to HBV was diagnosed following percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed HBV-related glomerulonephritis with diffuse global subepithelial and focal segmental mesangial and subendothelial deposits. Therefore, HBV-associated MN was diagnosed. Treatment with the nucleoside analog lamivudine was started to reduce serum HBV-DNA levels, but lamivudine was discontinued and treatment with entecavir was started at a dosage of 0.5 mg/day after 6 weeks because of possible adverse effects. Tests for HB envelope antibody were positive in week 16 of treatment, and proteinuria had resolved by week 22. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were seen with both treatments but were probably attributable to the developing immune response to HBV. In the present case, HBV levels needed to be reduced to: 1) lower elevated serum HBV-DNA titers, which put the patient at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma; and 2) remove the immune complexes causing MN. Use of nucleoside analogs to suppress the HBV load may facilitate early remission of MN, and entecavir therapy did not cause any serious adverse reactions in this case. Given the advent of lamivudine-resistant HBV, entecavir appears promising for patients with elevated serum levels of HBV DNA. "
9398,0.005,1.0000,"The prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence is essential after liver transplantation in patients infected with HBV. We evaluated the efficacy of primary high-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy in 639 HBV-infected adult patients who underwent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between February 1997 and December 2004. The overall 5-year survival rate was 80.7%, and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma was the most common cause of late mortality. Pretransplant HBV replication was observed in 392 (61.3%) patients. The interval of 10,000-IU HBIG administration to maintain antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen > 500 IU/L was 30 days in 11.4% patients, 40 to 50 days in 72.1%, and 60 days in 16.5%. At the last follow-up, 3.9% of the patients without HBV recurrence were receiving combination therapy. Overall 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year HBV recurrence rates were 1.4%, 5.5%, 7.3%, and 8.5%, respectively. HBV recurrence occurred after a mean of 25.7 +/- 16.4 months after LDLT. After HBV recurrence, 5 of 9 patients died from rapidly progressive liver failure before treatment with adefovir, and only 1 of 29 patients died after treatment with adefovir. Need for frequent HBIG infusions (< or =30 days), active pretransplant HBV replication, and hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence were significant risk factors for HBV recurrence and indications for combination therapy. Our posttransplant HBV prophylaxis regimen resulted in a 5-year HBV recurrence rate of 7.3% and a mortality rate of 13.2% after HBV recurrence, showing the effectiveness of high-dose HBIG monotherapy and rescue antiviral therapy."

5703,0.005,1.0000,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
4890,0.005,1.0000,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
5628,0.005,1.0000,"Plasma viral load (pVL) is a key indicator of therapeutic response in HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but is often unavailable in routine clinical care in resource-limited settings.

1938,0.005,1.0000,"We examined the ability of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) to infect in vitro, primary brain-derived human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) that constitute the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Immunofluorescence (IFA) and antigen capture assays failed to demonstrate p24 antigen from HIV inoculated endothelial cells and supernatants did not contain detectable levels of reverse transcriptase (RT). HIV could be rescued by cocultivation of infected HMEC with a susceptible T-lymphocyte line (CEM-SS), which were then shown to form syncytia and produce RT activity and p24 Ag (IFA, antigen captive assay). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successfully used to amplify HIV-specific gag and env gene sequences from HMEC. CD4 expression was not identified on these cells by IFA. These results suggest that HIV infection of BBB endothelium occurs, but that viral replication is minimal. Infection of the BBB by HIV may give the virus a foothold in the CNS and suggests that the brain might be infected directly and may not be limited to just the passage of infected mononuclear cells."

HIVDR at initiation of ART (P <.05) and 12-month CD4 cell counts <200 cells/μL (P <.05) were associated with HIVDR at 12 months. HIVDR prevention exceeded WHO guidelines (≥ 70%) at the Chennai clinic but was below the target in Mumbai due to high rates of loss to follow-up. Findings highlight the need for defaulter tracing and scale-up of routine viral load testing to identify patients failing first-line ART."

In Korea, zidovudine has been widely administered, without charge, through the National AIDS program since the early 1990s; with other potent antiretroviral agents also being introduced in the late 1990s. An analysis of the drug susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs was performed by genotyping of the drug-resistant mutations in HIV on plasma samples from 50 HIV-infected patients who had received no treatment, between February 1998 and November 2002, which was interpreted according to the consensus guidelines of the International AIDS Society-USA panel. The median CD4 cell count was 100 cells/mm3; the mean plasma RNA level was (5.19 +/- 0.56) log copies per milliliter. Of the 50 subjects tested 4 (8.0%) had one or more major drug-resistance mutation. The prevalence of resistance to multiple classes of drugs was 2.0%. No mutations, associated with resistance to non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, were identified. Resistant mutations of the reverse-transcriptase gene were found at codons 67, 70, 118, 215, and 219, and a resistant mutation of the protease gene was found only at codon 46 (2.6%, 1 of 39). There was an 8.0% prevalence of primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Korean patients infected with HIV-1."
6557,0.005,1.0000,"Resistance to antiretroviral drugs is believed to be an important cause of treatment failure in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, however, the role of susceptibility assays in the management of these individuals needs to be defined. SMART (study on mutations and antiretroviral therapy) is an ongoing study on mutations and antiretroviral therapy focused particularly on HIV-infected patients treated with two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Plasma HIV-1 RNA was assessed by NASBA (nucleic acid sequence-based amplifications) (Organon Teknika, Boxtel, The Netherlands) with a detection limit of 80 copies/ml, whereas resistance was assessed by direct sequencing of the RT pol gene in patients with detectable viraemia, and by Antivirogram (Virco) in non-responder patients. The preliminary results of this study show that both genotypic and phenotypic assays identify mutated viral strains in the majority of patients failing a dual regimen. Furthermore, the data indicate a high rate of genotypic resistance to lamivudine in both responders and non-responders, a high rate of phenotypic resistance to lamivudine in non-responders, no genotypic resistance to didanosine and stavudine in responders, and a very low rate of both genotypic and phenotypic resistance to didanosine and stavudine in non-responders."
376,0.005,1.0000,"The transmission of antiretroviral-resistant HIV-1 strains is associated with suboptimal virological responses to initial antiretroviral therapy. However, certain types of resistance mutations are known to be associated with decreased viral fitness, which confers a lower replication capacity than that of the wild-type virus in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between antiretroviral resistance mutations and viral replication in the primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) period. From January 2002 to March 2005, 52 PHI patients were identified in the Republic of Korea. HIV-1 RNA genotyping was performed, and the resistance mutation score was obtained from the HIV Drug Resistance Database of Stanford University. We defined the sum of the average resistance mutation scores (SARMS) for each antiretroviral drug class as a measure of the degree of resistance of any specific strain. The overall mean SARMS was 2.00 +/- 2.74, and the annual mean did not change significantly during the study period. No critical resistance mutation gene was identified in the study group. The SARMS showed a weak negative correlation with the viral load log10 during PHI, but without statistical significance (r = -0.274, p = 0.051). But the mean SARMS of patients with a viral load exceeding 100,000 copies/ml was significantly lower than that of patients with a viral load of less than 100,000 copies/ml (p = 0.03). Evaluation of the potency of antiretroviral resistance revealed a weak negative correlation with viral replication in the PHI period. This could be one reason why the transmission of resistant strains in PHI patients is not increasing significantly despite the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."

Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."

The sequences were inspected for resistance-associated mutations against PR and RT inhibitors. A total of 140 pol sequences were analyzed, of which 133 (95%) belong to HIV-1 subtype C, five (3.6%) were subtype B, and one each was subtype G and CRF02_AG. Five sequences (3.6%) had resistance-associated mutations. These include three (2.1%) NNRTI mutations.

We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided."
2477,0.005,1.0000,"Potent antiretroviral therapy can reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in plasma to levels below the limit of detection for up to 2 years, but the extent to which viral replication is suppressed is unknown. To search for ongoing viral replication in 10 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy for up to 1 year, the emergence of genotypic drug resistance across different compartments was studied and correlated with plasma viral RNA levels. In addition, lymph node (LN) mononuclear cells were assayed for the presence of multiply spliced RNA. Population sequencing of HIV-1 pol was done on plasma RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA, PBMC DNA, LN RNA, LN DNA, and RNA from virus isolated from PBMCs or LNs. A special effort was made to obtain sequences from patients with undetectable plasma RNA, emphasizing the rapidly emerging lamivudine-associated M184V mutation. Furthermore, concordance of drug resistance mutations across compartments was investigated. No evidence for viral replication was found in patients with plasma HIV RNA levels of <20 copies/ml. In contrast, evolving genotypic drug resistance or the presence of multiply spliced RNA provided evidence for low-level replication in subjects with plasma HIV RNA levels between 20 and 400 copies/ml. All patients failing therapy showed multiple drug resistance mutations in different compartments, and multiply spliced RNA was present upon examination. Concordance of nucleotide sequences from different tissue compartments obtained concurrently from individual patients was high: 98% in the protease and 94% in the reverse transcriptase regions. These findings argue that HIV replication differs significantly between patients on potent antiretroviral therapy with low but detectable viral loads and those with undetectable viral loads."

HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
7423,0.005,1.0000,"The primary goal when devising strategies to define the start of therapy in HIV infected individuals is to avoid HIV disease progression and toxicity from antiretroviral therapy (ART). Intermediate goals includes, avoiding resistance by suppressing HIV replication, reducing transmission, limiting spread and diversity of HIV within the body and protecting the immune system from harm. The question of how early or late to start ART and achieve both primary and intermediate goals has dominated HIV research. The distinction between early and late treatment of HIV infection is currently a matter of CD4+ T cells count, a marker of immune status, rather than on viral load, a marker of virus replication. Discussions about respective benefits of early or delayed therapy, as well as the best CD4+ T cell threshold during the course of HIV infection at which ART is initiated remains inconclusive. Guidelines issued by various agencies, provide different initiation recommendations. This can be confusing for clinicians and policy-makers when determining the best time to initiate therapy. Optimizing ART initiation strategies are clearly complex and must be balanced between individual and broader public health needs. This review assesses available data that contributes to the debate on optimal time to initiate therapy in HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals. We also review reports on CD4+ T cell threshold to guide initiation of ART and finally discuss arguments for and against early or late initiation of ART. "

This policy provides selective antenatal screening for hepatitis B in women and an inoculation program for hepatitis B vaccination for fourth-grade pupils. There has been increasing concern for this policy with regard to its influence on secular trends of acute hepatitis B incidence in Manitoba. This created a need to summarise the epidemiological characteristics of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Manitoba and to allocate finances and human resources for future prevention programs. The Cadham Provincial Laboratory in Winnipeg, a Canadian Public Health Laboratory, is responsible for testing all specimens for diagnosis of various common infectious diseases in Manitoba. During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission.

We compared SIVsab-induced changes of markers related to ADO production (CD39 and CD73) and breakdown (CD26 and adenosine deaminase) on T cells from blood, lymph nodes, and intestine collected from pigtailed macaques (PTMs) and African green monkeys (AGMs) that experience different SIVsab infection outcomes. We also measured ADO and inosine (INO) levels in tissues by mass spectrometry. Finally, we assessed the suppressive effect of ADO on proinflammatory cytokine production after T cell receptor stimulation. The baseline level of both CD39 and CD73 coexpression on regulatory T cells and ADO levels were higher in AGMs than in PTMs. Conversely, high INO levels associated with dramatic increases in CD26 expression and adenosine deaminase activity were observed in PTMs during chronic SIV infection. Immune activation and inflammation markers in the gut and periphery inversely correlated with ADO and directly correlated with INO. Ex vivo administration of ADO significantly suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by T cells in both species. In conclusion, the opposite dynamics of ADO pathway-related markers and contrasting ADO/INO levels in species with divergent proinflammatory responses to SIV infection support a key role of ADO in controlling immune activation/inflammation in nonprogressive SIV infections. Changes in ADO levels predominately occurred in the gut, suggesting that the ADO pathway may be involved in sparing natural hosts of SIVs from developing SIV-related gut dysfunction. Focusing studies of the ADO pathway on mucosal sites of viral replication is warranted."
6843,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic immune activation persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV+ individuals and underpins an increased risk of age-related co-morbidities. We assessed the Frailty Index in older HIV+ Australian men on ART. Immunometabolic markers on monocytes and T cells were analyzed using flow cytometry, plasma innate immune activation markers by ELISA, and lipidomic profiling by mass spectrometry. The study population consisted of 80 HIV+ men with a median age of 59 (IQR, 56-65), and most had an undetectable viral load (92%). 24% were frail, and 76% were non-frail. Frailty was associated with elevated Glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) expression on the total monocytes (p=0.04), increased plasma levels of innate immune activation marker sCD163 (OR, 4.8; CI 1.4-15.9, p=0.01), phosphatidylethanolamine PE(36:3) (OR, 5.1; CI 1.7-15.5, p=0.004) and triacylglycerol TG(16:1_18:1_18:1) (OR, 3.4; CI 1.3-9.2, p=0.02), but decreased expression of GM3 ganglioside, GM3(d18:1/18:0) (OR, 0.1; CI 0.0-0.6, p=0.01) and monohexosylceramide HexCerd(d18:1/22:0) (OR, 0.1; CI 0.0-0.5, p=0.004). There is a strong inverse correlation between quality of life and the concentration of PE(36:3) (ρ=-0.33, p=0.004) and PE(36:4) (ρ=-0.37, p=0.001). These data suggest that frailty is associated with increased innate immune activation and abnormal lipidomic profile. These markers should be investigated in larger, longitudinal studies to determine their potential as biomarkers for frailty."

A cross-sectional study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels was conducted among HIV-1-infected Thai patients to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vitamin D levels (25[OH]D <30 ng/mL) in tropical setting. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Of 178 patients, 58% received antiretroviral therapy at median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 7.4 (5.9-8.5) years. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-29.9 ng/mL) was 26.8% and 44.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving efavirenz (EFV) was significantly associated with low vitamin D status (odds ratio = 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-12.15, P <.05). The mean (±standard deviation) level of 25(OH)D in patients receiving and not receiving EFV was 22.9 (6.6) and 28.6 (10.7) ng/mL, respectively, (P <.05).

However, the anti-viral potential of metabolites produced by S. carteri has not been extensively explored. In this study, an S. carteri extract was HPLC fractionated and a cell based assay was used to evaluate the effects of HPLC fractions on parameters of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) infection and cell viability. Candidate HIV-1 inhibitory fractions were then analyzed for the presence of potential HIV-1 inhibitory compounds by mass spectrometry, leading to the identification of three previously characterized compounds, i.e., debromohymenialdisine (DBH), hymenialdisine (HD), and oroidin. Commercially available purified versions of these molecules were re-tested to assess their antiviral potential in greater detail. Specifically, DBH and HD exhibit a 30%-40% inhibition of HIV-1 at 3.1 μM and 13 μM, respectively; however, both exhibited cytotoxicity. Conversely, oroidin displayed a 50% inhibition of viral replication at 50 μM with no associated toxicity. Additional experimentation using a biochemical assay revealed that oroidin inhibited the activity of the HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase up to 90% at 25 μM. Taken together, the chemical search space was narrowed and previously isolated compounds with an unexplored anti-viral potential were found.

5453,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."

From February 1, 2000 to April 30, 2001, specimens from 6,805,010 units of serologically negative donation were screened in minipools of 50 samples within 24 hr after blood donation by NAT using multiplex HBV/HCV/HIV-1 reagent for blood transfusion including short shelf-life platelets. Among them, 112 HBV DNA-positives, 25 HCV RNA positives and 4 HIV-1 RNA positives were screened out and we could prevent transfusion of these NAT positive units. Subtypes/genotypes of HBV DNA, adr/C, adw/A, adw/B, adw/C, ayr/C and ayw/D were found and adr/C was predominant. A total of 61.6 % of them (69/112) were negative by overnight EIA. Sixth three of HBV NAT-positive samples carried virus loads less than 10(4) copies/mL and 92.1 % of them (58/63) were negative by overnight EIA. The virus growth curves of HBV in 6 cases obtained by retrospective and prospective follow-up study showed exponential straight lines in the early stage of serological window periods and the log times of HBV growth (10 fold increase) in serological window period were between 4.6 and 7.6 days. NAT screening with highly sensitive reagents in pool of specimens is useful to exclude blood units with low level of HBV and HBV mutants from blood transfusion."

The V3 loops of 7 Indian isolates contained the apical tetra peptide GPGQ, while the V3 loop of one Indian isolate carried the apical tetra peptide GPGK. The amino acid sequences of the seven Indian isolates were closely related to each other, with an average of the nucleotide sequence homology of 96.0% (94.6 to 97.6%). The marked relatedness of the amino acid sequences among the seven Indian HIV-1 isolates indicated a recent and very rapid spread of this HIV-1 variant in Bombay. The amino acid sequence of the C2/V3 region of env gene of the 7 Indian isolates were homologous to the C subtype reported by Meyers et al.

At baseline, HIV prevalence was 25.3%, and HCV prevalence was 54.5%. Seropositive persons with prevalent HIV infection were used to estimate baseline HIV incidence by means of the Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Portland, Oregon). Longitudinal HIV and HCV incidence were measured among 865 HIV-negative IDUs and 519 HCV antibody-negative IDUs followed semiannually for 2 years. Participants received pre- and posttest risk reduction counseling at each visit. Estimated HIV incidence at baseline was 2.95 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21, 4.69) by BED assay; observed HIV incidence over 1,262 person-years was 0.48 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.17, 1.03). HCV incidence over 645 person-years was 1.71 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.85, 3.03). Self-reported risk behaviors declined significantly over time, from 100% of participants reporting drug injection at baseline to 11% at 24 months. In this cohort with high HIV and HCV prevalence at enrollment, the authors observed low incidence and declining self-reported risk behavior over time. While no formal intervention was administered, these findings highlight the potential impact of voluntary counseling and testing in a high-risk cohort."

Generated envelope protein (Env)-recombinant virus was examined for its infectivity, and then 35 infectious CRF01_AE Env-recombinant viruses were selected. Sequencing analysis revealed that the interclone variation of the deduced amino acid sequences was higher in CRF01_AE env genes isolated in 2006 than in those isolated in the early 1990s, suggesting that env gene variation has been increasing gradually among CRF01_AE viruses prevalent in Thailand. We also examined the characteristics of the deduced amino acid sequences of 35 CRF01_AE env genes.

Hu et al., J Virol 70: 7,462-7,470 (1996)]. The present study was designed to determine whether neuraminidase (NA) is useful for isolation of HIV-1 from patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or CD4+ cells isolated from the PBMC of infected individuals were cocultured with PBMC or CD4+ cells from uninfected healthy donors, and the efficiency and frequency of virus isolation in the presence of NA were compared with those by a routine conventional procedure. In a total of 41 isolation trials from 28 individuals, the presence of NA markedly increased the frequency of isolation. Furthermore, both the day when virus was first detected and the day when the virus titer was the highest in the cultures were significantly earlier in the presence of NA than in the absence of NA. The deduced amino acid sequences of the V2 and V3 regions of gp120 were identical or very similar between the isolates obtained in the presence or absence of NA, suggesting that both isolation procedures selected a similar population. NA was thus found to facilitate HIV-1 isolation and its use is recommended particularly when isolation is negative by the conventional procedures."
6893,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."

7965,0.005,1.0000,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are virulent intracellular pathogens that invade and multiply within macrophages. The effect of M. tuberculosis on HIV-1 infection and replication was analyzed in vitro using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. Preinfection of MDM with M. tuberculosis followed by HIV-1 infection resulted in an increase in p24 release, reverse transcriptase activity, and infective virus production. In contrast, no increase in HIV-1 production was observed when MDM were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex or heat-killed M. tuberculosis. Coinfected MDM were potent stimulators of T cell proliferation, while HIV-1-infected MDM failed to present exogenous tuberculin to T cells. Furthermore, coinfected MDM showed an increased capacity to transmit HIV-1 to activated T cells. These results suggest that M. tuberculosis infection can both up-regulate HIV-1 infection and replication within MDM and increase the efficiency of virus transmission from infected MDM to T cells."
2578,0.005,1.0000,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

HIV-1 testing was positive and lymphocyte subset profile showed CD(4) count of 9/mm(3). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, significant portal and retroperitoneal cystic adenopathy, and multiple cystic lesions in the spleen and liver. CT guided cyst aspiration and node biopsy detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded well on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy. Tuberculosis rarely involves the pancreas, probably due to the presence of pancreatic enzymes which interfere with the seeding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is considered to be the result of dissemination of the infection from nearby lymphatic nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound or CT guided fine needle aspiration for cytology is the recommended diagnostic technique. Although the prognosis is good with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it could be fatal without correct diagnosis and treatment.

There was no evidence of bias in the patient report of date of diagnosis of HIV infection or date or result of most recent CD4 count, although there was considerable imprecision. Past and current prescription of AZT were recalled accurately by patients compared with medical records (kappa = 0.89 and 0.86, respectively), but previous HIV-related illnesses and enrollment in clinical studies or trials were generally recalled poorly (kappa < 0.4 in some cases).

In addition, most such studies have taken place in the developed West. We investigated the association between alcohol use and immune reconstitution through CD4 count response among HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at an urban sub-Saharan African clinic. This was a retrospective cohort study of treatment-naïve HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Nairobi, Kenya and followed for 12 months between January 2009 and December 2012. At enrollment, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic variables and alcohol consumption. CD4 count was measured every six months. Linear regression models assessed the association between CD4 count and alcohol consumption, categorized as abstinent, moderate, or hazardous. Overall, 854 participants were included, 522 of which were women, with 85 (25.6%) men and 50 (9.6%) women reporting any alcohol use, and 8 (2.4%) men and 7 (1.3%) women reporting hazardous drinking. At baseline, alcohol use was associated with higher education and socioeconomic status. Median CD4 count was higher among alcohol users compared to those who abstained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-ART initiation, although this was only significant at 6 months. There were no differences in adherence between abstainers and drinkers. While overall alcohol use was significantly associated with higher CD4 counts, moderate and hazardous use treated separately were not. We conclude that, while alcohol use was associated with higher CD4 counts at 12 months post-ART, the mechanism for this association is unclear but may reflect unmeasured socioeconomic or nutritional differences. Additional research is required on the specific drinking patterns of this population and the types of alcoholic beverages consumed to clarify this relationship."
4844,0.005,1.0000,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "

Pharmacists can protect themselves against HIV infection by following established infection control procedures; at the same time, they must exercise responsibility for the safety of their associates, of pharmacy technicians, students, and residents, and of other health-care workers. In many institutions this responsibility is shared with nurses. As educators, pharmacists must play a leading role in the dissemination of correct, up-to-date information about HIV infection, body substances precautions, and new product use and availability in both the hospital and the community.

9306,0.005,1.0000,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."
5929,0.005,1.0000,"The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS of nursing students in Turkey. HIV/AIDS has become one of the most serious health problems in the world. It is important to understand nursing students' knowledge and attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLHIV) because the educational preparation of nurses has been known to affect the attitudes of the nurse and the effectiveness of the care provided to PLHIV. The study was conducted with 227 nursing students from the School of Health in Antalya, Turkey during the calendar year 2005/2006. Qualitative and quantitative methods were both used to collect data for the study. Analysis of variance, t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Kruskal-Wallis and inductive methods were used in data analysis. The majority of nursing students in this study had a moderate level of HIV/AIDS knowledge. Students correctly answered 64.4% of HIV/AIDS-related questions in the questionnaire (Mean 28.99; SD 7.03 out of 45 points). Scores increased parallel with student grade (F=26.925; p=0.000) and age (chi2 (K-W)=35.117; p=0.000). Fear of being infected and feelings of pity and empathy were the feelings most commonly indicated by the students. Students who had previous experience in caring for an AIDS patient and had known someone with HIV/AIDS were willing to care for PLHIV. Results underline the need to strengthen education on all aspects of HIV/AIDS. To improve nursing students willingness to care for PLHIV, particular emphasis should be placed on the training of nursing students as skilled nursing staff with humane attitudes towards PLHIV."

After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors.

This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."

Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction, especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family, are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD).

We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."

The results show that, despite the progress attained in the management of HIV infection since the introduction of HAART, clinicians facing newly diagnosed cases of AIDS will likely encounter a spectrum of opportunistic diseases and a level of underlying immunodeficiency similar to those observed during the decade preceding the introduction of HAART. Even in recent years, the large majority of patients newly diagnosed with AIDS have not been able to take advantage of HAART prior to diagnosis of their disease."

Interestingly, patient characteristics did not differ significantly in the pre- and post-HAART groups. Sixty-eight percent of patients had CD4-cell counts of <50/μl. Outcome after treatment with pyrimethamin plus sulfonamides or clindamycin (47% each) did not differ; adverse reactions were more frequent in patients receiving sulfonamides than in those receiving clindamycin (25% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.02). Interestingly, patients in the post HAART group had not received (82.9%) or had not taken HAART adequately (17.1%). Concurrent diagnosis of TE and HIV was significantly more often in the post- compared to the pre-HAART group (49 vs. 26%, respectively; p > 0.001).

6861,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a major cause of cancer-related death in Southeast Asia, is frequently associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV X protein (HBx), encoded by a viral non-structural gene, is a multifunctional regulator in HBV-associated tumor development. We investigated novel signaling pathways underlying HBx-induced liver tumorigenesis and found that the signaling pathway involving IκB kinase β (IKKβ), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream effector S6 kinase (S6K1), was upregulated when HBx was overexpressed in hepatoma cells. HBx-induced S6K1 activation was reversed by IKKβ inhibitor Bay 11-7082 or silencing IKKβ expression using siRNA. HBx upregulated cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, and these HBx-upregulated phenotypes were abolished by treatment with IKKβ inhibitor Bay 11-7082 or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. The association of HBx-modulated IKKβ/mTOR/S6K1 signaling with liver tumorigenesis was verified in a HBx transgenic mouse model in which pIKKβ, pS6K1, and VEGF expression was found to be higher in cancerous than non-cancerous liver tissues. Furthermore, we also found that pIKKβ levels were strongly correlated with pTSC1 and pS6K1 levels in HBV-associated hepatoma tissue specimens taken from 95 patients, and that higher pIKKβ, pTSC1, and pS6K1 levels were correlated with a poor prognosis in these patients. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that HBx deregulates TSC1/mTOR signaling through IKKβ, which is crucially linked to HBV-associated HCC development."

In patients with chronic hepatitis and high levels of viral replication, inhibitors of the virus polymerase can reduce serum titre and favourably affect the inflammatory process in the liver.

Treatment effects a rapid and profound decrease of serum virus titre, with attendant clinical benefit. Unfortunately drug-resistant species may emerge after 6 months of suppressive therapy. Lamivudine-resistant species have specific amino acid substitutions in the HBV-encoded polymerase. Emergence of these species is frequently associated with loss of clinical benefit. Published data suggest that lamivudine-resistant species exhibit cross-resistance to famciclovir, thereby limiting the potential use of famciclovir with lamivudine as combination therapy. Adefovir is under clinical evaluation for treatment of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. Preliminary data suggest that adefovir achieves potent inhibition of both species.

Four patterns of condom use and associated levels of risks and beliefs were identified. These patterns suggest value in targeting intervention strategies to individuals at different levels of risk. The findings also imply that the monogamous population may be at higher risk for infection than they realize. Primary-care physicians are the first line of contact for many individuals in the health care system and may be in the best position to screen for at-risk individuals.

It blocks HBV replication in liver cells and is available as a once-daily oral formulation. The efficacy of tenofovir for the treatment of chronic HBV has been demonstrated to be superior to adefovir in randomized controlled trials, which led to its FDA approval for use in chronic HBV. Because of its potent antiviral activity, favorable safety profile, and higher barrier to the development of resistance, tenofovir should replace adefovir as a first-line monotherapy option in the treatment of HBV in monoinfected patients. In the HIV-HBV-coinfected population, tenofovir is already a preferred agent in combination with other anti-HBV agents (lamivudine or emtricitabine), which are cotreatments for HIV as well.

Envelope (env) gene expression was dependent upon the viral regulatory protein Tat. Induction of the mutant env resulted in resistance to cytopathic effects mediated by wild-type envelope and decreased infectious vector virus production. When cells containing the mutant env gene were infected with wild-type virus, viral spread was inhibited. The fact that maintenance of the env gene was stable over time suggests that inducible gene therapy using the dominantly interfering env mutant may be a feasible approach to slowing the progression of HIV-1 disease."
4594,0.005,1.0000,"In order to study the stoichiometry of monoclonal antibody (MAb) neutralization of T-cell line-adapted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in antibody excess and under equilibrium conditions, we exploited the ability of HIV-1 to generate mixed oligomers when different env genes are coexpressed. By the coexpression of Env glycoproteins that either can or cannot bind a neutralizing MAb in an env transcomplementation assay, virions were generated in which the proportion of MAb binding sites could be regulated. As the proportion of MAb binding sites in Env chimeric virus increased, MAb neutralization gradually increased. Virus neutralization by virion aggregation was minimal, as MAb binding to HIV-1 Env did not interfere with an AMLV Env-mediated infection by HIV-1(AMLV/HIV-1) pseudotypes of CD4(-) HEK293 cells. MAb neutralization of chimeric virions could be described as a third-order function of the proportion of Env antigen refractory to MAb binding. This scenario is consistent with the Env oligomer constituting the minimal functional unit and neutralization occurring incrementally as each Env oligomer binds MAb. Alternatively, the data could be fit to a sigmoid function. Thus, these data could not exclude the existence of a threshold for neutralization. However, results from MAb neutralization of chimeric virus containing wild-type Env and Env defective in CD4 binding was readily explained by a model of incremental MAb neutralization. In summary, the data indicate that MAb neutralization of T-cell line-adapted HIV-1 is incremental rather than all or none and that each MAb binding an Env oligomer reduces the likelihood of infection."

We describe virological characterization of a clade B RT Env SHIV following infection of macaques via multiple routes. In vivo passage of the RT Env SHIV through Indian rhesus macaque enhanced infectivity. Expanded virus had minimal envelope heterogeneity and was inhibited by NNRTIs and CCR5 antagonists. Infection of macaques with RT Env SHIV via mucosal or intravenous routes resulted in stable infection accompanied by peak plasma viremia of approximately 5×10(6) copies/ml that was controlled beyond set point. Molecular homogeneity of the virus was maintained following in vivo passage. Inhibition of RT Env SHIV by RT and entry inhibitors and ease of in vivo transmission make it a useful model for testing the efficacy of combinations of entry and RT inhibitors in nonhuman primates.
7684,0.005,1.0000,"The initial phases of acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection may be critical for development of effective envelope (Env)-specific antibodies capable of impeding the establishment of the latent pool of HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T cells, preventing virus-induced immune hyperactivation to limit disease progression and blocking vertical virus transmission. However, the initial systemic HIV-1 Env-specific antibody response targets gp41 epitopes and fails to control acute-phase viremia. African-origin, natural simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) hosts do not typically progress to AIDS and rarely postnatally transmit virus to their infants, despite high milk viral loads. Conversely, SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), Asian-origin nonnatural SIV hosts, sustain pathogenic SIV infections and exhibit higher rates of postnatal virus transmission. In this study, of acute SIV infection, we compared the initial systemic Env-specific B cell responses of AGMs and RMs in order to probe potential factors influencing the lack of disease progression observed in AGMs. AGMs developed higher-magnitude plasma gp120-specific IgA and IgG responses than RMs, whereas RMs developed more robust gp140-directed IgG responses. These gp120-focused antibody responses were accompanied by rapid autologous neutralizing responses during acute SIV infection in AGMs compared to RMs. Moreover, acute SIV infection elicited a higher number of circulating Env-specific memory B cells in peripheral blood of AGMs than in the blood of RMs. These findings indicate that AGMs have initial systemic Env-specific B cell responses to SIV infection distinct from those of a nonnatural SIV host, resulting in more functional SIV-specific humoral responses, which may be involved in impairing pathogenic disease progression and minimizing postnatal transmission."

The delayed growth of nef mutant virus was observed at the initial stage of replication in all cell lines examined. This phenomenon was greatly amplified in the absence of vpu gene. In order to determine the infection stage in viral replication cycle which is specifically affected on virus replication rate in the presence of the Nef protein, we first examined the difference between wt and nef mutant viruses in the virus production rate from transfected cells, and found that the both viruses were produced with equal efficiency. This result showed that Nef protein could be dispensable for virion production. Therefore, early infection stages were focused by single-round infection assay, and the nef mutant virus was found to be much less infectious than wt virus. This indicated that the effect of Nef protein was exhibited in the early phase of a virus replication cycle, during viral adsorption to integration. By entry assay using wt and nef mutant virions, it was revealed that the Nef protein was required for efficient viral entry. These data suggest that the Nef protein might play a role in efficient incorporation of the Env protein into the virions, leading to enhanced viral infectivity."

Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."
9565,0.005,1.0000,"Neonatal rhesus macaque 95-3 was inoculated with nonpassaged simian-human immunodeficiency virus strain SHIV-vpu(+), which encodes env of the laboratory-adapted human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strain IIIB and is considered nonpathogenic. CD4(+) T-cell counts dropped to <200 cells/microl within 4.6 years, and monkey 95-3 died with opportunistic infections 5.9 years postinoculation. Transfer of blood from 95-3 to two naive adult macaques resulted in high peak viral loads and rapid, persistent T-cell depletion. Progeny virus evolved in 95-3 despite high SHIV-vpu(+) neutralizing antibody titers and still used CXCR4 but, in contrast to parental SHIV-vpu(+), productively infected macrophages and resisted neutralization. Sequence analysis revealed three new potential glycosylation sites in gp120; another two were lost. Strikingly similar mutations were detected in a laboratory worker who progressed to AIDS after accidental HIV-IIIB infection (T. Beaumont et al., J. Virol. 75:2246-2252, 2001), thus supporting the SHIV-vpu(+)/rhesus macaque system as a relevant model. Similar mutations were also described after rapid passage of chimeric viruses encoding IIIB env in rhesus and pig-tailed macaques (M. Cayabyab et al., J. Virol. 73:976-984, 1999; Z. Q. Liu et al., Virology 260:295-307, 1999; S. V. Narayan et al., Virology 256:54-63, 1999; R. Raghavan et al., Brain Pathol. 7:851-861, 1997; E. B. Stephens et al., Virology 231:313-321, 1997). Thus, HIV-IIIB env evolved similarly in three different species; this selection occurred in chronically infected individuals during disease progression as well as after rapid virus passage. We postulate that evolutionary pressure led to the outgrowth of more aggressive viral variants in all three species."
301,0.005,1.0000,"Recent studies have found geographic variations in immune and viral human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes associated with census measures of neighborhood poverty and segregation. Although readily available, such aggregate census measures are not based on health behavior models and provide limited information regarding neighborhood effect pathways. In contrast, survey-based measures can capture specific aspects of neighborhood disadvantage that may better inform community-based interventions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the measurement validity of multi-dimensional survey measures of neighborhood disorder compared with census measures as predictors of HIV outcomes in a cohort of 197 low-income women in a major metropolitan area. The multi-dimensional survey measures were related to each other and to census measures of concentrated poverty and racial segregation, but not so highly correlated as to be uniform. We found notable variation between community areas in women's CD4 levels but there was no corresponding geographic variance in viral load, and relationships between community area measures and viral load disappeared after adjustment for individual characteristics, including HIV treatment adherence. In multilevel models adjusting for individual characteristics including substance use, depression, and HIV treatment adherence, one survey measure of neighborhood disadvantage (poor-quality built environment) and one census measure (racial segregation) were significantly associated with greater likelihood of CD4 < 500 (p < .05)."
5894,0.005,1.0000,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."

A whole-blood infection model that employs a luminescent readout was used to analyze the role of T cells in control of mycobacterial infection. Control of mycobacterial growth in blood from healthy tuberculin-positive individuals was shown to be mediated predominantly by CD4(+) T cells. Comparison of age-matched cohorts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and -uninfected children from South Africa demonstrated an association between low CD4 cell counts, low interferon (IFN)-gamma production, and impaired ability to regulate growth of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin in blood from HIV-infected children. Impaired control of infection was not reconstituted by the addition of exogenous IFN-gamma. The whole-blood assay provides an important tool for monitoring and dissecting of human immune responses to mycobacterial infection."
7230,0.005,1.0000,"Like tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social inequalities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the care of patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings."

We thus questioned which factors influenced the occurrence of fibrosis in a cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients. HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients naive of anti-HCV therapy for whom a liver biopsy was performed between 1996 and 2003 were retrospectively studied in three University hospitals in Paris and the Parisian region. One hundred and fifty two patients (131 men and 21 women; mean age 39.3+/-4.9 years) were studied. Most of them (62%) were treated with HAART. HCV genotypes included type 1 (N=78), type 2 (N=1), type 3 (N=38) and type 4 (N=35). Mean duration of HCV infection was 19.0+/-5.2 years. Sixty-six percent had minimal to moderate fibrosis (F0/F1/F2) and 34% severe fibrosis (F3/F4). Multivariate analysis retained METAVIR activity score (OR=2.60, 95%CI [1.46-4.64]; P=0.001), mixed pattern of steatosis (OR=3.29, 95%CI [1.24-8.71]; P=0.017) and a CD4 cell count<200/mm3 (OR=4.04, 9%CI [1.47-11.12]; P=0.007) as independent factors associated with severe fibrosis. HAART did not influence the occurrence of liver fibrosis.

5644,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C viral (HCV) kinetics after initiation of interferon-based therapy provide valuable insights for understanding virus pathogenesis, evaluating treatment antiviral effectiveness and predicting treatment outcome. Adverse effects of liver fibrosis and steatosis on sustained virological response have been frequently reported, yet their impacts on the early viral kinetics remain unclear. In this study, associations between histology status and early viral kinetics were assessed in 149 HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (DITTO trial). In multivariate analyses adjusted for critical factors such as IL28B genotype and baseline viral load, presence of significant fibrosis (Ishak stage > 2) was found to independently reduce the odds of achieving an initial reduction (calculated from day 0 to day 4) in HCV RNA of ≥2 logIU/mL (adjusted OR 0.03, P = 0.004) but was not associated with the second-phase slope of viral decline (calculated from day 8 to day 29). On the contrary, presence of liver steatosis was an independent risk factor for not having a rapid second-phase slope, that is, ≥0.3 logIU/mL/week (adjusted OR 0.22, P = 0.012) but was not associated with the first-phase decline. Viral kinetic modelling theory suggests that significant fibrosis primarily impairs the treatment antiviral effectiveness in blocking viral production by infected cells, whereas the presence of steatosis is associated with a lower net loss of infected cells. Further studies will be necessary to identify the biological mechanisms underlain by these findings."

Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
5844,0.005,1.0000,"The pathogenesis of cellular immune deficiency following human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection could result from quantitative and/or qualitative dysfunction of the CD4+ lymphocyte population. To better characterize the T-cell response to soluble antigen with HIV infection, we have isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and purified populations of CD4+ lymphocytes from healthy HIV antibody-positive subjects, patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex (ARC), and healthy HIV antibody-negative controls. T-lymphocyte function was determined by proliferative response to lectin (phytohemagglutinin), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore, purified recombinant HIV envelope gp120, tetanus toxoid antigen, and tetanus toxoid antigen in the presence of recombinant gp120 or purified recombinant soluble CD4. PBLs and CD4+ lymphocytes from asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects responded equally well to lectin, PMA, and/or calcium ionophore and to tetanus toxoid as cells from uninfected control subjects. The cells that proliferated in response to a soluble antigenic stimulus did not respond to gp120. Cells from subjects with ARC had a selective antigen recognition defect independent of the number of CD4+ lymphocytes. Recombinant gp120 inhibited CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation to antigenic stimulus by 30-40%. Recombinant soluble CD4, a proposed therapeutic for HIV, had no effect on T-cell response to antigen. A selective antigen recognition response was not compromised early in HIV infection but was compromised in subjects with ARC. Inhibition of proliferation to tetanus toxoid by gp120 suggests that HIV may affect major histocompatibility complex II restricted antigen recognition independent of CD4+ cell loss."

9071,0.005,1.0000,"CD4+ T cells of patients with AIDS exhibit a qualitative defect in their ability to respond to soluble antigen while their responses to mitogens remain normal. CD4+ T cells can be broadly divided phenotypically into ""naive"" [CD45RA+ (2H4+)] and ""memory"" [CD29+ (4B4+) or CD45RO+ (UCHL1+)] cell subpopulations, which represent distinct maturation stages. To determine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectability of memory and naive CD4+ T-cell subsets in vitro and to determine the in vivo preference of HIV-1 in these subpopulations, we obtained highly purified CD4+ T-cell subsets from normal and HIV-1-infected individuals and studied them by viral cultivation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays. Polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that the memory cell subset of CD4+ T cells is preferentially infected (4- to 10-fold more than naive T cells) by HIV-1 in vitro, and these memory cells are the principal reservoir for HIV-1 within CD4+ T cells obtained from infected individuals. Functional abnormalities attributable to CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals (failure to respond in vitro to soluble antigen or to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies) were shown to reside primarily within these memory cells. Thus, the present study suggests that the selective functional defects present in the memory CD4+ T-cell subset of HIV-infected individuals may be a direct result of the preferential infection and consequently greater viral burden within these cells."

However, patients with extensive fibrosis or cirrhosis were under-represented in all the registration Phase III trials performed so far. To assess the influence of liver fibrosis on the outcome of anti-HCV therapy, all patients with genotype 3a hepatitis C who were naive to IFN-based therapies, and received RBV combined with standard IFN or pegylated IFN-(alpha2b (peg-IFN-alpha2b) as standard of care for their disease, were investigated at our centre. A sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 68 of 91 patients (75%) independent of IFN type, pretreatment viraemia, clearance of HCV RNA at week 4 and relevant co-morbidities. A SVR was less common in cirrhotics (6 of 17) than in non-cirrhotics (62 of 74; 35% vs 84%; P<0.0005). Compared to non-cirrhotics, the age and sex adjusted odds ratio (OR) of treatment failure for cirrhotics was 10.1 (95% confidence interval: 2.4-41.7). By multivariate analysis, cirrhosis was the only predictor of non-SVR. In conclusion, cirrhosis is an independent predictor of IFN/RBV treatment failure in patients chronically infected with HCV 3a and is associated with an increased risk of post-treatment hepatitis relapse. Evaluation of liver fibrosis is important in the management of patients with genotype 3a hepatitis C, since it helps to predict response to IFN/RBV therapy."

There were 84 patients with a mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 42.2 (10.2) years and 77% were males. Median (range) duration of ART and lamivudine use was 46 (3-177) and 40 (3-140) months, respectively. Median (range) CD4 cell count was 352 (49-790) cells/mm(3). Of all, 19 (23%) had HBV-DR with a median (range) HBV DNA of 2.56 x 10(7) (2.54 x 10(3)-11 x 10(7)) IU/mL.

The spectrum of bacterial pathogens is limited and somewhat different from that in other risk groups. The localization is exclusively to joints affected by haemophilic arthropathy. The laboratory picture is characterized by the absence of peripheral leucocytosis, varying CD4-helper cell counts, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and fever. The clinical picture mimics that of haemarthrosis, often causing a delay in diagnosis. Treatment with systemic antibiotics is often sufficient, obviating the need for arthrotomy and open drainage.

HDV released into the media was assayed for HDV RNA and HBV envelope proteins and characterized by rate-zonal sedimentation, immunoaffinity purification, electron microscopy, and the ability to infect primary human hepatocytes. Among the novel findings were that (i) immunostaining for delta antigen 6 days after infection with 300 genome equivalents (GE) per cell showed only 1% of cells as infected, but this was increased to 16% when 5% polyethylene glycol was present during infection; (ii) uninfected cells did not differ from infected cells in terms of albumin accumulation or the presence of E-cadherin at cell junctions; and (iii) sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assays detected HDV replication even when the multiplicity of infection was 0.2 GE/cell. In the future, this HDV assembly and infection system can be further developed to better understand the mechanisms shared by HBV and HDV for attachment and entry into host cells."

Nevertheless, infection caused by other human retroviruses like HIV-2, HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 is gaining importance. Initially confined to specific geographical areas, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are becoming a major concern in non-endemic countries due to international migration flows. Clinical manifestations of retroviruses range from asymptomatic carriers to life-threatening conditions, such as AIDS in HIV-2 infection or adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia or tropical spastic paraparesis in HTLV-1 infection. HIV-2 is naturally resistant to some antiretrovirals frequently used to treat HIV-1 infection, but it does have effective antiretroviral therapy options. Unfortunately, HTLV still has limited therapeutic options. In this article, we will review the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic, pathogenic and therapeutic aspects of infections caused by these human retroviruses. "

In the present study, the diagnostic value of a newly developed immune-complex dissociated nonstructural-1 (NS-1) antigen dot blot immunoassay (DBI) was compared to a commercially available DEN antigen detection kit (denKEY Blue kit; Globio Co., Beverly, Mass.) and a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit. Serial serum or plasma samples (n = 181) obtained from 55 acute DEN-infected patients were used. In samples obtained from 32 of these 55 DEN-infected patients, viral RNA could be detected by RT-PCR. DEN antigen was detected in only 10 of these 55 patient samples by using the denKEY kit. When these samples were treated with acid to release the immune-complex-associated NS-1 antigen for detection by DBI, 43 of these 55 patients were found to be positive for DEN NS-1 antigen. In nondissociated samples, 22 of these patients were found to be positive by the DBI. In the presence of DEN-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, both viral RNA and DEN (NS-1) antigen could be detected. The number of positive samples identified by RT-PCR and DBI from these patients with primary DEN infections varied between 28 and 78%. In secondary DEN infections, the number of samples that tested positive by the DBI after immune-complex dissociation (DIS-DBI) was 25% higher than the number of samples that tested positive by RT-PCR and was 35% higher than that determined by nondissociated antigen (NDIS-DBI) detection. We conclude that the denKEY kit has limited diagnostic value for acute DEN infections compared to the RT-PCR and the NDIS-DBI and DIS-DBI methods. We clearly demonstrate that in secondary DEN infections the dissociation of NS-1 immune complexes is essential for early diagnosis of DEN infections."

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of polymorphisms CCR5-Δ32, CCR2-64I, CCR5-59029A and SDF1-3'A and their role in the course of HIV infection in a Southern Brazilian population. Clinical data were obtained from 249 patients for an average period of 6.4 years and genotypes were determined by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Survival analyses were conducted for three outcomes: CD4+ T-cell counts below 200 cells/µL, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death. The frequency of the polymorphisms CCR5-Δ32, CCR2-64I, CCR5-59029A and SDF1-3'A were 0.024, 0.113, 0.487 and 0.207, respectively. CCR5-Δ32 was associated with a reduction in the risk for CD4+ T-cell depletion and with an increased risk for death after AIDS diagnosis. CCR2-64I was associated with a reduction in the risk for developing AIDS. SDF1-3'A was also associated with decreased risk for AIDS, but its effect was only evident when CCR2-64I was present as well. These results highlight the possibility of using these markers as indicators for the prognosis of disease progression and provide evidence for the importance of analysing the effects of gene polymorphisms in a combined fashion."

3124,0.005,1.0000,"The Hepatitis C virus has emerged over the last two decades as the cause of the second greatest viral infection epidemic after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A significant characteristic of the infection with the Hepatitis C virus is the variable course of its natural history. About 80% of the people who acquire this agent develop a chronic infection, with varying degree of liver damage, including cirrhosis and even hepatocelular carcinoma. However, only a minority progresses towards more severe forms. Several factors associated with the host seem to influence the progression of Hepatitis C into cirrhosis. The most important are alcohol abuse, the age in which the infection is acquired, duration of the infection, overweight, male sex and coinfection with Hepatitis A or B or HIV. Evidence of the role of iron levels in the liver, tobacco or the source of infection are less clear. The factors associated with the agent do not seem to play any role in the progression of the disease. Additional studies with adequate control groups are required to confirm the participation of the above mentioned host factors and to identify others which could influence the natural history of the Hepatitis C infection. A reduction in the ingestion of alcohol, overweight and tobacco consumption could contribute to the treatment of HVC chronic infection, as well as vaccination against Hepatitis A and B."
3776,0.005,1.0000,"Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) are the main genes that control cell death in the immune system. Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."
446,0.005,1.0000,"The paper describes some preliminary attempts to formulate simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of HIV infection in homosexual communities. In conjunction with a survey of the available epidemiological data on HIV infection and the incidence of AIDS, the models are used to assess how various processes influence the course of the initial epidemic following the introduction of the virus. Models of the early stages of viral spread provide crude methods for estimating the basic reproductive rate of the virus, given a knowledge of the incubation period of the disease (AIDS) and the initial doubling time of the epidemic. More complex models are formulated to assess the influence of variation in the incubation period and heterogeneity in sexual activity. The latter factor is shown to have a major effect on the predicted pattern of the epidemic; high levels of heterogeneity decrease its magnitude. Areas of biological uncertainty, future research needs, and public health implications are discussed."

996,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B continues to be a global problem, with an estimated 240 million cases according to the World Health Organization. Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

3367,0.005,1.0000,"This study aimed to describe the adherence of persons living with HIV/AIDS to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to investigate adherence predictors among the following: level of schooling, presence of side effects, current or previous interruption of ART by the persons themselves, self-esteem, self-efficacy expectation, coping strategies, social support, and satisfaction with the health professional-patient relationship. Adherence was measured by self-reported number of ART pills/capsules missed during the previous week and previous month, evaluated as satisfactory when less than 5%. 101 HIV+ adults took part in this study, 60.4% males, ranging from 20 to 71 years of age (mean = 37.9 years), and 73.3% symptomatic. Data procedures included interviews and the use of validated instruments. The majority of participants (n = 73; 72.3%) reported adherence of > 95%. Logistic regression showed that a history of self-reported ART interruption and self-efficacy expectations were significant adherence predictors. Upgrading of care with interdisciplinary teams is needed to develop an appropriate approach to the medical and psychosocial difficulties of ART adherence by persons with HIV/AIDS."
2320,0.005,1.0000,"Psychological distress is common among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, and has been associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), leading to poor virologic suppression, drug resistance, and increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR) = 1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (OR = 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV."
1145,0.005,1.0000,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
9176,0.005,1.0000,"The authors aimed to describe cell phone and Internet use and assess the correlation of Internet use for health care engagement purposes and HIV clinical outcomes among HIV-positive individuals. The authors conducted a national survey using online social media to examine cell phone and Internet use, self-reported HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), and antiretroviral adherence rating (excellent vs. less than excellent). Participants (N = 1,494) were asked about their Internet use for health care engagement purposes (including e-mailing health care providers, refilling medications online, and making medical appointments online). Approximately 95% of participants accessed the Internet nearly daily or daily in the past month (mean hours on Internet use per day = 5.2) and 55.5% used the Internet for health care engagement purposes. Those who used the Internet for any health care engagement purposes had a 1.52-fold odds of reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .009) and a 1.49-fold odds of reporting excellent adherence (p = .001). Although Internet access and use were similar across racial/ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups, disparities existed with the use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low to moderate financial stability, lower education, and history of incarceration. The authors' data reveal that among HIV-positive users of online social media, use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes is associated with better self-reported virologic and adherence outcomes."
961,0.005,1.0000,"T7 RNA polymerase transcripts of a putative full-length cDNA clone of hepatitis C virus type 1 (HCV-1) were used to transfect a differentiated human hepatoma cell line, Huh7. The transfected genome replicated in cells, as evidenced by the appearance of progeny HCV RNA, detection of negative-strand viral RNA, and incorporation of [3H]uridine into the viral genome. Incubation of naive Huh7 cells with conditioned medium from transfected cells resulted in a new HCV infection, suggesting the production of biologically active virus in the inoculum. Maintenance of the transfected cells under serum-free culture conditions resulted in the selection of persistently infected cells which displayed a distinctive cellular morphology. This is the first demonstration that HCV RNA produced from cloned HCV cDNA is infectious and replication competent. This approach should provide a valuable system for studying HCV replication, persistence, and pathogenicity."
6698,0.005,1.0000,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reduces the mortality of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it does not eliminate HIV reservoirs. In this study, which used a 6-thioguanine (6-TG) resistant clone (4C6) of the MT-2 cell line as a model, the combination of 6-TG with both reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitor and protease inhibitor or 6-TG with a protease inhibitor alone completely eradicated HIV-1-carrying cells from the culture and protected uninfected 4C6 cells from HIV-1 infection. The combination of 6-TG and a RT inhibitor, azidothymidine, provided partial protection. Protection was extended to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggest that adding a cytotoxic drug in combination antiviral chemotherapy may reduce the establishment of virus reservoirs and prevent virus spread. The clinical value of this and similar strategies should be further evaluated in HIV-infected patients."
6100,0.005,1.0000,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."
5034,0.005,1.0000,"The majority of HIV-1 infections worldwide occur in Africa, where subtype B viruses are rare and intersubtype recombinants are common. Pathogenesis and vaccine studies need to focus on viruses derived from African patients, and infectious HIV-1 molecular clones can be useful tools. To clone non-B subtypes and recombinant viruses from patients, we cultivated HIV-1 from the plasma of a Kenyan long-term survivor. Viral DNA was cloned into a plasmid, which was transfected into COS cells; progeny virus was propagated in PBMCs. Sequence analyses revealed that both the patient's plasma HIV-1 RNA and the cloned DNA genomes were recombinants between subtypes D and C; subtype C sequences comprised the nef and LTR regions. The cloned virus used the CCR5 coreceptor and did not form syncytia in vitro. This infectious HIV-1 subtype D/C recombinant molecular clone obtained from a Kenyan long-term survivor promises to be useful to study pathogenesis and vaccine design."

6417,0.005,1.0000,"Restoration of anti-viral immune response may be a requisite for sustained virological response to treatment in chronic hepatitis B patients. Over a 13-month period, we examined the dynamics of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific CD8+ cells in six human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2+ hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)+ 'immunotolerant' chronic hepatitis B patients treated sequentially with corticosteroid and lamivudine. Our results show that the combination treatment did not result in a sustained restoration of anti-viral specific CD8+ cells in five of the six patients studied. However, HBV-specific CD8+ cells, despite being severely compromised, were not totally deleted. Paradoxically, steroid treatment was not associated with inhibition but with a minimal increase of the HBV-specific CD8 response, and we observed that nucleocapsid-specific CD8 responses were not rescued by stable and prolonged inhibition but became detectable after rapid rebounds of HBV replication. In most patients, the transient and minimal restoration of HBV-specific immunity was not associated with clinical benefits. Our results describe a dynamic relationship between HBV-specific CD8+ cells and HBV-DNA values, that could potentially be used for a better design of HBV treatment in HBeAg+ 'immunotolerant' chronic hepatitis B patients."
7279,0.005,1.0000,"We have examined the kinetics of the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particle infectivity by protease inhibitors (PIs) in cell culture, using either transfected HeLa cells or infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as producers of infectious virions. Both the kinetics of the initiation of antiviral activity after addition of the PIs to these cultures and the kinetics of restoration of virion infectivity after removal of the PIs from the treated cultures were examined. We found that the kinetics of initiation of particle infectivity inhibition produced by a high extracellular concentration (5 microM) of the inhibitors were similar for all five inhibitors tested: loss of particle infectivity was perceptible as early as 1 h after the initiation of PI treatment and increased gradually thereafter. By contrast, the durability of this antiviral effect following removal of the drug from the culture varied dramatically according to the drug studied. In transfected HeLa cells, saquinavir and nelfinavir exerted the most prolonged inhibition, with the half-lives of their antiviral activities being greater than 24 h, while ritonavir exerted an intermediate length of inhibition (18 h) and indinavir and amprenavir exerted a reproducibly shorter length of inhibition (5 h). For all five tested PIs, these kinetics were significantly faster in PBMCs than in HeLa cells. The striking differences in antiviral kinetics observed among the different PIs appear mostly due to differences in their intracellular concentrations and/or rates of cellular clearance. Our observations, although limited to tissue culture conditions, may help delineate the cellular parameters of the antiviral activities of HIV-1 PIs and further optimize the efficiencies of these antiretrovirals in vivo."
2775,0.005,1.0000,"Acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported for the first time in Egypt in 1986. Up to March 1993, 60 cases were notified to the Ministry of Health and 359 were detected to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most cases had acquired infection abroad through blood, blood products or sexual contact. The number of cases is continuously increasing. Fear and ignorance about HIV infection causes panic among health care workers (HCWs) whenever a case is discovered and needs medical care. We assessed the knowledge and attitude of 346 HCWs towards the probability of occupational HIV infection using a self administered questionnaire. The sample included physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance workers. 72.8% of HCWs believed that they are in ""great"" danger of acquiring AIDS through occupational exposure, whereas 0.6% thought that there was no danger. 67% of HCWs had wrong ideas about transmission of HIV (toilet seats, droplet infection, touching patients). 83.5% mentioned that AIDS patients should be isolated in quarantine. The main source of information about AIDS was the television, radio and ordinary press. 44.8% got their information from textbooks or scientific literature. 95.4% felt the need for more information about infection and disease. The results show an urgent need to start a program of education of HCWs concerning the risk of occupational HIV infection and the measures of its prevention."
922,0.005,1.0000,"XM323 represents a novel class of potent inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease. In vitro studies have shown that inhibition of this enzyme translates into potent inhibition of replication of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2. The inhibition of virus replication was assessed with three assays designed to measure the production of infectious virus, viral RNA, or p24 antigen. The production of mature infectious virions was measured with a yield reduction assay. By this assay, several strains and isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2 were shown to be susceptible to XM323 in two lymphoid cell lines (MT-2 and H9) and in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a concentration required for 90% inhibition (IC90) of 0.12 +/- 0.04 microM (mean +/- standard deviation). The production of HIV-1(RF) RNA was measured with an RNA hybridization-capture assay. With this assay, XM323 was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1(RF) replication, with an IC90 of 0.063 +/- 0.032 microM. A third measure of virus replication, the production of p24 viral antigen, an essential protein component of the virion, was determined with the AIDS Clinical Trial Group-Department of Defense peripheral blood mononuclear cell consensus assay. This assay was used for expanded testing of XM323 against 28 clinical isolates and laboratory strains of HIV-1. XM323 was shown to be equally effective against zidovudine-susceptible and zidovudine-resistant isolates of HIV-1, with an overall IC90 of 0.16 +/- 0.06 microM."
8575,0.005,1.0000,"Programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitory signal pathway has been verified to be involved in the establishment of persistent viral infections. Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 engagement to reinvigorate T cell activity is supposed to be a potential therapeutic scheme. Studies have verified the participation of PD-1/PD-L1 in hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein-regulated immune response. To determine the roles of PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway in HCV F protein-induced immunoreaction in chronic HCV infection, variations in T cells were examined. The results showed that PD-1 expression on CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells was increased with HCV F stimulation in both chronic HCV patients and healthy controls, and could be reduced partly by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking. Additionally, by PD-1/PD-L1 blocking, HCV F-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation and promotion of cellular apoptosis were partly or even totally recovered. Furthermore, levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were elevated in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody. All these results indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signal pathway also participates in HCV F protein-induced immunoregulation. PD-1/PD-L1 blocking plays important roles in the restoration of effective functionality of the impaired T cells in chronic HCV patients. "
1035,0.005,1.0000,"UC781, a thiocarboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), inhibited RT DNA polymerase activity in vitro with marked potency. Significant inhibition was noted at a 1:1 molar ratio of UC871 to RT, characteristic of a tight-binding inhibitor. Infectivity of the HIV-1(IIIB) laboratory strain was eliminated in a concentration-dependent manner following short exposure of isolated virion particles to UC781. Neither nevirapine nor certain other carboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitors were effective in this manner. Endogenous reverse transcription in UC781-treated virus particles was markedly reduced. Treatment of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells with UC781 did not alter virus production, but the infectivity of the virus produced by the cells during drug exposure was markedly reduced. Moreover, the infectivity of nascent virus produced by the UC781-treated H9 cells after removal of exogenous drug was dramatically attenuated. Similarly, pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected patients abolished the infectivity of virus produced by these cells after removal of exogenous drug, as measured by coculture experiments with uninfected cord blood mononuclear cells, indicating the utility of UC781 against a variety of clinical HIV samples. Importantly, preincubation of uninfected MT2 cells with UC781 rendered these cells refractory to subsequent HIV infection in the absence of extracellular drug, an effect that persisted for several days following removal of exogenous drug. These unique properties of UC781 indicate that this nonnucleoside inhibitor may have considerable promise for use in retrovirucidal formulations to minimize the spread of HIV from infected to noninfected individuals."
6594,0.005,1.0000,"Current therapy for chronic hepatitis B is suboptimal as a result of limited durable response rates, cumulative viral resistance, and/or poor tolerability. Telbivudine has potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in the woodchuck model and has a promising preclinical safety profile. In this first clinical study of telbivudine, safety, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in 43 adults with hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B. This placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial investigated 6 telbivudine daily dosing levels (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/d); treatment was given for 4 weeks, with 12 weeks' follow-up. Serum HBV DNA levels were monitored via quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results indicate that telbivudine was well tolerated at all dosing levels, with no dose-related or treatment-related clinical or laboratory adverse events. telbivudine plasma pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional within the studied dose range. Marked dose-related antiviral activity was evident, with a maximum at telbivudine doses of 400 mg/d or more. In the 800 mg/d cohort, the mean HBV DNA reduction was 3.75 log10 copies/mL at week 4, comprising a 99.98% reduction in serum viral load. Correspondingly, posttreatment return of viral load was slowest in the high-dose groups. Viral dynamic analyses suggested a high degree of efficiency of inhibition of HBV replication by telbivudine and helped refine selection of the optimal dose. In conclusion, these results support expanded clinical studies of this new agent for the treatment of hepatitis B."
967,0.005,1.0000,"Fifty-three patients with chronic hepatitis B and active viral replication were studied for 4 weeks while on treatment and for 12 weeks after treatment with the oral nucleoside analogue lamivudine. Children aged 2 to 12 years were randomized to receive twice-daily doses of 0.35, 1.5, or 4 mg of lamivudine solution per kg of body weight or once-daily doses of 3 mg of lamivudine solution per kg. Adolescents aged 13 to 17 years received lamivudine at 100 mg (as tablets). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assay were taken on days 1 and 28. Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with the maximum concentration in serum being reached 0.5 to 1 h postdosing. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was higher in younger children and decreased with age, with CL/F values for adolescents reaching those seen for adults by the age of 12. All doses produced a dramatic fall in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, with a median reduction of >/=99.5% after 4 weeks of treatment and with the levels returning to the baseline levels posttreatment. The correlation of dose, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and changes in HBV DNA levels, as measured by the Chiron Quantiplex assay, showed maximal antiviral effects (99.9% inhibition and a reduction of the amount of HBV DNA of approximately 3 log(10)) at 3 mg/kg/day, with no discernible increase in effect seen whether the drug was given at 4 mg/kg twice daily or whether it was given once daily or twice daily. The limit of detection of the assay (2.5 pg/ml) was reached for some but not all patients across the dose ranges, with the smallest number (n = 2) of those having values negative by the Chiron Quantiplex assay being in the lowest-dose group. The 13- to 17-year-olds showed a similar overall response in terms of the HBV DNA level reduction compared to that for patients younger than age 13. Analysis of the same samples by PCR, which has a lower limit of sensitivity than the Chiron Quantiplex assay, also showed average drops in HBV DNA levels of about 3 log(10) at 4 weeks for patients for which the AUC was >/=4,000 ng. h/ml, confirming the conclusions given above. Lamivudine treatment was well tolerated at all doses, with no significant adverse events or laboratory data changes. On the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, a 3-mg/kg/day dose in children (ages 2 to 12 years) with chronic hepatitis B provides levels of exposure and trough concentrations similar to those seen in adults following the receipt of doses of 100 mg. The 100-mg dose is being evaluated in a large phase III study with HBV-infected pediatric patients."
5189,0.005,1.0000,"Despite the fact that the survival of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has improved worldwide because of the increasingly powerful and highly active antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infections (OIs) of the central nervous system (CNS) remain a serious burden. HIV-1 is capable of entering the CNS through infected peripheral monocytes, but its effect on OIs of CNS remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with CNS OIs. A total of 24 patients with CNS OIs and 16 non-CNS OIs (control) cases were selected. These AIDS patients were infected with HIV-1 by paid blood donors in China. HIV-1 loads in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were detected using RT-PCR, and the C2-V5 region of HIV-1 envelope gene was amplified from viral quasispecies isolated from CSF using nested PCR. The CSF HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was higher than that of non-CNS OIs, but plasma HIV-1 load of CNS OIs was not higher than that of non-CNS OIs. The nucleotide sequence of C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs had a high diversity, and the HIV-1 quasispecies isolated from the CSF of CNS OIs revealed R5 tropism as 11/25 charge rule. These results suggest that high levels of divergent HIV-1 quasispecies in the CNS probably contribute to opportunistic infections. "

Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9920,0.005,1.0000,"The prevalence, virological and epidemiological aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections vary among hemodialysis patients in different countries. Aiming at analyzing these aspects of HCV and HBV infections in hemodialysis patients in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, we studied three hemodialysis units including 434 patients. Serology was used to detect anti-HCV and HBsAg. Reverse trancriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) of the 5'-noncoding region was used to detect circulating HCV RNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for genotyping. Seroprevalence varied from 26.5% to 11.1% for hepatitis C and from 5.9% to 0% for hepatitis B. Risk factors observed for HBV and/or HCV infections were the number of patients per dialysis unit, duration of treatment, number of clinics attended, number of blood units transfused, and lower level scholarity. Alanine aminotransferase levels were altered with a higher frequency in HBV or HCV seropositive patients. Half of ten patients, negative for anti-HCV, had detectable viremia by RT-nested-PCR, indicating that this technique should be used to confirm infections in this group of patients. The HCV genotype 1 was the most frequently observed, followed by the genotype 2, but no correlation was detected between genotype and clinical or epidemiological data."
891,0.005,1.0000,"Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara spp. are zoonotic parasites with potentially severe long-term consequences for those infected. We estimated incidence and investigated distribution, risk factors, and costs associated with these parasites by examining hospital discharge abstracts submitted to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (2002-2011). Annual incidence of serious toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis was 0.257 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.254-0.260) and 0.010 (95% CI: 0.007-0.014) cases per 100,000 persons, respectively. Median annual health-care costs per serious case of congenital, adult-acquired, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated toxoplasmosis were $1,971, $763, and $5,744, respectively, with an overall cost of C$1,686,860 annually (2015 Canadian dollars). However, the total economic burden of toxoplasmosis is likely much higher than these direct health-care cost estimates. HIV was reported as a comorbidity in 40% of toxoplasmosis cases and accounted for over half of direct health-care costs associated with clinical toxoplasmosis. A One Health approach, integrating physician and veterinary input, is recommended for increasing public awareness and decreasing the economic burden of these preventable zoonoses."

A competitor DNA was constructed from a conserved region of the HIV-1 gag gene by deleting a sequence of 18 base pairs. We quantitated HIV-1 proviral DNA copy number in clinical samples. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 35 HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count range of 4-728 cell/mm3 were analyzed by this method. The copy numbers of HIV-1 DNA detected ranged between 518 to 67,340 copies per 10(6) CD4+ T-cells. The copy numbers correlated inversely with the CD4 counts."
3984,0.005,1.0000,Serum from patients which tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were analyzed for the presence of HCV RNA by nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and for anti-HCV antibodies by Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA II). Total RNA was extracted from whole blood by a new procedure and subjected to reverse transcription of HCV RNA employing primers to the conserved 5' non-coding region of the HCV genome. PCR performed on these samples uncovered several false positive ELISAs. Reciprocal confirmation between PCR and RIBA II results was observed. These results substantiate this variation of the HCV PCR assay as a reliable alternative for routine confirmation of HCV serological tests.
3284,0.005,1.0000,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."

Carriers of HBV have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide an estimated 350 million people are infected with HBV, and 15-40% will develop serious sequelae in their lifetime. In our study we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first exon and promoter region of the mannose-binding lectin gene 2 (MBL2) situated on chromosome 10, with susceptibility to HBV infection. One-hundred and two patients infected with HBV were included in this study, and 232 uninfected individuals were used as healthy controls. Genotyping of the first exon (alleles A/O) was performed using a melting temperature assay. Genotyping of the promoter region (-550 H/L; -221 Y/X) was performed using the Taqman PCR technique. In the HBV-infected group we found a significantly increased frequency of haplotypes associated with low serum MBL. Our findings may indicate that MBL has a protective role against HBV infection in the studied population."
2859,0.005,1.0000,"Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes."

However, many patients only present and are diagnosed with HIV infection when they already have advanced disease. The optimal treatment for patients with advanced HIV disease remains to be defined. Key management questions include whether the virological and immunological responses to ART are comparable to those seen in patients with less advanced disease; whether the efficacy of different antiretroviral (ARV) regimens differs in patients with advanced disease; and whether there is an increased risk of drug toxicity and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome."

The prognostic significance of these parameters during primary HIV-1 infection, however, remains largely unknown. In a cohort of 53 male study subjects (age, 33 +/- 7 years), who consecutively presented with primary HIV-1 infection, we analyzed the relationship between early plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, beta2-microglobulin, and p24-antigen levels determined in the first 3 months and subsequent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts 6 to 12 months after onset of primary symptoms. Peak, nadir, and median HIV-1 RNA levels in the first 30 days were already significantly associated with HIV-1 RNA levels at 6 to 12 months (p = .02, p < .0001, and p = .01, respectively). Similarly, early nadir and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in the first 30 days showed a significant relationship with CD4+ T-cell counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .009 and p = .0008, respectively). Study subjects with an early decline of CD4+ counts to <500 cells/microl had an eightfold higher risk that CD4+ counts were <500 cells/microl at 1 year. Of all evaluated virologic parameters, only nadir HIV-1 RNA at 76 days predicted CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .006). Early HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ counts are already associated with the time course of those parameters 6 to 12 months after onset of symptoms. Nadir viral load was the strongest predictor of HIV-1 RNA levels as well as of CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months. An early decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes may be a useful clinical prognostic marker for rapid disease progression."

Although to a lesser extent, C-to-T1653 and T-to-V(C/A/G)1753 were also noteworthy in our previous study. To assess the clinical significance of these mutations, we determined the nucleotide sequence of an HBV DNA fragment covering these sites in HBsAg-positive blood donors (n = 160) and patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 66), liver cirrhosis (n = 45), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 58), most of whom were infected with genotype C HBV (subtype adr). In cases where HBe antigen was positive, the frequency of T1653 and/or V1753 showed a striking increment from chronic hepatitis patients (18%) to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatoma patients (82%), whereas that of T1762/A1764 was already high in chronic hepatitis patients (76%). In HBe antigen-negative cases, by contrast, significant difference in the frequency of T1653/V1753 mutants was found between blood donors (22%) and chronic hepatitis patients (67%). Our results suggest that T1653/V(particularly C)1753 mutants are more closely associated than T1762/A1764 with the progression of liver disease from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis in HBe antigen-positive patients. A system of site-directed mutagenesis PCR RFLP was constructed to diagnose T1653 and C/A1753 more conveniently. Detecting T1653 and C/A1753 by this method would contribute to the differential diagnosis of HBV-associated liver disease."

Current antiviral therapies with nucleoside analogues can inhibit the replication of HBV, but do not disrupt the already existing HBV covalently closed circular DNA. The newly developed CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated 9) system is a powerful tool to target cellular genome DNA for gene editing. In order to investigate the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt the HBV DNA templates, we designed eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) that targeted the conserved regions of different HBV genotypes, which could significantly inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the HBV-specific gRNA/Cas9 system could inhibit the replication of HBV of different genotypes in cells, and the viral DNA was significantly reduced by a single gRNA/Cas9 system and cleared by a combination of different gRNA/Cas9 systems.

The total number of subjects was 406; 196 blood donors, 78 cases of acute hepatitis, 43 of chronic hepatitis, 58 of liver cirrhosis and 31 of hepatocellular carcinoma cases. HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc as HBV markers and anti-HCV (ELISA, Ortho) as an HCV marker were tested. Positive rates of HBsAg and anti HCV among blood donors were 7.1% and 3.1% respectively, and there was no significant difference among age groups. Donors negative for all viral markers accounted for 21.4%. Of acute hepatitis cases, 18 (23.1%) cases were hepatitis A and 8 (10.3%) cases were hepatitis B, one case of which was considered to be double infection. Acute exacerbation cases of HBV carriers were 16 (20.5%), of which 6 cases were positive for HCV antibody. Those diagnosed non-A, non-B hepatitis were 37 (47.4%), of which 3 cases where positive for HCV antibody. Blood samples from all of acute hepatitis cases were obtained within 1 week after onset of the disease, thus, it was not possible to accurately assess prevalence of hepatitis C. Positive rates on HBsAg among chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were 25.4%, 32.8% and 35.5% respectively, while those for HCV antibody were 16.3%, 43.1% and 35.5% respectively. Positive rates of HBsAg and HCV antibody for overall chronic liver diseases were 31.1% and 32.6%, and 14 (10.6%) were positive for both markers."
5867,0.005,1.0000,"Lamivudine is a safe, effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after renal transplantation. However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency."

This testis tumor incidence of 0.2% is 57 times that of the United States average of 3.5 cases per 100,000 men. Two patients were only HIV positive and 3 others already had AIDS-related complex for 2 to 15 months at the time of tumor diagnosis. Tumor histology was mixed germ cell tumor in 4 patients, pure seminoma in 1 and Burkitt's lymphoma in 1. Patients underwent routine staging evaluations. Three patients had low stage mixed germ cell tumor (clinical stage 1 or 2A) and underwent retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, which revealed pathological stage 1 or 2A disease in 1 and 2, respectively. These patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients had advanced mixed germ cell tumor (clinical stage 2C) or Burkitt's lymphoma (clinical stage 4) and received combination chemotherapy from the onset. Outcome was evaluated with regard to progression of HIV disease and tumor status. The 2 patients who were only HIV positive remained so for 9 and 48 months. The 3 patients with AIDS-related complex had progression to AIDS within 1 to 9 months and 2 of these patients died 1 1/2 and 7 months after tumor diagnosis. All 3 patients with resected low stage disease had tumor recurrence within 1 to 9 months and were begun on platinum-based combination chemotherapy. The risk of false low clinical staging and early tumor progression may be higher in HIV positive men than in other testis tumor patients. Patient ability to tolerate chemotherapy and to obtain a satisfactory tumor response appeared to be primarily related to lack of progression of HIV disease to frank AIDS."
3664,0.005,1.0000,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the core antigen (HBcAg) could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in small segment of 18 amino acids (codon 84 to 101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the 5 patients without mutation. These data suggest that this region with clustering mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of B viral liver disease, and the mutations in the region may be related to progressive liver disease."
6199,0.005,1.0000,"Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission histories are invaluable models for investigating the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of the virus and to assess the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions. Here we have characterized an HIV-1 transmission chain consisting of nine infected patients, almost all of whom were treated with antiviral drugs at later stages of infection. Partial pol and env gp41 regions of the HIV genome were directly sequenced from plasma viral RNA for at least one sample from each patient. Phylogenetic analyses in pol using likelihood methods inferred an evolutionary history not fully compatible with the known transmission history. This could be attributed to parallel evolution of drug resistance mutations resulting in the incorrect clustering of multidrug-resistant virus. On the other hand, a fully compatible phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from the env sequences. We were able to identify and quantify the molecular footprint of drug-selective pressure in pol using maximum likelihood inference under different codon substitution models. An increased fixation rate of mutations in the HIV population of the multidrug-resistant patient was demonstrated using molecular clock modeling. We show that molecular evolutionary analyses, guided by a known transmission history, can reveal the presence of confounding factors like natural selection and caution should be taken when accurate descriptions of HIV evolution are required."
2016,0.005,1.0000,"""Phylodynamic"" analysis combines various statistical procedures that can be used to correlate the epidemiological and evolutionary behavior of viral pathogens with the immune system of the host. We utilized this approach to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope DNA sequences (V1, V2, and V3) isolated from different brain compartments of a T-cell-depleted patient diagnosed with severe HIV-associated dementia at the time of death. In agreement with previous reports, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct virodemes but also revealed a significant amount of viral gene flow among different brain compartments. Local-molecular-clock analysis showed that HIV-1 meninges and temporal lobe subpopulations evolve about 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than the other viral populations in the brain. However, maximum likelihood codon-based substitution models did not detect any site under significant positive selective pressure, and the main cause of HIV-1 genetic variation appeared to be random genetic drift. Therefore, the higher evolutionary rate in the meninges and temporal lobe could be due to an enhanced infection/expansion rate of macrophages as a consequence of the immune system failure. In conclusion, in this case study, viral infection in the brain progressed with a nonspecific genetic evolution, recurrent migration events, and an expansion of macrophage-tropic sequences. The data suggest that after immune failure newly produced viral variants, which would be rapidly cleared under normal conditions, begin to productively infect macrophages in a ""self-amplifying"" cycle of infection/inflammatory response that could be at the origin of HIV-associated dementia."
2147,0.005,1.0000,"Considerable speculation and a recent publication has suggested that much of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the subset of the UK population represented by women having babies in Metropolitan London is substantially imported from Africa. Other data are supportive of this hypothesis. Ades et al. (1992) concluded that the fraction of HIV seroprevalence, identified in a large London-based study using neonatal blood from the dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, attributable to mothers born in Africa was 92.4% with 95% CI: 82-100%. This is an important observation which requires confirmation. This paper reports on an attempt to do this with closely similar methodology using the Unlinked Anonymous Survey (UAS) of HIV-1 seroprevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal centres, together with data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) on the country of origins of mothers delivering in 1991 at the 15 London centres included in the UAS. As in Ades' analysis there appeared to be a strong association between centre prevalences and the proportions of women of African origin delivering at those centres. This was consistent with a high fraction of seroprevalence attributable to such women, but it was also clear that the assumptions required for the estimation of the attributable fractions were not fully met. Analyses modified to justify the assumptions produced attributable fraction estimates ranging from 44% to 96% with lower 95% confidence limits 20% or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
163,0.005,1.0000,"The subcellular localization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral protein R (Vpr) was examined by subcellular fractionation. In HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Vpr was found in the nuclear and membrane fractions as well as the conditioned medium. Expression of Vpr without other HIV-1 proteins, in two different eukaryotic expression systems, demonstrated a predominant localization of Vpr in the nuclear matrix and chromatin extract fractions. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 19-amino-acid arginine-rich sequence impaired Vpr nuclear localization. Indirect immunofluorescence confirmed the nuclear localization of Vpr and also indicated a perinuclear location. Expression of Vpr alone did not result in export of the protein from the cell, but when coexpressed with the Gag protein, Vpr was exported and found in virus-like particles. A truncated Gag protein, missing the p6 sequence and a portion of the p9 sequence, was incapable of exporting Vpr from the cell. Regulation of Vpr localization may be important in the influence of this protein on virus replication."

Phenotypic analysis of recombinant viruses indicated that 75 amino acids from the N-terminal part of HIV-1-NDK p18gag protein together with the HIV-1-NDK envelope glycoprotein are responsible for enhanced fusogenicity of HIV-1-NDK in CD4+ lymphocytes as well as for enhanced infectivity of HIV-1-NDK in some CD4- cells lines.

5717,0.005,1.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) enhancer 1 is a transcriptional element that contributes to the liver-specific regulation of HBV gene expression. We previously identified a novel protein binding site within the enhancer that contains an 8-bp palindromic sequence motif. This motif partially overlaps the binding sites for nuclear factor 1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta (HNF3beta). Moreover, we demonstrated that this novel site is recognized by a protein or proteins, tentatively designated as palindrome-binding factor (PBF), that cooperatively interact with HNF3beta. In the present work, we have further examined the biochemical and functional attributes of PBF. Protein-DNA interaction studies indicate that three thymidine residues located at the 3'-end of the palindromic sequence motif are important for maximal PBF-binding activity. When protein-DNA complexes were photocrosslinked by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, a prominent polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa was found to associate with the PBF-binding site. Furthermore, transient transfection studies support the hypothesis that PBF contributes to enhancer 1 activity by a combinatorial mechanism that involves at least one other cis-acting sequence motif, the HNF3beta-binding site."
9966,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus splice-generated protein (HBSP), encoded by a spliced hepatitis B virus RNA, was recently identified in liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic active hepatitis B. We investigated the possible generation of immunogenic peptides by the processing of this protein in vivo. We identified a panel of potential epitopes in HBSP by using predictive computational algorithms for peptide binding to HLA molecules. We used transgenic mice devoid of murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and positive for human MHC class I molecules to characterize immune responses specific for HBSP. Two HLA-A2-restricted peptides and one immunodominant HLA-B7-restricted epitope were identified following the immunization of mice with DNA vectors encoding HBSP. Most importantly, a set of overlapping peptides covering the HBSP sequence induced significant HBSP-specific T-cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic hepatitis B. The response was multispecific, as several epitopes were recognized by CD8(+) and CD4(+) human T cells. This study provides the first evidence that this protein generated in vivo from an alternative reading frame of the hepatitis B virus genome activates T-cell responses in hepatitis B virus-infected patients. Given that hepatitis B is an immune response-mediated disease, the detection of T-cell responses directed against HBSP in patients with chronic hepatitis B suggests a potential role for this protein in liver disease progression."
7823,0.005,1.0000,"Nef, an accessory protein of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses, is a critical determinant of pathogenesis that promotes the progression from infection to AIDS. The pathogenic effects of Nef are in large part dependent on its ability to downregulate the macrophage and T-cell coreceptor, CD4. It has been proposed that Nef induces downregulation by linking the cytosolic tail of CD4 to components of the host-cell protein trafficking machinery. To identify these components, we developed a novel Nef-CD4 downregulation system in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We found that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef downregulates human CD4 in S2 cells and that this process is subject to the same sequence requirements as in human cells. An RNA interference screen targeting protein trafficking genes in S2 cells revealed a requirement for clathrin and the clathrin-associated, plasma membrane-localized AP2 complex in the downregulation of CD4. The requirement for AP2 was confirmed in the human cell line HeLa. We also used a yeast three-hybrid system and glutathione S-transferase pull-down analyses to demonstrate a robust, direct interaction between HIV-1 Nef and AP2. This interaction requires a dileucine motif in Nef that is also essential for downregulation of CD4. Together, these results support a model in which HIV-1 Nef downregulates CD4 by promoting its accelerated endocytosis by a clathrin/AP2 pathway."

2113,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."
7955,0.005,1.0000,"The outcome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is related to the set-point plasma virus load (pVL) that emerges after primary HIV-1 infection (PHI). This set-point pVL generally remains stable but eventually increases with progression to disease. However, the events leading to loss of viremic control are poorly understood. Here, we describe an individual who presented with symptomatic PHI and subsequently progressed rapidly, after an initial period of 1 year during which viral replication was well controlled. Escalation of viral replication in this atypical case was preceded by the emergence of escape variants in many epitopes targeted by dominant CD8+ T cell responses and a marked decrease in HIV-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies. There were no changes in viral tropism, replication kinetics, or neutralizing antibody titers. These findings demonstrate the temporal relationship between viral escape from CD8+ T cell activity, decrease in HIV-1-specific T cell frequencies, and loss of control of viral replication."

Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression."
8063,0.005,1.0000,"A quantitative rapid assay to detect resistant clinical human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains remains an important medical goal. A system incorporating a quantitative RNA.RNA hybridization assay that measures the amount of intracellular HIV-1-specific RNA has been employed to detect the level of inhibition by nucleoside analogues in sensitive and resistant HIV-1 strains. The RNA.RNA hybridization assay readily distinguished previously published zidovudine (ZDV; 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-resistant isolates from ZDV-sensitive isolates of HIV-1. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ZDV for HTLV-IIIB and sensitive clinical HIV-1 isolates is between 0.01 and 0.04 microM. HIV-1 strains from three patients on long-term ZDV therapy displayed a greater than 20-fold increase in the ZDV IC50 compared to sensitive strains. The drug sensitivity system was confirmed by showing that mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase gene from a ZDV-resistant isolate resulted in four amino acid changes (Leu-125----Trp, Ile-142----Val, Thr-215----Tyr, and Pro-294----Thr) including one change (Thr-215----Tyr) that has been previously reported to be associated with resistance. One clinical HIV strain with high-level ZDV resistance displayed a 5-fold increase in 2',3'-dideoxyinosine IC50 compared to that of HTLV-IIIB. A drug sensitivity assay employing RNA.RNA hybridization may be useful for extensive screening of HIV isolates from patients enrolled in clinical trials and permit the correlation of in vitro resistance with clinical outcome."
5313,0.005,1.0000,"Variation in gene sequences from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p17gag and the third hypervariable region (V3 loop) of env was examined in a cross-sectional study of single specimens from 4 HIV-1 polymerase chain reaction-positive, seronegative injection drug users. As observed in sexually transmitted disease, clones of HIV-1 genes isolated from an individual were remarkably homogeneous, with amino acid variation in the envelope region of 0.3%-0.9% and in p17gag of 0.0%-0.7%. Intersubject variation was much greater (at the amino acid level, 15% for the envelope and 4.3% for p17gag), with conservation in the envelope only of regions at the base of the V3 loop. Since at least some subjects likely acquired infection intravenously, the ability of virus to survive in seminal fluid or on mucosal surfaces cannot explain the observed homogeneity, which may depend on direct interactions between the virus and the infected cell."
3010,0.005,1.0000,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
6958,0.005,1.0000,"To explore women's experiences and beliefs concerning zidovudine (AZT) therapy during pregnancy, short-answer and open-ended questions were asked of 322 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women at increased risk for pregnancy. Specifically, we examined what women believed they had been told concerning AZT therapy during pregnancy by health care professionals and peers, experiences with taking AZT, how effective they believed AZT therapy to be, and if they would take AZT if they became pregnant. Women in the study were predominately African American (88%), single (79%), with a mean age of 32 years, and had annual incomes less than $10,000 (64%). Although 81.4% of the women had been told to take antiretrovirals, only 69.1% of the women were actually taking HIV-related medicines. Almost three-fourths of the women (70.8%) reported being told that taking AZT during pregnancy would reduce perinatal transmission. Women reported the most frequent reason for their stopping AZT was its side effects. When women who were not presently taking AZT were asked what would make them consider taking it, they most frequently said they would begin AZT if their health deteriorated or based on the advice of health care professionals. A small group of women said nothing would make them take AZT-type medications. More than one-half of the women said they felt AZT was effective in preventing perinatal HIV transmission. However, almost 20% of the women reported believing that their health care provider would not be positive about their taking AZT during pregnancy. Significant relationships were found between intent to take AZT if becoming pregnant and specific AZT-related beliefs and experiences."
2186,0.005,1.0000,"A successful pregnancy is characterised by an increase in Th2 cytokines and suppression of Th1 cytokine production. A Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD4+ cell counts and counteracts the Th1 to Th2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased risk of premature delivery reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Th1) and IL-10 (Th2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL-2-PHA, IL-2-Env, IL-10-PHA and IL-10-Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL-2 and decreased IL-10. HAART use and IL-10-Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL-2-PHA slope was associated with an 8% increased risk of premature delivery (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.0-1.17; p=0.005). HAART use in pregnancy provides significant benefits in delaying HIV disease progression and reducing the risk of mother-to-child-transmission, but may be counterproductive in terms of successful pregnancy outcome."
9339,0.005,1.0000,"Seroprevalence of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was determined among 7841 intravenous drug users (IVDUs) from drug treatment centers in Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Jersey (Asbury Park and Trenton), New York City (Brooklyn and Harlem), Philadelphia, and San Antonio, Texas; 20.9% had evidence of HTLV infection, as determined using a p21e EIA for screening and p21e blot for confirmation. With a type-specific EIA and blot used in combination, HTLV-II was identified in 97.6% of HTLV-positive IVDUs whose sera could be subtyped. HIV-1 seroprevalence was 13.2%. HTLV-II without HIV-1 was most common in Los Angeles and San Antonio. HIV-1 without HTLV-II was most common in New York, New Jersey, and Baltimore. Dual infection was most common in New York and New Jersey. Logistic regression analysis revealed that seroprevalence of HTLV-II was significantly greater with HIV-1 infection and increasing age and among women, blacks, and Mexican-Americans. In conclusion, it appears that among US IVDUs, nearly all HTLV infection is attributable to HTLV-II, and HTLV-II infection is associated with HIV-1 and sociodemographic background."

In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient.

Published data suggest that these patients are at higher risk for postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) than are uninfected patients if the site is contaminated. To determine the incidence of postoperative SSI in HIV-infected patients undergoing aseptic surgery at uncontaminated sites, we performed a prospective case series analysis. We hypothesized that the rate of postoperative SSI would be low for this aseptic procedure, irrespective of CD4(+) lymphocyte counts. Additionally, we monitored the rates of other complications, namely, hematoma, dorsal vein thrombosis, epididymitis, lymphocele, and suture extrusion."
619,0.005,1.0000,"The introduction of enfuvirtide (FUZEON) represents an important advance in the treatment of therapy-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection. However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."
8468,0.005,1.0000,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."

4173,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 group O infections remains essentially restricted to central Africa, and particularly Cameroon, although isolated cases have been reported in Western countries. Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."

Proviral DNA of X4 (LAI and NL4-3) and R5 (Ba-L) HIV-1 strains were detected in LCs integrated in the reconstituted mucosa. Infection of LCs could be specifically inhibited by the chemokines stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and -secreted), confirming the presence of functional coreceptors on LCs generated in vitro. A complete inhibition of LCs, by use of azidothymidine, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, was also observed. Moreover, HIV-1-infected LCs of the reconstructed mucosa were able to transmit R5 or X4 HIV-1 strains to activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such a model could be a useful tool to study the mechanisms involved in transmission of HIV in the female genital tract."
1965,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. The hepatitis B virus belongs to the family of hepadnaviruses that replicate their DNA genome via a reverse transcription pathway. The chronicity of infection in infected hepatocytes is maintained by the persistence of the viral covalently closed circular DNA. The main strategies to combat chronic HBV infection rely on the stimulation of the specific antiviral immune response and on the inhibition of viral replication. While the prolonged administration of reverse transcriptase inhibitors is most often associated with a control of viral replication rather than eradication, it may select for resistant mutants. The search for new viral targets is therefore mandatory to design combination strategies to prevent the emergence of resistant mutants and eventually clear viral infection."
6774,0.005,1.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is highly prevalent worldwide. In some cases, it is a consequence of infection with variant viruses mutated in the S gene and producing a surface antigen not recognized by diagnostic kits. In most cases, OBI is due to a strong inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities exerted by host defense mechanisms. OBI may reactivate in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy with the possibility of a consequent development of acute hepatitis that may lead to hepatic failure. Hematological malignancies and therapeutic schedules including rituximab are the conditions most frequently associated with OBI reactivation. However, this event may occur in a large number of additional clinical and therapeutic settings. Identification of patients prone to undergo reactivation is of great importance for promptly starting a proper antiviral therapy that may stop the HBV reactivation and prevent its clinical sequelae."
2345,0.005,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and remains a serious health problem worldwide. Covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the liver cell nucleus sustains HBV infection. Major treatments for HBV infection include the use of interferon-α and nucleotide analogs, but they cannot eradicate cccDNA. As a novel tool for genome editing, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system developed from bacteria can be used to accurately and efficiently engineer and modify genomic DNA. In this study, the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to target the HBV genome and efficiently inhibit HBV infection. We synthesized four single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the conserved regions of HBV. The expression of these sgRNAS with Cas9 reduced the viral production in Huh7 cells as well as in HBV-replication cell HepG2.2.15. We further demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9 direct cleavage and cleavage-mediated mutagenesis occurred in HBV cccDNA of transfected cells. In the new mouse model carrying HBV cccDNA, injection of sgRNA-Cas9 plasmids via rapid tail vein resulted in the low level of cccDNA and HBV protein. In conclusion, the designed CRISPR/Cas9 system can accurately and efficiently target HBV cccDNA and inhibit HBV replication. This system may be used as a novel therapeutic strategy against chronic HBV infection. "
5322,0.005,1.0000,"An estimated 3.2 million persons in the United States have chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Most new HCV transmissions occur among persons who inject drugs, often within the first few years of their injection drug use. During 2003-2012, reports of HCV infection increased from 15 to 54 cases per 100,000 among persons aged <30 years in Wisconsin, and 58% of persons in this age group with acute HCV infection reported injecting drugs (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2013). To increase detection of HCV infection, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH) piloted a program during October 2012-October 2013 that offered rapid HCV testing to clients of four agencies providing outreach testing for HCV and human immunodeficiency virus infection, syringe exchange, counseling, and other harm reduction services to persons with drug dependence. During that period, 1,255 persons were tested using a rapid HCV test, and 246 (20%) of the results were positive. Most (72%) of the infections had not been reported to WDPH. A blood specimen for further testing was collected from 192 (78%) participants with positive HCV test results; among these participants, 183 were tested for HCV RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and these results were positive for 128 (70%) participants, indicating active infection. Use of the rapid HCV test detected previously unreported HCV infections and raised awareness of HCV. Persons identified with active HCV infection should be referred to medical care and counseled on ways to prevent HCV transmission to others. "

That subpopulation was defined as consisting of all applicants tested between October 16, 1985, and June 30, 1987, who were young (17 or 18 years of age) and resided in a rural county in a state with a low incidence of reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 135,187). Serum specimens from 15 applicants positive for HIV in this low-prevalence subpopulation were retrieved from a serum bank and retested by two Western blot methods, radioimmunoprecipitation, and an immunoassay constructed from a molecularly cloned and expressed viral envelope polypeptide. Fourteen of the 15 samples were unequivocally positive on all retest assays, and 1 was negative. Thus, the measured rate of false positive diagnoses in this program was 1 in 135,187 persons tested. Factors important in achieving a low false positive rate were redundant, multistep testing algorithm, conservative criteria for interpreting Western blots, the requirement that a second, newly drawn serum specimen be tested for verification before a diagnosis of HIV was considered established, and tight quality control of laboratory testing procedures. We conclude that a screening program for HIV infection in a low-prevalence population can have an acceptably low false positive rate."
3807,0.005,1.0000,"HIV-1 extrachromosomal 2-LTR circles (cc2LTR) are rapidly lost in dividing cell populations and, therefore, might be interpreted as representing new infection and ongoing viral replication. However, recent work demonstrated that cc2LTR persist in infected, growth-arrested T cell lines beyond their predicted half-life as previously determined in dividing cell populations. In this study, the evaluation of the stability of cc2LTR was extended to include primary human macrophages, a natural, non-dividing target of HIV-1. By quantitative real-time PCR, cc2LTR were found to persist out to 21 days post-infection in macrophages infected with both integrase competent and integrase- defective, recombinant HIV-1, whereas in activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes, they rapidly decreased over time. This persistence was associated with persistent, low level expression of the indicator gene, luciferase. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1 cc2LTR in the PBMC of HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive HAART could be due either to ongoing generation of newly infected dividing cells, or persistence of circles in non-dividing cell populations where they appear to be stable. Furthermore, exrachromosomal circular DNA in this cell population could be a source of persisent viral protein expression."

The objective of this study was to evaluate HCW adherence to follow-up after occupational exposure to blood and body fluids at a tertiary care university hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected from 2102 occupational exposures to blood and body fluids reports, obtained from the Infection Control Division of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina/Hospital São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil, occurring between January of 2005 and December of 2011. To evaluate adherence to post-exposure follow-up among the affected HCWs, we took into consideration follow-up visits for serological testing. For HCWs exposed to materials from source patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as from source patients of unknown serological status, follow-up serological testing was scheduled for 3 and 6 months after the accident. For those exposed to materials from source patients co-infected with HIV and HCV, follow-up evaluations were scheduled for 3, 6, and 12 months after the accident. During the study period, there were 2056 accidental exposures for which data regarding the serology of the source patient were available. Follow-up evaluation of the affected HCW was recommended in 612 (29.8%) of those incidents. After the implementation of a post-exposure protocol involving telephone calls and official letters mailed to the affected HCW, adherence to follow-up increased significantly, from 30.5 to 54.0% (P = 0.028). Adherence was correlated positively with being female (P = 0.009), with the source of the exposure being known (P = 0.026), with the source patient being HIV positive (P = 0.029), and with the HCW having no history of such accidents (P = 0.047). Adherence to the recommended serological testing was better at the evaluation scheduled for 3 months after the exposure (the initial evaluation) than at those scheduled for 6 and 12 months after the exposure (P = 0.004). During the study period, there was one confirmed case of HCW seroconversion to HCV positivity. The establishment of a protocol that involves the immediate supervisor of the affected HCWs, in the formal summoning of those HCWs is necessary in order to increase the rate of adherence to post-exposure follow-up.

We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection."

Greece belongs to the intermediate endemicity countries with a trend of decreasing prevalence of HBV infection during the last decade. However, the recent massive immigration to our country may have led to alterations of HBV epidemiology. In this study, we evaluated the epidemiological features of HBV infection in a sample of 3480 patients followed up during the years 1997-2006. Immigrants mainly from Albania represented the 18.6% of the total study population and 56.6% of children. The majority of the patients had no family history of HBV infection (67.3%) or of acute hepatitis (95.4%), no known source of infection (64.6%), with intrafamilial spread accounting for 16.9% of the HBV transmission in adults and 33.9% in children. HBeAg(-) hepatitis B was the predominant form of hepatitis (92.1%) among the Greek patients in contrast to the immigrants where 16.6% were HBeAg(+). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 8.8% of the total population and 0.9% had hepatocellular carcinoma. A high proportion of children were HBeAg(+) (62%), 55% from immigrant families, 25.2% were infected in the perinatal period and had no evidence of disease complications. In conclusion our results showed (a) a changing pattern in the epidemiology of HBV infection in Greece due to the significant number of HBeAg(+) patients, especially among children and (b) a considerable number of patients although aware of their infection, present with advanced disease."

Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least three of five clinical or radiologic criteria.

After specificity and sensitivity testing, three new rapid diagnostic test kits were tested in parallel with six commonly used diagnostic test kits. The Determine HIV-1/2 test had fewer indeterminate or equivocal results than the Capillus HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV Blot 2.2 tests. However, the Determine HIV-1/2 test yielded one false-positive result when compared with the Serodia HIV, HIV Blot 2.2, and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (IMx) HIV tests. The Serodia HBsAg test yielded more false-negative results when compared with the Determine HBsAg diagnostic test kit. The results of the syphilis diagnostic tests evaluated in this clinical trial consistently agreed with those of the rapid plasma reagin test for syphilis. The Determine Syphilis Treponema pallidum (TP) test had three false-positive results compared with the Serodia TP and the Serodia TP x particle agglutination (PA) tests, which had two false-positive results that were confirmed as negative by an ELISA. Application of these serologic tests within this comparative evaluation framework, using the World Health Organization alternative testing strategies, proved to be an effective way to determine serostatus related to HIV, hepatitis B, and syphilis."
4884,0.005,1.0000,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody profiles were studied in 25 HIV-infected patients over periods of up to 56 months. Specific antibodies against CMV antigen components were monitored by complement-fixation (CF) test, EIA, Western blot and a neutralization assay. Three subjects remained CMV seronegative throughout the study. Marked fluctuations were observed in anti-CMV antibodies assayed by the CF test as compared to a control group. Fluctuations on immunoblots of purified virion antigens were also observed in the HIV-infected patients; neutralizing antibodies and anti-CMV nucleocapsid antibodies showed less variability. Seven of 22 individuals exhibited an increase in CF-test titre of up to 64-fold without clinically apparent CMV disease. On Western-blot testing of IgG reactivity with disrupted virions, ten individuals exhibited increasing reactivity to pp65, and only three of these also showed a titre rise in the CF test. In contrast, 7 of 22 showed low reactivity to the pp28 antigen. The homosexual patient group exhibited the highest levels of anti-CMV antibody. In conclusion, many asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects showed fluctuations at different levels of their antibody response to CMV, thought to be indicative of CMV reactivation/reinfection. Western-blot findings indicated that some CMV antibodies increased in level while others were lost."
530,0.005,1.0000,"We report on an investigation designed to compare the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with culture and p24 measurement for the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in infants and children. Forty-five children born of mothers with antibodies to HIV type 1 were studied; P24 antigen was measured in plasma, and HIV-1 proviral DNA was sought in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after amplification by PCR. In 26 cases, blood specimens were cultured for HIV; in all but two instances cultures were established at the same time that the PCR test was performed. Primer pairs in three regions of the proviral genome were used for the PCR test. There was good agreement between the results obtained from PCR tests and from cultures; of 24 children in whom both tests were done at the same time, 10 had positive results on both the culture and the PCR test, 1 had positive results on the PCR test but negative culture results, and 13 had negative results on both tests (concordance 96%). Measurement of p24 antigen in plasma was, in contrast, an insensitive marker of infection: 6 of 12 infants with positive cultures had positive p24 test results, and 8 of 18 infants had positive PCR test results. Sixteen children with subsequent seronegativity for HIV-1 had negative PCR results. This study provides further evidence that the PCR test is a valid alternative to viral culture for the diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection."

There are few reports that associate it with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on initial presentation. A 51-year-old married woman, who was previously healthy and had no risk of HIV infection, presented solely with bilateral simultaneous facial palsy. A positive HIV serology test was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Following a short course of oral prednisolone, the patient recovered completely from facial palsy in three months, even though an antiretroviral treatment was suspended. Exclusion of HIV infection in patients with bilateral facial palsy is essential for early diagnosis and management of HIV. "

A total of 1,078 consecutive serum samples were tested prospectively with the three assays. In addition, we used retrospectively selected panels of serum samples with discrepant results in two different screening tests and with indeterminate or positive Western immunoblot (WB) results, as well as five commercially available HIV-1 seroconversion panels. The new assay showed excellent discriminatory characteristics for the separation of samples from HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative persons according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WB criteria. The sensitivities were 98.1, 92.9, and 96.1% for the new test and the two other assays, respectively, and the specificities were 99.7, 97.9, and 98.1%, respectively. With the seroconversion panels this new test was positive several days earlier than the two other assays; i.e., seroconversion was evident at the peak of p24 antigenemia and often several weeks before WB became positive by the most stringent criteria."
3595,0.005,1.0000,"The results of a study of screening recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by family physicians are reported. Of 209 family practice residents and clinical faculty from the four UCLA-affiliated family practice residency programs surveyed, 110 (53%) responded. Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended."

Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir were evaluated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The authors searched state Medicaid Web sites between 23 June and 7 December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on whether sofosbuvir was covered and the criteria for coverage based on the following categories: liver disease stage, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use. Of the 42 states with known Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir, 74% limit sofosbuvir access to persons with advanced fibrosis (Meta-Analysis of Histologic Data in Viral Hepatitis [METAVIR] fibrosis stage F3) or cirrhosis (F4). One quarter of states require persons co-infected with HCV and HIV to be receiving antiretroviral therapy or to have suppressed HIV RNA levels. Two thirds of states have restrictions based on prescriber type, and 88% include drug or alcohol use in their sofosbuvir eligibility criteria, with 50% requiring a period of abstinence and 64% requiring urine drug screening. Heterogeneity is present in Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir with respect to liver disease staging, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use across the United States. Restrictions do not seem to conform with recommendations from professional organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Current restrictions seem to violate federal Medicaid law, which requires states to cover drugs consistent with their U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels."

The aim of the present study was to understand the miRNA networks and their target genes in the liver of hepatitis B patients involved in HBV replication, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. We investigated differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray in liver biopsy samples from different stages of HBV infection and liver disease (immune-tolerant [n = 8], acute viral hepatitis [n = 8], no fibrosis [n = 16], early [F1+F2, n = 19] or late [F3+F4, n = 14] fibrosis, and healthy controls [n = 7]). miRNA expression levels were analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Analysis of miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks identified 17 miRNAs and 18 target gene interactions with four distinct nodes, each representing a stage-specific gene regulation during disease progression. The immune-tolerant group showed elevated miR-199a-5p, miR-221-3p, and Let-7a-3p levels, which could target genes involved in innate immune response and viral replication. In the acute viral hepatitis group, miR-125b-5p and miR-3613-3p were up, whereas miR-940 was down, which might affect cell proliferation through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway. In early fibrosis, miR-34b-3p, miR-1224-3p, and miR-1227-3p were up, while miR-499a-5p was down, which together possibly mediate chronic inflammation. In advanced fibrosis, miR-1, miR-10b-5p, miR-96-5p, miR-133b, and miR-671-5p were up, while miR-20b-5p and miR-455-3p were down, possibly allowing chronic disease progression. Interestingly, only 8 of 17 liver-specific miRNAs exhibited a similar expression pattern in patient sera."

5737,0.005,1.0000,"Progression of liver fibrosis in patients with hemoglobinopathies is strongly related to the severity of iron overload and the presence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Effective iron chelation therapy and HCV infection eradication may prevent liver complications. The European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend interferon-free regimens for the treatment of HCV infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, data regarding the use of direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) in this patient population are few. This observational study evaluated the safety and efficacy of therapy with DAAs in an Italian cohort of patients with hemoglobinopathies, chronic HCV infection and advanced liver fibrosis. Between March 2015 and December 2016, 139 patients received DAAs and completed 12 weeks of follow up after the end of treatment for the evaluation of sustained virological response (12SVR). The 12SVR (93.5%) was comparable with that typically observed in cirrhotic patients without hemoglobinopathies. Three patients died during the period of observation of causes unrelated to DAAs. One patient did not achieve a virological response and five (3.6%) relapsed during 12 weeks of follow-up after the end of therapy. In addition, patients showed significant reductions in serum ferritin at 12 weeks to levels similar to those observed in a control group of 39 patients with thalassemia major without HCV infection, who adhered to chelation therapy and had no overt iron overload. In conclusion, the use of DAAs appears to be safe and effective in patients with hemoglobinopathies and advanced liver disease due to HCV."
4806,0.005,1.0000,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."

In this review article, we summarise the epidemiology of HIV amongst older people, including data from our local cohort in the city of Sheffield, UK. We discuss specific and practical issues in older patients including why older people are at risk, how to make a diagnosis and the importance of doing so early, guidelines for HIV testing and an update on anti-retroviral therapy including drug interactions and side effects."
5147,0.005,1.0000,"Since the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981, AIDS has always been a global health threat and the leading cause of deaths due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistance and unwanted metabolic side effects. Every day in 2007 an estimated 6850 people were newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over the past 28 years the rapid worldwide spread of AIDS has prompted an intense research effort to discover compounds that could effectively inhibit HIV. The development of new, selective and safe inhibitors for the treatment of HIV, therefore, still remains a high priority for medical research. To the best of our knowledge, the indole derivatives have been considered as one class of promising HIV-1 inhibitors, such as delavirdine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in combination with other antiretrovirals in adults with HIV infection. In this review we focus on the synthesis and anti-HIV-1 activity of indole derivatives, in the meantime, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for some derivatives are also surveyed. It will pave the way for the design of indole derivatives as anti-HIV-1 drugs in the future."
2193,0.005,1.0000,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."

The stigma associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has also been conceptualized as layered. However, researchers have overlooked the fact that HCV adds a layer to the HIV stigma and vice versa. Qualitative interviews with 132 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients were analyzed to explore how they experience the two layers of stigma. Most participants hierarchically ordered the stigmas associated with each disease and regarded HIV as the more stigmatizing of the two. A small number perceived HIV and HCV as equally stigmatizing. The impact of the hierarchical and nonhierarchical ordering of the two stigmas on coinfected patients' felt and enacted stigmatization is explored and implications for interventions are discussed."

Based on in silico studies, two mutant PRs harboring hydrophilic mutations, capable of forming favorable inter- and intra-subunit interactions, were selected: PR(RE) containing Asp25Arg and Gly49Glu mutations, and PR(RER) containing an additional Ile50Arg mutation. The mutants were expressed and tested by PR assays, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and cell culture experiments. The mutant PRs showed dose-dependent inhibition of the wild-type PR in a fluorescent microtiter plate PR assay. Furthermore, both mutants were retained by hexahistidine-tagged wild-type HIV-1 PR immobilized on nickel-chelate affinity resin. For the first time, heterodimerization between wild-type and dominant-negative mutant PRs were also demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy. (1)H-(15)N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence NMR spectra showed that although PR(RE) has a high tendency to aggregate, PR(RER) exists mainly as a folded monomer at 25-35 microM concentration, but in the presence of wild-type PR in a ratio of 1:1, heterodimerization occurs with both mutants. While the recombinant virus containing the PR(RE) sequence showed only very low level of expression, expression of the viral proteins of the virus with the PR(RER) sequence was comparable with that of the wild-type. In cell culture experiments, infectivity of viral particles containing PR(RER) protein was reduced by 82%, at mutant to wild-type infective DNA ratio of 2:1."

Additional data on factors associated with outcomes are needed to better identify patients who may require aggressive care. Using a cohort of 46 HIV-infected patients with histoplasmosis from an underserved city endemic for histoplasmosis, we explored epidemiology, outcomes, and prognostic factors. Histoplasmosis was the 1st recognized manifestation of HIV infection in 12 (26.1%) of 46 patients. Death occurred in 18 (39%) patients within 3 months of diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Fungemia (odds ratio [OR], 12.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-76; P=0.008), renal insufficiency (OR, 11.3; 95% CI, 1.7-77.2; P=0.01), and age (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-0.98; P=0.02) were independent predictors of poor prognosis.

The relation between antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies and HIV-1 infection was explored in 78 neonates born to HIV-infected women. More than 90% of sera had measurable ADCC titers against HIV-1IIIB. Infant titers were closely correlated with maternal titers but were independent of total IgG and total antibody reactive to the same strain in whole virus ELISA. At birth, mean ADCC antibody levels of infants or their mothers were the same for infants who were infected and those who ultimately seroreverted and remained healthy. ADCC antibody titers against HIV-1SF2 were weakly correlated with anti-HIV-1IIIB titers and did not predict protection from HIV-1 infection. High levels of anti-HIV-1 ADCC antibody at birth are not protective against vertical transmission of HIV-1."

In some cases, X4 HIV-1 chemotaxis is CD4 independent, and cross-species transmission might be facilitated by CD4-independent entry, which has been demonstrated for some SIV strains in CD4(-) non-T cells. As expected for CCR5-dependent virus, SIV required CD4 on rhesus and pigtail macaque PBMCs for infection and chemotaxis. However, SIV induced the chemotaxis of human PBMCs in a CD4-independent manner. Furthermore, in contrast to the results of studies using transfected human cell lines, SIV did not require CD4 binding to productively infect primary human PBMCs. CD4-independent lymphocyte and macrophage infection may facilitate cross-species transmission, while reacquisition of CD4 dependence may confer a selective advantage for the virus within new host species."

At the baseline visit, 204 (15.5%) of the 1314 patients had retinol concentrations consistent with deficiency (<1.05 micromol/L). Analysis of Papanicolaou smears showed SILs in 216 (16.4%) of 1314 women. Cervical SILs were found to be associated with retinol concentrations <1.05 micromol/L (multivariate odds ratio [OR], 1.63; P=.04) in a multivariate model, which included human papillomavirus (HPV) status and markers of nutritional status and HIV disease stage. In the subset of women with genital HPV (n=774), a multivariate analysis again revealed a significant independent association between retinol <1.05 micromol/L and cervical SILs (multivariate OR, 1.75; P=.02). Our findings suggest that retinol deficiency may contribute to the development of cervical SILs in HIV-infected women."

One complication observed in approximately 12% of HIV-infected patients is a presumed neuroretinal disorder (NRD), manifested as decreased contrast sensitivity and associated with vague subjective complaints of hazy vision. Pathologically, patients with AIDS even without ocular opportunistic infections have loss of optic nerve axons, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. We explored whether variation in mitochondrial DNA was associated with time to NRD in HIV-infected patients in the Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS cohort. Within the Western European, or ""N"", mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup, haplogroup J, was associated with 80% decrease in the risk of progression to NRD during the study (hazard ratio = 0.20, P = 0.039) and suggested an independent association with protection against NRD in a cross-section of all patients taken at enrollment (1.5% vs. 8.9% in patients with vs. without haplogroup J, respectively, P = 0.05).

6289,0.005,1.0000,"TUTI-16 is a synthetic universal HIV-1 Tat epitope vaccine, designed to induce anti-Tat antibodies that block the function of circulating Tat, an HIV encoded protein secreted by HIV-1 infected cells. Circulating Tat activates CD4 T cells, permitting HIV replication and sustained viremia. Safety, immunogenicity and antiretroviral potential of TUTI-16 were explored in a randomized double-blind dose-escalating study in asymptomatic treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. TUTI-16 was safe, with mild local and systemic injection-related adverse reactions, but the antibody response was barely detectable. Surprisingly, a highly statistically significant reduction of HIV-1 viral load was found in the lowest 30 μg vaccine dose group (p < 0.01) but not at the higher doses. We posited that an anti-Tat antibody response below the limit of detection inhibited HIV viral load at this dose, an effect nullified at higher vaccine doses by activating cytokines induced by adjuvant components in TUTI-16. To clarify this immunogenicity/activation conundrum open label immunogenicity studies were performed in healthy HIV uninfected and aviremic ART-controlled HIV-infected subjects. These established that (1) healthy HIV negative subjects had robust antibody responses, maximal with 1 mg TUTI-16, (2) ART-controlled aviremic HIV infected subjects had similarly robust antibody responses, and (3) adjuvant-induced increases of HIV viral load did not occur in the presence of ART. These studies provided us a basis for the design of a protocol to explore the therapeutic potential of TUTI-16 vaccination to provide drug free control of HIV-1 viremia."
4795,0.005,1.0000,"OX40 ligand (OX40L) co-stimulates and differentiates T cells via ligation of OX40 that is transiently induced on T cells upon activation, resulting in prolonged T cell survival and enhanced cytokine production by T cells. This view has led to the targeting of OX40 as a strategy to boost antigen specific T cells in the context of vaccination. In addition, the ligation of OX40 has also been shown to inhibit infection by CCR5-utilizing (R5) but not CXCR4-utilizing (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) via enhancement of production of CCR5-binding β-chemokines. It was reasoned that human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-1) immortalized T cell lines that express high levels of OX40L could serve as an unique source of physiologically functional OX40L. The fact that HTLV-1+ T cell lines simultaneously also express high levels of OX40 suggested a potential limitation."
6514,0.005,1.0000,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
2021,0.005,1.0000,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."
4894,0.005,1.0000,"OTK18 is a C2H2 type zinc finger protein expressed by human macrophages following HIV infection. OTK18 possesses antiretroviral activity, and its processing products accumulate in the cytoplasm of perivascular brain macrophages in advanced HIV encephalitis cases. Since the regulation of OTK18 expression in living patients following human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection is unknown, our objective is to investigate the first cohort study on OTK18 protein levels in living patients. We assessed OTK18 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 44 living patients with or without HIV-1 infection, with diverse demographic and clinical background. A novel high-sensitivity OTK18 ELISA system was developed to measure OTK18 levels in CSF and plasma using custom made biotinylated monoclonal antibodies against OTK18. The correlation of OTK18 levels with epidemiological parameters was statistically analyzed. Multiple linear regression modeling suggested that plasma OTK18 levels for HIV-1-positive subjects were only about one sixth of that for HIV-1-negative subjects. Higher CD8 T-cell counts were associated with higher levels of OTK18. Using proportional odds logistic regression, we showed that HIV-1-positive patients have significantly lower OTK18 in CSF samples, but we did not observe significant correlation between CD8 T-cell counts and CSF OTK18 levels. OTK18 levels in both plasma and CSF are significantly lower in HIV-1-positive subjects as compared to HIV-1-negative subjects. Plasma OTK18 levels are positively correlated to CD8 T-cell counts, independent of HIV-1 status."

However, given fatigue's pervasive effects on well-being and functioning, the identification of its physiologic and psychological causes and strategies to alleviate it are important to patients' quality of life. As part of a study to understand better how HIV-positive middle-aged and older adults (50+) manage common symptoms, 49 participants discussed in depth their experience with fatigue. Most engaged in both self-care activities and sought the assistance of a health care professional. Frequent strategies included dietary changes, vitamins, modification of routines, rest, exercise, and prescribed medications for anemia, Vitamin B(12) deficiency, or testosterone deficiency. Complementary and alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, massage, herbal remedies, special juices) was also commonly used. Participants often used multiple strategies to alleviate their fatigue, possibly because of their tendency to attribute it to multiple causes. These HIV-positive older adults were also apt to view fatigue as an indirect indicator of their overall health status and immune functioning. This may explain why many of the coping strategies they used could be considered approaches to improving their overall health status as a means to increasing their energy levels. Health care professionals can play an important role in helping HIV-positive individuals manage their fatigue. The majority of participants tried to implement the coping suggestions offered by health care professionals, as well as those from family, friends, and support group members."

Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents.

8724,0.005,1.0000,"In order to achieve the programmatic goals established in the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, virologic suppression remains the most important outcome within the HIV care continuum for individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Therefore, clinicians have dedicated substantial resources to improve adherence and clinic retention for individuals on ART; however, these efforts should be focused first on those most at risk of morbidity and mortality related to AIDS. Our study aimed to characterize the factors that are associated with AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) amongst people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are poorly adherent or retained in care in order to identify those at highest risk of poor clinical outcomes. We recruited 99 adult PLHIV with a history of poor adherence to ART, poor clinic attendance, or unsuppressed viral load (VL) from the Infectious Disease Program (IDP) of the Grady Health System in Atlanta, Georgia between January and May 2011 to participate in a survey investigating the acceptability of a financial incentive for improving adherence. Clinical outcomes including the number of ADI episodes in the last five years, VLs, and CD4 counts were abstracted from medical records. Associations between survey items and number of ADIs were performed using chi-square analysis. In our study, 36.4% of participants had ≥1 ADI in the last five years. The most common ADIs were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, and esophageal candidiasis. Age <42.5 years (OR 2.52, 95% CI = 1.08-5.86), male gender (OR 3.51, 95% CI = 1.08-11.34), CD4 nadir <200 cells/µL (OR 11.92, 95% CI = 1.51-94.15), unemployment (OR 3.54, 95% CI = 1.20-10.40), and travel time to clinic <30 minutes (OR 2.80, 95% CI = 1.20-6.52) were all significantly associated with a history of ≥1 ADI in the last five years. Awareness of factors associated with ADIs may help clinicians identify which poorly adherent PLHIV are at highest risk of HIV-related morbidity."

The study design was a retrospective cohort, analyzing 187 patients from Recife metropolitan region (Pernambuco, Brazil): among these 160 obtained complete suppression of HIV-1 replication (responders) and were compared to 27 non-responders, which underwent virological failure. There was no association between CYP2B6, SLC22A1, and SLCO3A1 SNPs and virological failure. Using logistic regression analysis, a significant association was detected between rs1045642 (3435C>T, ABCB1) and rs212091 (198217T>C; 3'-UTR, ABCC1) with virological failure of first-line antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors, when controlled by clinical factors, such as sex, age and race. The present results could contribute to unravel the influence of genetic background in anti-HIV-1 therapy outcome and help in treatment personalization of Northeast Brazil HIV infected patients. "

Twenty of 40 men (50 percent) with AIDS were hypogonadal. Mean serum testosterone concentrations in both ARC (292 +/- 70 ng/dl) and AIDS (401 +/- 30 ng/dl) men were significantly less than in asymptomatic (567 +/- 49 ng/dl) or normal men (608 +/- 121 ng/dl). Of these hypogonadal men, 18 of 24 (75 percent) had hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Seven of eight hypogonadal men (88 percent) had a normal gonadotropin response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone administration. Hypogonadism correlated with lymphocyte depletion and weight loss. Adrenal cortisol reserve, evaluated by adrenocorticotropin stimulation, was normal in 36 of 39 patients (92 percent) with AIDS. Indices of thyroid function were normal with the exception of one ARC man with a low free thyroxine index. In conclusion, hypogonadism is common in men with HIV infection and may be the first or most sensitive endocrine abnormality."
7608,0.005,1.0000,"The fourth conserved region (C4) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) surface glycoprotein has been shown to participate in CD4 binding and to influence viral tropism (A. Cordonnier, L. Montagnier, and M. Emerman, Nature [London] 340:571-574, 1989). To define the role of the corresponding region of HIV-2, we introduce single amino acid changes into the C4 sequence of HIV-2ROD. The effects of these mutations on glycoprotein function and on virus infectivity have been examined. We have shown that the tryptophan residue at position 428 is necessary primarily for CD4 binding. The isoleucine residue at position 421 is necessary for the establishment of productive infection in the promonocytic cell line U937, while it is dispensable to some extent for infection of primary T lymphocytes or the lymphocytic cell line SUP-T1. This replication defect correlated with the failure of the Ile-421-to-Thr (Ile-421-->Thr) mutant glycoprotein to form syncytia in U937 cells. DNA analysis of revertant viruses revealed that a strong selective pressure was exerted on residue 421 of the surface glycoprotein to allow HIV-2 infection of U937 cells. These results demonstrate that this region of HIV-2 plays an important role in determining fusion efficiency in a cell-dependent manner and consequently can influence viral tropism."

Modifications of the function of the RB tumor suppressor gene, which regulates the cell cycle, could provide such a mechanism. In the present study, the expression of the protein product of RB, pRB, was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining in HCC tissues from 25 patients from China and the United States, adjacent nontumorous liver from 19 of those patients, five human HCC cell lines, three human hepatoblastoma cell lines, and five specimens of normal human liver. Representative samples were also evaluated by western blot. Altered expression of RB was detected in eight HCC tissues (pRB undetectable in five HCCs and detected in < 1% of nuclei of HCC cells in three others); all eight had detectable hepatitis B surface or core antigen in the adjacent nontumorous liver, indicating active HBV infection. pRB was detected in 10-95% of nuclei (normal expression) in the remaining 17 HCCs, and in many nuclei in all 19 nontumorous livers, and in the 5 normal livers. No pRB staining was detected in the nuclei of three HCC cell lines, but pRB was detected in > 90% of nuclei of the other HCC and hepatoblastoma cell lines. The relationship of pRB expression to mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene was also examined. The absence of detectable nuclear pRB by immunohistochemical staining was associated with the presence of presumed mutant p53 detected by immunohistochemical staining in four out of five HCC cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A variety of cell types was studied including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a CD4-positive T-cell line, and a CD4-positive human monocyte cell line. The combination of rsT4 and AZT inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and multiplicities of infection in several different HIV-1 replication assays. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique using a computer analysis.

The PGE producer cells were among the population of plastic-adherent PBMC. Transformed B lymphocyte cell lines spontaneously derived from the blood of patients with AIDS secrete a factor that stimulates normal donor adherent PBMC to produce PGE.

9917,0.005,1.0000,"We attempted to determine whether HIV-1 developed resistance to (--)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine ((--)-3TC or 3TC, lamivudine) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during therapy with 3TC. Genotypic analysis of HIV-1 strains isolated from 6 patients receiving 3TC revealed that as early as 2 months of therapy, HIV-1 developed a Met to Val amino acid substitution at codon 184 (Met184-->Val) in the reverse transcriptase-coding region of the pol gene. A detailed study of a series of HIV-1 strains isolated from a patient demonstrated that Met at codon 184 was first substituted with Ile by 2 weeks of 3TC therapy, followed by the substitution with Val by 8 weeks. All HIV-1 strains with the Met184-->Val substitution were profoundly less susceptible to 3TC (1800- to 5500-fold decreased sensitivity) as compared to pretherapy virus strains. These strains were also moderately less sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (4.5- to 9-fold), but more sensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (2- to 14-fold). A decrease in viremia levels and an increase in CD4 counts were observed early in therapy; however, these changes were only transient. Our data suggest that reversal of such beneficial changes is associated with the Met184-->Val substitution of the pol gene of HIV-1. The data also suggest that 3TC, as a single agent, may induce virologic and immunologic improvement in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, but only transiently."

This study was conducted to determine if the presence of precore mutants affect spontaneous or interferon (IFN)-induced hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) clearance. Sera from 201 hepatitis B e antigen positive Chinese patients (including 106 who participated in a controlled trial of IFN therapy) with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of HBV DNA after amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Forty-three (21%) patients had M1 (T-1856), and 20 patients (10%) had M2 (A-1896). During a follow-up period of 1 to 7 years, 75%, 28%, and 26% of those with M2 (A-1896), M1 (T-1856), and wild type sequence respectively, cleared HBeAg (P < .0001). Eighteen (67%) of 27 patients with wild-type sequence but none of 10 patients who had M1 (T-1856) in their initial samples developed M2 (A-1896) after loss of HBeAg (P < .0001).

110,0.005,1.0000,"A variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) having a specific mutation within the S gene has been found to infect vaccinees. To know whether similar variants were involved in Japan, we analyzed two cases of maternal transmission of HBV in infants immunized with hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine. DNA clones of HBV S genes were propagated from patients and family members and sequenced. In one family, the DNA clones from the baby patient had a Gly-to-Arg mutation at the 145th codon of the S gene, whereas those from her mother had no such mutations. In the other family, all the DNA clones obtained from the two infected children had the 145th codon intact, but they had a missense mutation at the 126th codon of the S gene, causing an amino acid substitution of Asn for Thr or Ile. This same mutation was observed in 12 of 17 clones of DNA obtained from their mother. In comparison with the wild type HBV-derived hepatitis B surface antigen, the two types of S gene mutations, either at the 145th or the 126th codon, were associated with a significant decrease in the antigenicity of some determinants on the hepatitis B surface antigen, measured by MAb. Amino acid substitution at these sites, therefore, would have induced the escape from conventional vaccines that were S gene products of wild type HBV and also from hepatitis B immune globulin, whose main components were probably also antibodies against the S gene products expressed by wild type HBV."

Treatment was performed primarily surgically by means of laparoscopic Heller myotomy with an anterior 180° semifundoplication according to Dor.Histopathology of the specimens taken from the lower esophageal sphincter high-pressure zone proved alterations with abundant connective tissue and only scarce parts of the smooth muscular system without inflammatory infiltrations. In addition, the ganglia cells of the myenteric plexus as well as the interstitial cells of Cajal were significantly reduced. Interestingly, specific gene sequences of the hepatitis C virus could be detected in the esophageal tissue specimen.

In the two remaining patients, we found a Met(550)-to-Ile change that was associated in only one case with a Leu(526)-to-Met mutation.

This virus (SHIVKU-1) is highly pathogenic when inoculated into other macaques. DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified products revealed a total of 5 nucleotide changes in the LTR while vif had 2 consensus amino acid changes. The gag, vif, and vpx had no consensus amino acid substitutions, whereas vpr had 1 consensus substitution. The tat and rev genes of the HXB2 region of SHIVKU-1 had 2 and 1 consensus amino acid changes, respectively. The vpu gene of the HXB2 region of SHIV, which originally had an ACG at the beginning of the gene, reverted to an initiation ATG codon and in addition contained a consensus amino acid substitution at position 69 of this protein. As expected, the majority of the nucleotide substitutions were found in the env and nef genes. Thirteen and 5 amino acid changes were predicted for the corresponding Env and Nef proteins, respectively. In addition, one-third of the env gene clones isolated from the SHIVKU-1 stock had a 5-amino-acid deletion in the V4 region. Using three independent assays, we determined that the changes in the SHIVKU-1 were associated with an increase in the efficiency of replication in macrophages. The strikingly few consensus changes in the virus suggest that conversion of this virus to one capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques was associated with relatively few changes in the viral envelope and/or accessory genes. These results will provide the basis for the development of a pathogenic, molecular clone of SHIV capable of causing AIDS in pig-tailed macaques."

Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."

Most tumor tissues contained integrated viral DNA; in none was extrachromosomal HBV DNA detected. Integrated HBV DNS was also found in peritumor liver tissue in the majority of patients. However, liver of patients either with or without peripheral viremia also contained free HBV DNA and replicative intermediates. In three nonviremic patients with replicative HBV DNA in liver, viral core antigen expression was markedly reduced or absent, whereas viral envelope protein (surface antigen) expression was normal. In one case, replicative intermediates in liver were sensitive to DNase I digestion, indicating that viral DNA was not encapsidated in normal viral core particles. These results suggest that decreased or defective core antigen production can lead to reduced viremia associated with blocked virus assembly/secretion and accumulation of unencapsidated HBV DNA replicative intermediates in the liver cell. Accumulation of such HBV DNA molecular forms in the liver may lead to an increased propensity for HBV DNA to integrate into the host genome, which has been found with high frequency in hepatic neoplasms from patients infected with hepatitis B virus."

Vpr was also shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells and budding yeasts, an effect that was proposed to lead to growth arrest and cell killing in budding yeasts and apoptosis in human cells. In this study, we used a genetic selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify hexameric peptides that suppress the growth arrest phenotype mediated by Vpr. Fifteen selected glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused peptides were found to overcome to different extents Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Amino acid analysis of the inhibitory peptide sequences revealed the conservation of a di-tryptophan (diW) motif. DiW-containing GST-peptides interacted with Vpr in GST pull-down assays, and their level of interaction correlated with their ability to overcome Vpr-mediated growth arrest. Importantly, Vpr-binding GST-peptides were also found to alleviate Vpr-mediated apoptosis and G(2) arrest in HIV-1-producing CD4(+) T cell lines. Furthermore, they co-localized with Vpr and interfered with its nuclear translocation. Overall, this study defines a class of diW-containing peptides that inhibit HIV-1 Vpr biological activities most likely by interacting with Vpr and interfering with critical protein interactions."
5634,0.005,1.0000,"Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are among the most common genetic alterations found in many different human malignancies, including those of the colon, lung, and breast. Alterations in wild-type p53 lead to loss of the suppressor function and thus contribute to tumorigenesis. The potential role of p53 mutations in a sampling of B-cell lymphomas, the majority of which were associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was investigated. Twenty-six biopsy specimens from immunocompromised patients, including allograft recipients and patients with AIDS, Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection, in comparison with three Burkitt lymphomas and four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines were analyzed. Mutation in p53 was detected in all four Burkitt lymphoma cell lines as well as the three Burkitt lymphoma biopsy specimens. In patients with AIDS, 5 of 10 lymphomas were EBV positive, and 1 had a mutation in p53. Mutation in p53 was not detected in 14 EBV-positive lymphomas which arose in transplant recipients. These data indicate that with the exception of Burkitt lymphomas, p53 mutations are not involved in the majority EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas which develop in immunocompromised patients."
8068,0.005,1.0000,"Genomic hypermutation of RNA viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can be provoked by intrinsic and extrinsic pressures, which lead to the inhibition of viral replication and/or the progression of viral diversity. Human APOBEC3G was identified as an HIV-1 restriction factor, which edits nascent HIV-1 DNA by inducing G-to-A hypermutations and debilitates the infectivity of vif-deficient HIV-1. On the other hand, HIV-1 Vif protein has the robust potential to degrade APOBEC3G protein. Although subsequent investigations have revealed that lines of APOBEC3 family proteins have the capacity to mutate HIV-1 DNA, it remains unclear whether these endogenous APOBEC3s, including APOBEC3G, contribute to mutations of vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus in vivo and, if so, what is the significance of these mutations. In this study, we use a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse (NOG-hCD34 mouse) model and demonstrate the predominant accumulation of G-to-A mutations in vif-proficient HIV-1 provirus displaying characteristics of APOBEC3-mediated mutagenesis. Notably, the APOBEC3-associated G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 DNA that leads to the termination of translation was significantly observed. We further provide a novel insight suggesting that HIV-1 G-to-A hypermutation is independently induced by individual APOBEC3 proteins. In contrast to the prominent mutation in intracellular proviral DNA, viral RNA in plasma possessed fewer G-to-A mutations. Taken together, these results provide the evidence indicating that endogenous APOBEC3s are associated with G-to-A mutation of HIV-1 provirus in vivo, which can result in the abrogation of HIV-1 infection."
7382,0.005,1.0000,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection can now be treated effectively in many patients in the developed world, using combinations of antiretroviral therapeutics, called Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART). However, despite prolonged treatment with HAART, the persistence of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs harboring transcriptionally silent but replication-competent proviruses represents the major hurdle to virus eradication. These latently infected cells are a permanent source for virus reactivation and lead to a rebound of the viral load after interruption of HAART. Therefore, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating proviral latency and reactivation should lead to rational strategies aimed at purging these cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. This review summarizes our current knowledge and understanding of the elements involved in HIV-1 transcriptional reactivation: (1) the site of integration; (2) the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNFalpha) and binds to two kappaB sites in the HIV-1 promoter region; (3) the specific remodeling of a single nucleosome (called nuc-1 and located immediately downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site under latency conditions) upon activation of the HIV-1 promoter; (4) post-translational acetylation of histones and of non-histone proteins (following treatment with deacetylases inhibitors, which induce viral transcription and nuc-1 remodeling); and (5) the viral trans-activator Tat, which promotes transcription by mediating the recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter of histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes required for nucleosome disruption and transcriptional processivity. Finally, this review highlights experimental therapies aimed at administrating HIV-1 gene expression activators (such as HDAC inhibitors) combined with an effective HAART in order to reactivate and decrease/eliminate the pool of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs"

The efficacy of an additional booster dose in children with immune recovery on HAART remains unknown. This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response. HIV-infected children with immune recovery after HAART are likely to benefit from three-dose HBV re-vaccination."

Recently, three novel antiretrovirals [raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and darunavir (DRV)] were introduced into the market almost simultaneously, and salvage regimens containing these three antiretrovirals have been reported to exhibit strong potency against drug-resistant HIV-1 infection. However, the sustainability of such regimens remains unclear, particularly for patients infected with multidrug-resistant viruses. Here we report a case of super-multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection which has been successfully controlled by novel combination therapy including RAL, ETR, and DRV for over 2 years, indicating that the novel combination could become an ultimate weapon against drug-resistant HIV infection and could alter the landscape of HIV salvage therapy."
5762,0.005,1.0000,"The worldwide implementation of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) raised great hopes among policy makers and health organisations about the positive changes it would bring about in attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS, as well as for infected people's lives. A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "
6974,0.005,1.0000,"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis receive multiple blood transfusions and, thus, are susceptible to infections transmitted through blood and blood products, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Baltimore and Boston in 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study. Repeatedly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot analysis. Among 435 patients in Baltimore, 12 (2.8%) were seropositive by both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Among 90 patients in Boston, three (3.3%) were seropositive. Among 100 frozen serum samples obtained from another Boston hemodialysis population in 1980, only one was seropositive. Many repeatedly ELISA-positive specimens were observed in each of the three groups studied, especially the serum samples that had been stored at -30 degrees C to -70 degrees C for four years. Most were nonspecifically reactive as demonstrated by reactivity with an H9-control ELISA plate. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, many of whom have received frequent transfusions in the past, are at increased risk for prior infection with HIV. Serologic testing for either screening or case-finding purposes must be conducted with great attention to specificity; serum samples frozen for prolonged periods are especially likely to be nonspecifically ELISA positive. These findings have implications concerning case-finding purposes, dialysis procedures, renal transplantation, and seroepidemiologic research."

Amplification of at least one gene was successful for 144 isolates. All three genes were obtained for 136 isolates. Subtyping showed that CRF01_AE was predominant (130 cases). According to the ANRS September 2004 list, polymorphism substitutions (>50% versus the subtype B consensus) of CRF01_AE at drug resistance positions were observed only in protease: I13V (81%), E35D (87%), M36I (100%), R41K (96%), and H69K (100%). Two strains bore one major resistance mutation to PIs: M46I and N88D. Five other strains carried drug resistance mutations to RTIs: K70R (one strain), V75M (three strains), and K101E (one strain).

2159,0.005,1.0000,"Our previous study demonstrated the anti-apoptosis function of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vpu gene product in normal CD4+ T lymphocytes. In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."
233,0.005,1.0000,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary infection that occurs in immunocompromised individuals and HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 cell count. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used as the first-line agent for treatment, but mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene render potential resistance to sulfamide. Despite advances of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to occur in HIV-infected patients with late presentation for cART or virological and immunological failure after receiving cART. Areas covered: This review summarizes the diagnosis and first-line and alternative treatment and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. Articles for this review were identified through searching PubMed. Search terms included: 'Pneumocystis pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'primaquine', 'trimetrexate', 'dapsone', 'pentamidine', 'atovaquone', 'echinocandins', 'human immunodeficiency virus infection', 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'resistance to sulfamide' and combinations of these terms. We limited the search to English language papers that were published between 1981 and March 2017. We screened all identified articles and cross-referenced studies from retrieved articles. Expert commentary: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will continue to be the first-line agent for Pneumocystis pneumonia given its cost, availability of both oral and parenteral formulations, and effectiveness or efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis. Whether resistance due to mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene compromises treatment effectiveness remains controversial. Continued search for effective alternatives with better safety profiles for Pneumocystis pneumonia is warranted."
36,0.005,1.0000,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The genomes contained deletions in the C gene, deletions in the pre-S1/2 region frequently removing the pre-S2 initiation codon, premature termination codons in the pre-S1 or S region, and/or deletions/insertions in the X gene/core promoter. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern. Efficient intracellular trans-complementation probably enables high virus replication in vivo."
8085,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) invades the central nervous system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50% of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV-1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD4(+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV-1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to purge these viral reservoirs and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS."
7335,0.005,1.0000,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."
1704,0.005,1.0000,"The -1G mutant HBV is more prevalent in individuals co-infected with HIV/HBV than in individuals infected with HBV alone and in some cases is the dominant virus in circulation. This mutant is created by the deletion of a dGMP (-1G) from the guanine rich homopolymer sequence located at nts 2,085-2,090 (numbering from EcoRI site as position 1) in the HBV core gene. This deletion causes a frameshift generating a premature stop codon at (64) Asn in the HBV core gene (codon 93 in the precore gene), that truncates the precore protein, precursor of the secreted hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg), and the core protein which forms the viral nucleocapsid. However, the replication phenotype of the -1G mutant HBV is unknown. An in vitro cell culture model in which hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with infectious cDNAs was used to show that the -1G mutant HBV is incapable of autonomous replication and, as expected, replication was restored to wild-type (wt) levels by supplying HBV core protein in trans. Although the -1G mutation had no deleterious effect on intracellular HBV-DNA levels, high levels of -1G mutant HBV relative to wt HBV reduced virus secretion and HBeAg secretion relative to empty vector controls. Importantly, the -1G mutant HBV also caused intracellular retention of truncated precore protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Together, these effects may be contributing to the increased pathology observed in the setting of HIV/HBV co-infection."
7469,0.005,1.0000,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."
7846,0.005,1.0000,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."

The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

SALT-3 showed atypical T cell markers such as CD1-CD2-CD3-CD4+CD5+CD7+CD8-CD19-CD20-CD25+HLA-DR+. T cell receptor alpha/beta and gamma/delta were undetectable. Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) particles were seen on SALT-3 cells by electron microscopic analysis. HTLV-I gag p19, proviral DNA and mRNA of HTLV-I genes were also detected in the cells. Chromosome analysis showed abnormal karyotypes as 47, XY, partial trisomy of No.3 chromosome, and trisomy of No. 7 chromosome. Furthermore, SALT-3 were susceptible to the infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the cells were rapidly killed after HIV-1 infection. This newly established HTLV-I-infected human T cell line would be a useful tool to study biological activities of atypical type of ATL cells and to examine the cytotoxic effects of HIV-1 and it's modulators."

These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."
812,0.005,1.0000,"Positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), composed of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and cyclin T, is a global transcription factor for eukaryotic gene expression, as well as a key factor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription elongation. P-TEFb phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), facilitating the transition from nonprocessive to processive transcription elongation. Recently, the bromodomain protein Brd4 has been shown to interact with the low-molecular-weight, active P-TEFb complex and recruit P-TEFb to the HIV type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. However, the subsequent events through which Brd4 regulates CDK9 kinase activity and RNAP II-dependent transcription are not clearly understood. Here we provide evidence that Brd4 regulates P-TEFb kinase activity by inducing a negative pathway. Moreover, by analyzing stepwise initiation and elongation complexes, we demonstrate that P-TEFb activity is regulated in the transcription complex. Brd4 induces phosphorylation of CDK9 at threonine 29 (T29) in the HIV transcription initiation complex, inhibiting CDK9 kinase activity. P-TEFb inhibition is transient, as Brd4 is released from the transcription complex between positions +14 and +36. Removal of the phosphate group at T29 by an incoming phosphatase released P-TEFb activity, resulting in increased RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and transcription. Finally, we present chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showing that CDK9 with phosphorylated T29 is associated with the HIV promoter region in the integrated and transcriptionally silent HIV genome."
8479,0.005,1.0000,"The low concentration and complex sample matrix of many clinical and environmental viral samples presents a significant challenge in the development of low cost, point-of-care viral assays. To address this problem, we investigated the use of a microfluidic passive magnetic separator combined with on-chip mixer to both purify and concentrate whole-particle human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. Virus-containing plasma samples are first mixed to allow specific binding of the viral particles with antibody-conjugated superparamagnetic nanoparticles, and several passive mixer geometries were assessed for their mixing efficiencies. The virus-nanoparticle complexes are then separated from the plasma in a novel magnetic separation chamber, where packed micrometer-sized ferromagnetic particles serve as high magnetic gradient concentrators for an externally applied magnetic field. Thereafter, a viral lysis buffer was flowed through the chip and the released HIV proteins were assayed off-chip. Viral protein extraction efficiencies of 62% and 45% were achieved at 10 and 30 muL/min throughputs, respectively. More importantly, an 80-fold concentration was observed for an initial sample volume of 1 mL and a 44-fold concentration for an initial sample volume of 0.5 mL. The system is broadly applicable to microscale sample preparation of any viral sample and can be used for nucleic acid extraction as well as 40-80-fold enrichment of target viruses."

Here we show that TRAF2, TRAF5 and TRAF6 interact with the HIV-1 Nef protein, an immunomodulatory viral protein expressed and released by cells infected by the virus. We also found that TRAF2 and TRAF5 interact with the HCV Core protein. Interestingly, we observed that HIV-1 Nef interacts with HCV Core. The activation of TRAF (2, 5, 6) - mediated by HIV-1 Nef and HCV Core - enhanced the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and increased HIV-1 replication in monocyte- derived macrophages (MDMs). The knockdown of TRAF2, TRAF5 and TRAF6 resulted in decreased NF-κB activation and reduced HIV-1 replication in MDMs. Our results reveal a mechanism by which the activation of the TRAF pathway by HIV-1 Nef and HCV Core favors the replication of HIV-1 in macrophages and could be a critical factor for optimal replication of HIV-1 in macrophages of HIV-HCV-coinfected patients.

6533,0.005,1.0000,"The complex interaction between HIV-1 infection and Mycobacterium avium was studied. Viral burden was assessed, as well as immune response to HIV-1 in the context of Myco. avium infections. We also examined serum cytokine levels and cytokine release by blood mononuclear cells in HIV-1-infected subjects, infected or not with Myco. avium. Undetectable serum levels of IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-6 were found in normal controls and in groups I, II and III of HIV-1-infected subjects. Moderate levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 were found in the sera of group IV patients. When group IV was subdivided into subjects with and without Myco. avium infections, subjects with Myco, avium infections were shown to have higher serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 than those with other infections. Blood mononuclear cells from controls and HIV subjects were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and cytokine levels assessed. Cells from group II patients were shown to secrete normal levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, and lower levels of IL-1 beta; group III subjects released higher levels of IL-6. Patients in group IV had blood cells that released elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and lower levels of IL-1 beta. Group IV subjects with Myco. avium infections had blood cells that released higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 than group IV subjects with other infections. Assessment of viral burden in cells of HIV-1-infected subjects revealed that Myco. avium-infected subjects had a higher level of virus burden and a lower level of lymphoproliferative response to an inactivated gp120-depleted HIV-1 antigen than AIDS subjects with other infections. These data suggest that Myco. avium infections in HIV-1-infected subjects hasten the progression of viral disease, enhance cytokine release and contribute to the anergy to viral antigens."

The ART Cohort Collaboration, which includes 13 cohort studies from Europe and North America, was established to fill this knowledge gap."
8235,0.005,1.0000,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat-directed transcription. While in most cell types, activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR, astrocytic glial cells support TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat. This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer, a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) present in many cell types, including T lymphocytes. Tat transactivation mediated by the kappa B domain is sufficient to allow replication of TAR-deleted mutant HIV-1 in astrocytes. The present study demonstrates the existence of kappa B-specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF-kappa B. The novel astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column, while prototypical NF-kappa B from Jurkat T cells is not. In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding factors activate transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the kappa B domain. Moreover, TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with kappa B-binding activity. The importance of the central nervous system-enriched kappa B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed."
4331,0.005,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) coinfect many individuals in North America and in parts of Africa. Infection with HIV is a leading risk factor for the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that HIV infection of common or adjacent cells would stimulate replication and spread of KSHV. Infection of a primary effusion lymphoma cell line by vesicular stomatitis virus type G-pseudotyped HIV type 1 led to a rapid induction of lytic-phase KSHV replication. Induction of lytic KSHV replication by HIV required active replication of HIV. The addition of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine or the protease inhibitor indinavir to the culture prevented HIV spread and inhibited the associated induction of KSHV lytic replication. Lytic replication occurred in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected cells within the culture, and could be induced in uninfected cells via a soluble factor released from the HIV-infected cells. Transmission of infectious KSHV to an uninfected target cell was enhanced by HIV replication and was inhibited by antiretroviral drugs. These results may have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of KS in individuals coinfected with KSHV and HIV."
7508,0.005,1.0000,"Human papilloma virus (HPV)-like particles (VLPs) have been used as a vaccine to prevent HPV infection. Recent studies demonstrate that VLPs bind to dendritic cells and induce the expression of antiviral cytokines such as interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IFN-gamma. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of VLPs on HIV-1 replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. Here, we show that VLPs suppress the replication of both X4 and R5 HIV-1 without affecting the expression of CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5. Soluble factor(s) released by PBMCs and macrophages on VLPs treatment inhibited HIV-1 replication. To determine the inhibitory factors, DNA microarray analysis was performed using VLP-treated PBMCs and macrophages. VLPs induced the genes associated with IFN induction, immune responses, and antiviral responses, among with the recently described cytokine IL-27. Subsequently, IL-27 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in PBMCs, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages. Taken together, our studies identify a novel role of IL-27 in restricting HIV-1 replication and suggest that further examination of the inhibitory property of IL-27 may pave the way for a novel therapy for HIV-1 infection."
3844,0.005,1.0000,"In the United States, black men who have sex with men (MSM) account for a disproportionate number of new cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). From 2001 to 2006, the number of HIV/AIDS cases among black MSM aged 13--24 years in 33 states increased 93%. In 2006, more new AIDS cases among black MSM were diagnosed in the South than in all other U.S. census regions combined. In November 2007, the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH) reported to CDC an increase in the number of young black MSM who received diagnoses of HIV infection at a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Jackson, Mississippi. MSDH and CDC conducted a survey of 29 young black MSM in the three-county Jackson area who received diagnoses of HIV infection during January 2006--April 2008 to characterize risk behavior and HIV testing behavior. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which found that, during the 12 months before receiving their HIV infection diagnosis, 20 (69%) of the 29 participants had unprotected anal intercourse, but only three (10%) of the 29 thought they were likely or very likely to acquire HIV infection in their lifetimes. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether this sample is illustrative of other groups of black MSM at high risk for HIV infection, especially in the South. Targeted interventions that decrease HIV risk behaviors among black MSM should be developed, implemented, and evaluated to reduce HIV transmission."
6765,0.005,1.0000,The incidence of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been monitored since 1984 in an area probability sample of homosexual/bisexual men drawn from a six-kilometer square area of San Francisco where the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been most severe. Annualized HIV seroconversion rates in previously uninfected cohort members have declined by 88 per cent from 5.9 per cent during the first six months of 1985 to 0.7 per cent during the last six months of 1987. Concurrent declines of approximately 80 per cent in the prevalence of sexual behaviors associated with HIV transmission were also observed in the sample.
3526,0.005,1.0000,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."
4260,0.005,1.0000,"African countries are rapidly adopting guidelines to offer antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all HIV-infected individuals, regardless of CD4 count. For this policy of 'treat all' to succeed, millions of new patients must be initiated on ART as efficiently as possible. Studies have documented high losses of treatment-eligible patients from care before they receive their first dose of antiretrovirals (ARVs), due in part to a cumbersome, resource-intensive process for treatment initiation, requiring multiple clinic visits over a several-week period."
9130,0.005,1.0000,"An increase of sexually transmitted shigellosis is currently being reported in developed countries. In addition, travel-related shigellosis can introduce resistant strains that could be disseminated within this new scenario. Epidemiological features and antimicrobial susceptibility of shigellosis depending on where infection was acquired were investigated. From 2008 to 2013, subjects with shigellosis were studied. Patients were classified according to acquisition of Shigella as traveler's diarrhea (TD) or domestically acquired diarrhea (DAD). Ninety cases of shigellosis were identified: 76 corresponding to the TD group and 14 to the DAD group. In the DAD group, most of patients were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM), being shigellosis associated to male sex (P = 0.007) and HIV infection (P < 0.0001). S. sonnei (47.8%) and S. flexneri (42.2%) were the predominant species. The highest resistance was detected for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (81.8%), followed by ampicillin (AMP) (37.8%) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) (23.3%). Resistant Shigella strains were more frequent in subjects with TD than those with DAD, although only for CIP the difference was significant (P = 0.034). Continuous monitoring of patients with shigellosis is necessary to control the spread of resistant Shigella strains and for effective therapy. Men with shigellosis who have not traveled to an endemic area should be screened for HIV infection. "
4473,0.005,1.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health concern where about 3% of the world's population is infected globally. In Ethiopia the prevalence ranges from 0.9 to 1.3% in the general populations. Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) patients due to their weak immune response are heavily affected by the virus. There is no data on magnitude and associated risk factors for HCV infection among voluntary counseling, testing center and anti retroviral treatment clinic Attendants in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the sero-prevalence and associated risk factors for HCV infection among voluntary counseling testing and anti retroviral treatment clinic attendants Adwa general hospital."
