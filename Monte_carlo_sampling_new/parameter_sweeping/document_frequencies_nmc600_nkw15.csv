7098,0.07,42.0000,"Only some twenty years has passed since the first discovery of severe immunodeficiency among previously healthy homosexual men through the discovery of the causing virus and till the status today where the knowledge on the HIV virus and the pathogenic mechanisms induced by the virus are extensive, though still incomplete. Furthermore, steadily better treatments have been introduced at a paste that is probably without precedents. These processes have been fuelled by various molecular biological methods. The abilities to quantify viremia and to sequence virus and hence describe the evolution of the virus represent valuable tools for understanding the pathogenic processes. The current thesis describes some of the findings obtained. While it was initially thought that the virological profile mimicked the clinical with an acute infection followed for years by clinical latency and only after on average ten years signs of severe immunodeficiency, this understanding has been revised. There is no virological latency. The viral replication is on going throughout the infection. However, the virological profile does resemble the clinical. Viremia is high shortly after infection; hereafter declines, and stabilises around what has been termed the viral set point. This level of viremia is predictive of the clinical course of the infection. We have shown that the viremic levels, measured both as HIV RNA load and proviral DNA load, early in infection carry significant information about the course of the infection. It is; however, not only early viral loads that carry prognostic information, also viral load during late-stage infection is clinically informative. Viral load measurements have evolved as the major tool for monitoring the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy. HIV RNA has been shown to be a good surrogate marker for the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. How to use the measurements most optimally has however not been fully delineated. Various methods for describing virological response might yield different results, and it is recommended that the pros and cons of the various methods be investigated. In a cohort of patients who had obtained good virological suppression on antiretroviral therapy followed prospectively for two years we found that only few patients experienced high-grade viremia. Furthermore, baseline HIV DNA differed between the patients with various longitudinal HIV RNA profiles. The patients with the most pronounced HIV RNA suppression had lowest proviral load at baseline, with a clear gradient across the groups. The interplay between proviral load and treatment response deserves further investigations. Resistance can develop against all the available antiretrovirals. The high turnover rate of HIV along with the error-prone reverse transcriptase leads to the possibility of steady accumulation of resistance mutations if the viremic suppression is incomplete. While the interplay between viremia and resistance development is clear-cut for some antiretrovirals i.e. Lamivudine, the pattern is more complex for i.e. Zidovudine. With the availability of assays for resistances testing the knowledge on this issue has been ever evolving. How to use resistance testing in the clinical monitoring of patients remains to be clarified. Resistance testing can aid in the process of choosing salvage therapy for patients experiencing virological failure. Whether resistance testing will be of clinical benefit in other situations remains to be determined. Investigation of the viral sequences and evolution herein has not only been used for resistance analyses, but also for tracing the spread of the infection. HIV-1 exists in many subtypes, with various geographic distributions. Hence subtype analyses have been used to investigate the introduction and spread of the HIV infection into many countries. Phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate nosocomial transmission events. We used analyses of env and gag sequences to trace a case of nosocomial infection at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study underlines the importance of steady awareness of the infection control precautions and possible breaks herein. The usefulness of this type of analyses was confirmed. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic various replicative patterns were described. Virus obtained from patients with late-stage infection often had virus that could induce syncytium formation (SI) when cultured, while virus obtained from patients in the early stages of infection did not have this ability. A correlation between the SI ability and the ability to yield high virus titres rapidly as well as the ability to establish infection in certain cell lines was found. Patients infected with SI virus experience more rapid clinical deterioration. We found that patients harbouring SI virus have HIV RNA loads no different from patients harbouring NSI virus. This is in line with the findings of other groups. Though patients harbouring SI virus had a more rapid development of resistance when treated with nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI's) monotherapy, this was not the case when treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAART is today considered the treatment modality of choice; both for established HIV-infection and in cases where post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is given in order to prevent establishment of infection after exposure. In a case of transfusion of HIV-contaminated though HIV antibody negative blood the recipient was treated with HAART. As the risk of infection is close to 100% under these circumstances the fact that the recipient remained uninfected is probably attributable to the prompt initiation and thorough maintenance of PEP. PEP is recommended to health care workers after percutaneous HIV exposure as well as after sexual exposure. Even with NRTI monotherapy PEP has been shown to be efficacious. While the explanation for the dichotomy (SI vs. NSI) was for many years unresolved, it is now known that this is due to the requirements of the virus for different co-receptors for cell entry. SI virus uses mainly CXCR4 while NSI virus uses CCR5. Being heterozygous for a 32 basepair deletion in the gene encoding CCR5 leads to slower disease progression. We have shown that heterozygotes have lower HIV RNA levels in the early years of the infection, possibly explaining the clinical advantage of having the deletion. HIV replicates in activated cells, and there is an intriguing interplay between HIV replication and immune activation. HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of immunoglobulins. HIV induces polygonal immunoglobulin production. We found that patients experiencing good virological suppression of HAART had lower IgA levels than patients with less complete viral suppression. Whether IgA can be used as a marker for imminent viral break-through remains to be determined. The full understanding of the interplay between immune activation and HIV replication awaits further studies. The finding of increased viremia in conjunction with acute bacterial or viral infection led to concerns about the safety of vaccinating HIV-infected patients against influenza and pneumococcal infection. We found no difference in HIV RNA levels measured before and median 42 days after anti-pneumococcal vaccination. This is in line with many other studies showing either no or only transient increases in viremia. In conclusion, the knowledge on HIV virology has expanded tremendously. This has led to significant improvements in treatments in the Western World leading to declines in HIV morbidity and mortality. The ability to quantify viral load and to perform sequence analyses represent valuable tools both for understanding the pathogenic actions of the virus and for the clinical monitoring of HIV-infected patients. The optimal usage of these tools in the clinical setting, however, still remains to be defined. The progresses obtained have unfortunately been restricted to the Western World and the calamities of HIV is spreading and worsening in the Developing World. The progress in the development of a vaccine has been disappointing and it is urgently necessary that the progresses obtained within the fields of prevention and treatment are translated into useful strategies in the parts of the world mostly affected by the HIV pandemic."
6125,0.01,6.0000,"Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event."
5542,0.01,6.0000,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dubé et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
6919,0.01,6.0000,"This consensus document has been prepared by a panel consisting of members of the AIDS Study Group (Gesida) and the Spanish Secretariat for the National Plan on AIDS (SPNS) after reviewing the efficacy and safety results of clinical trials, cohort and pharmacokinetic studies published in medical journals, or presented in medical scientific meetings. Gesida has prepared an objective and structured method to prioritise combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) in naïve patients. Recommendations strength (A, B, C) and the evidence which supports them (I, II, III) are based on a modification of the Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria. The current antiretroviral treatment (ART) of choice for chronic HIV infection is the combination of three drugs. ART is recommended in patients with symptomatic HIV infection, in pregnancy, in serodiscordant couples with high transmission risk, hepatitis B fulfilling treatment criteria, and HIV nephropathy. Guidelines on ART treatment in patients with concurrent diagnosis of HIV infection and an opportunistic type C infection are included. In asymptomatic patients ART is recommended on the basis of CD4 lymphocyte counts, plasma viral load and patient co-morbidities, as follows: 1) therapy should be started in patients with CD4 counts <350 cells/μL; 2) when CD4 counts are between 350 and 500 cells/μL, therapy will be recommended and only delayed if patient is reluctant to take it, the CD4 are stabilised, and the plasma viral load is low; 3) therapy could be deferred when CD4 counts are above 500 cells/μL, but should be considered in cases of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis C, high cardiovascular risk, plasma viral load >10(5) copies/mL, proportion of CD4 cells <14%, and in people aged >55 years. ART should include 2 reverse transcriptase inhibitors nucleoside analogues and a third drug (non-analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor or integrase inhibitor). The panel has consensually selected and given priority to using the Gesida score for some drug combinations, some of them co-formulated. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable viral load. Adherence to therapy plays an essential role in maintaining antiviral response. Therapeutic options are limited after ART failures, but an undetectable viral load may be possible nowadays. Adverse events are a fading problem of ART. Guidelines in acute HIV infection, in women, in pregnancy, and to prevent mother-to-child transmission and pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis are commented upon. Management of hepatitis B or C co-infection, other co-morbidities, and the characteristics of ART in HIV-2 infection are included."
7071,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite concern over EFV tolerability in clinical trials and practice, particularly related to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, some observational studies have shown high rates of EFV continuation at one year and low rates of CNS-related EFV substitution. The objective of this study was to further examine the real-world rate of CNS-related EFV discontinuation in antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-1 patients. This retrospective cohort study used a nationally representative electronic medical records database to identify HIV-1 patients ≥12 years old, treated with a 1st-line EFV-based regimen (single or combination antiretroviral tablet) from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2013. Patients without prior record of EFV use during 6-month baseline (i.e., antiretroviral therapy naïve) were followed 12 months post-medication initiation. CNS-related EFV discontinuation was defined as evidence of a switch to a replacement antiretroviral coupled with record of a CNS symptom within 30 days prior, absent lab evidence of virologic failure. We identified 1742 1st-line EFV patients. Mean age was 48 years, 22.7% were female, and 8.1% had a prior report of CNS symptoms. The first year, overall discontinuation rate among new users of EFV was 16.2%. Ten percent of patients (n = 174) reported a CNS symptom and 1.1% (n = 19) discontinued EFV due to CNS symptoms: insomnia (n = 12), headache (n = 5), impaired concentration (n = 1), and somnolence (n = 1). The frequency of CNS symptoms was similar for patients who discontinued EFV compared to those who did not (10.3 vs. 9.9%; P = .86). Our study found that EFV discontinuation due to CNS symptoms was low, consistent with prior reports."
5894,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."
4726,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"The number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is gradually increasing in Japan, and the morbidity rate from tuberculosis in the Japanese people is high. Accordingly, the number of cases with both infections is considered to increase in the future. Our hospital has already encountered 31 cases of HIV associated tuberculosis. HIV infects mainly CD4-positive cells. The extreme decrease in the cell count results in serious cellular immunological disorder. CD4-positive cell disorder induces disorders of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophage functions. These destructive conditions show the state of immunodeficiency including macrophage that are most important for defense of acid-fast bacterial infection. Migration and activation of macrophages with cytokines derived from T cells are impaired to induce the following phenomena: hypoplasia of granuloma, failure of tubercule bacillus suppression, the spread to regional lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes), and hematogenous dissemination. On this occasion, caseous necrosis and cavitation are unlikely to occur, and false-negative tuberculin reaction is often observed. The incidence of severe cases, which include miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, etc., and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, are high among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated tuberculosis cases. HIV-infected tuberculosis cases are generally regarded as endogenous exacerbation, but they include primary infection and reinfection as well. Even during the treatment for drug-sensitive strains particularly, some cases may have reinfection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, suggesting that caution should be taken against this point. Conversely, the association of tuberculosis is a factor for the poor prognosis of HIV infection, since it facilitates the development of HIV infection. If the bacteria belong to a drug-sensitive strain, the infection with them responds well to antituberculous drugs, the same as in tuberculosis cases without HIV infection, showing a favorable prognosis. However, the mortality rate of infection with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely high. The combined use of a protease inhibitor, i.e., anti-HIV drug, with rifampicin is regarded as contraindication for the treatment because rifampicin strongly induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 and increases the metabolism of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptases to markedly decrease the blood concentrations. Accordingly, the treatment for tuberculosis should take priority over that for HIV infection in HIV-infected tuberculosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be administered after the treatment of tuberculosis. When HAART is necessary for the treatment during the tuberculosis treatment, rifampicin had better be exchanged to rifabutin because the effect of rifabutin to induce cytochrome P-450 is less potent than that of rifampicin. A report has recently shown that the exacerbation of pyrexia and chest X-ray findings was transiently observed approximately 2 weeks after potent anti-HIV therapy for HIV-infected tuberculosis, which included a protease inhibitor. The reason for the exacerbation has been believed to be that the impaired function of CD4-positive cells is improved by the administration of anti-HIV drugs to raise temporarily the reaction of the vital part to M. tuberculosis. A tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction size of > or = 5 mm of induration is considered positive (i.e., indicative of M. tuberculosis infection) in persons who are infected with HIV. Persons with a TST reaction size > or = 5 mm who have not previously received treatment for M. tuberculosis infection should receive tuberculosis preventive treatment. Prevention by BCG vaccination is regarded as contraindications for HIV-infected patients, because disseminated M. bovis infection may be associated with them. Many HIV-positive patients infected with tuberculosis show uneventful healing, when M. tuberculosis is the sensitive strain. However, since some patients show the rapid course of tuberculosis, clinical physicians keep the early detection of tuberculosis for HIV-infected patients and the association of HIV infection for tuberculosis patients in their mind, respectively."
7099,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Although in Western Europe and North America the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined in patients awaiting renal transplantation, it remains a relevant clinical problem, mainly in patients with a long history of renal replacement therapy (RRT) who may have been infected many years ago. At the same time, a significant proportion of renal transplant recipients (RTR) is at risk for HBV infection in areas with endemic HBV. HBV infection may increase morbidity and mortality in RTR. The majority of long-term studies reported reduced patient survival compared with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative RTR. The risk for morbidity and mortality of HBsAg-positive RTR transplantation is probably related to the extent of pretransplant liver disease. A thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy in many patients, is required to assess the individual HBsAg-positive patient's risk-benefit ratio. The influence of immunosuppressive therapy on HBV replication and HBV-associated complications is not well established and for clinical practice individually tailored immunosuppression is recommended in HBsAg-positive RTR. Careful screening for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RTR and a regular clinical follow-up after renal transplantation (RTX) including liver sonography is required for early detection of HBV-associated complications. With the availability of new antiviral drugs, new options for pre- and posttransplant therapy might improve the prognosis of RTR with chronic HBV infection."
7203,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."
7381,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Coinfection of blood-borne hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive individuals frequently occurs in inmate population and peculiar viral strains and patterns of virological markers may be observed.Plasma from 69 HIV-1-positive inmates was obtained from 7 clinical centers connected with correctional centers in different towns in Italy. HIV, HBV, and HCV markers were tested by commercial assays. Virus genotyping was carried out by sequencing the protease and reverse transcriptase-encoding region (PR-RT region) for HIV and a region encompassing the NS5B gene for HCV and subsequent phylogenetic analysis.Twelve over 14 HIV-subtyped inmates were infected with HIV-1 subtype B strains. The 2 non-B strains belonged to subtype G and CRF02_AG, in an Italian and a Gambian patient, respectively. Variants carrying the K103N and Y181C resistance mutations to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were found in 2 out of 9 patients naive for combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) (22.2%). Most HIV-positive patients (92.8%) showed evidence of past or present HBV and/or HCV infection. Prevalence of HBV and HCV was 81.2% for both viruses, whereas prevalence of HBV/HCV coinfection was 69.6%. A significantly higher presence of HCV infection was found in Italians [odds ratio (OR) 11.0; interval 1.7-80.9] and in drug users (OR 27.8; interval 4.9-186.0). HCV subtypes were determined in 42 HCV or HBV/HCV-coinfected individuals. HCV subtypes 1a, 3a, 4d, and 1b were found in 42.9%, 40.5%, 14.3%, and 2.4% of inmates, respectively. Low titers of HBV DNA in HBV DNA positive subjects precluded HBV subtyping.The high prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections in HIV-infected inmates, as well as the heterogeneity of HIV and HCV subtypes suggest the need to adopt systematic controls in prisons to monitor both the burden and the genetic forms of blood-borne viral infections, in order to apply targeted therapeutic interventions."
6847,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"Children and adolescents are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission occurs through perinatal exposures, injecting drug use, consensual and nonconsensual sex, needle-stick and sharp injuries, and possibly some unusual contacts. Youth engaging in high-risk sexual activities are especially endangered. Half of the estimated worldwide 5.3 million new HIV infections occur in adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24. Of 20 000 known new adult and adolescent cases in the United States, 25% involve 13- to 21-year-olds. More than 1.4 million children worldwide (aged 15 and younger) are believed to be infected, and >1640 new cases are diagnosed daily. Of the 432 000 people reported to be living with HIV or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, 5575 are children under 13. HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a form of secondary HIV prevention that may reduce the incidence of HIV infections. HIV PEP is commonly conceived of as 2 types: occupational and nonoccupational. Occupational HIV PEP is an accepted form of therapy for health care workers exposed to HIV through their jobs. A landmark study of healthcare workers concluded that occupational HIV PEP may be efficacious. Well-established US national guidelines for occupational HIV PEP exist for this at-risk population. Nonoccupational HIV PEP includes all other forms of HIV PEP, such as that given after sexual assault and consensual sex, injecting drug use, and needle-stick and sharp injuries in non-health care persons. Pediatric HIV PEP is typically the nonoccupational type. The efficacy of nonoccupational HIV PEP is unknown. The presumed efficacy is based on a collection of animal and human data concerning occupational, perinatal, and nonoccupational exposures to HIV. In contrast to occupational HIV PEP, there are no national US guidelines for nonoccupational HIV PEP, and few recommendations are available for its use for adolescents and children. Regardless of this absence, there is encouraging evidence supporting the value of HIV PEP in its various forms in pediatrics. Although unproven, the presumed mechanism for HIV PEP comes from animal and human work suggesting that shortly after an exposure to HIV, a window period exists during which the viral load is small enough to be controlled by the body's immune system. Antiretroviral medications given during this period may help to diminish or end viral replication, thereby reducing the viral inoculum to a more potentially manageable target for the host's defenses. HIV PEP is accepted practice in the perinatal setting and for health care workers with occupational injuries. The medical literature supports prescribing HIV PEP after community needle-stick and sharp injuries and after sexual assault from sources known or likely to be HIV-infected. HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between HIV sero-opposite partners has had growing use in the adult population, and can probably be utilized for children and adolescents. There is less documented experience and support for HIV PEP after consensual unprotected intercourse between partners of unknown HIV status, after prolonged or multiple episodes of sexual abuse from an assailant of unknown HIV status, after bites, and after the sharing of personal hygiene items or exposure to wounds of HIV-infected individuals. There are no formal guidelines for HIV PEP in adolescents and children. A few groups have commented on its provision in pediatrics, and some preliminary studies have been released. Our article provides a discussion of the data available on HIV transmission and HIV PEP in pediatrics. In our article, we propose an HIV PEP approach for adolescents and children. We recommend a stratified regimen, based on the work of Gerberding and Katz and other authors, that attempts to match seroconversion risk with an appropriate number of medications, while taking into account adverse side-effects and the amount of information that is typically available upon initial presentation. Twice daily regimens should be used when possible, and may improve compliance. HIV PEP should be administered within 1 hour of exposure. We strongly recommend that physicians trained in this form of therapy review the indications for HIV PEP within 72 hours of its provision. We advocate that due diligence in determining level of risk and appropriateness of drug selection be conducted as soon as possible after an exposure has occurred. When such information is not immediately available, we recommend the rapid treatment using the maximum level of care followed by careful investigation and reconsideration in follow-up or whenever possible. HIV PEP may be initiated provisionally after an exposure and then discontinued if the exposure source is confirmed to not be HIV-infected.

7661,0.008333333333333333,5.0000,"The availability of an increasing number of antiretroviral agents and the rapid evolution of new information have introduced substantial complexity into treatment regimens for persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation convened the Panel on Clinical Practices for the Treatment of HIV to develop guidelines for clinical management of HIV-infected adults and adolescents (CDC. Report of the NIH Panel To Define Principles of Therapy of HIV Infection and Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected adults and adolescents. MMWR. 1998;47[RR-5]:1-41). This report, which updates the 1998 guidelines, addresses 1) using testing for plasma HIV ribonucleic acid levels (i.e., viral load) and CD4+ T cell count; 2) using testing for antiretroviral drug resistance; 3) considerations for when to initiate therapy; 4) adherence to antiretroviral therapy; 5) considerations for therapy among patients with advanced disease; 6) therapy-related adverse events; 7) interruption of therapy; 8) considerations for changing therapy and available therapeutic options; 9) treatment for acute HIV infection; 10) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among adolescents; 11) considerations for antiretroviral therapy among pregnant women; and 12) concerns related to transmission of HIV to others. Antiretroviral regimens are complex, have serious side effects, pose difficulty with adherence, and carry serious potential consequences from the development of viral resistance because of nonadherence to the drug regimen or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents. Patient education and involvement in therapeutic decisions are critical. Treatment should usually be offered to all patients with symptoms ascribed to HIV infection. Recommendations for offering antiretroviral therapy among asymptomatic patients require analysis of real and potential risks and benefits. In general, treatment should be offered to persons who have <350 CD4+ T cells/mm3 or plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels of >55,000 copies/mL (by b-deoxyribonucleic acid [bDNA] or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] assays). The recommendation to treat asymptomatic patients should be based on the willingness and readiness of the person to begin therapy; the degree of existing immunodeficiency as determined by the CD4+ T cell count; the risk for disease progression as determined by the CD4+ T cell count and level of plasma HIV RNA; the potential benefits and risks of initiating therapy in an asymptomatic person; and the likelihood, after counseling and education, of adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen. Treatment goals should be maximal and durable suppression of viral load, restoration and preservation of immunologic function, improvement of quality of life, and reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Results of therapy are evaluated through plasma HIV RNA levels, which are expected to indicate a 1.0 log10 decrease at 2-8 weeks and no detectable virus (<50 copies/mL) at 4-6 months after treatment initiation. Failure of therapy at 4-6 months might be ascribed to nonadherence, inadequate potency of drugs or suboptimal levels of antiretroviral agents, viral resistance, and other factors that are poorly understood. Patients whose therapy fails in spite of a high level of adherence to the regimen should have their regimen changed; this change should be guided by a thorough drug treatment history and the results of drug-resistance testing. Because of limitations in the available alternative antiretroviral regimens that have documented efficacy, optimal changes in therapy might be difficult to achieve for patients in whom the preferred regimen has failed. These decisions are further confounded by problems with adherence, toxicity, and resistance. For certain patients, participating in a clinical trial with or without access to new drugs or using a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replicatioing a regimen that might not achieve complete suppression of viral replication might be preferable. Because concepts regarding HIV management are evolving rapidly, readers should check regularly for additional information and updates at the HIV/AIDS Treatment Information Service website ( http://www.hivatis.org )."

In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
9217,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."

Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5222,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."

The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of ARV treatment system in Georgia. Study included 1052 people living with HIV/AIDS in Georgia registered at Infectious Disease, AIDS and Clinical Immunology Research Center since 2004. To ensure universal access to ARV therapy all HIV/AIDS individuals included in the study were investigated by special algorithm, all identified patients requiring ARV therapy were offered treatment and monitored during therapy on treatment effectiveness and side effects. Detection of HIV antibodies was performed by ELISA with further confirmation by Western Blot Assay. HIV-1 RNA in plasma was measured by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. For determination of percentages and absolute count of T lymphocyte subpopulations single-platform immunophenotyping technique using the Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer was applied. For resistance testing TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit with the OpenGene DNA Sequencing System (Siemens) was used. Treatment was offered to 595 HIV/AIDS patients. 594 patients started treatment, 1 patient refused. Out of treated 594 HIV/AIDS patients 22 patients discontinued, 111 patients died and 461 patients are currently on ARV treatment. Out of treated patients 406 adults and 21 children are receiving first-line treatment, 31 adults and 2 children are on second-line treatment and 1 adult is receiving salvage regimen. Treatment failure was defined in 55 cases. Among them immunological failure was observed in 7 cases, clinical failure in 1 case and virologic failure in 47 cases. Prevalence of drug resistance among virologic failure cases accounted for 72% and inadequate adherence for 28% cases. Majority of death cases among ARV treated patients was due to non-AIDS related or incurable conditions, while deaths due to AIDS related conditions mainly were associated to the delayed referral of patients in already advanced stage of disease. It's worth to mention that highest number of death cases was due to liver failure in HIV/HCV and/or HBV co-infected patients."
7054,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."

OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."
5219,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
3377,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
990,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"Background/Aims HIV continues to be a major public health threat in the United States, and mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the universal effective use of antiretroviral therapy among all HIV-positive individuals (i.e. the ""test and treat"" approach) has the potential to control HIV. However, to accomplish this, all the steps that define the HIV care continuum must be achieved at high levels, including HIV testing and diagnosis, linkage to and retention in clinical care, antiretroviral medication initiation, and adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. The HPTN 065 (Test, Link-to-Care Plus Treat [TLC-Plus]) study was designed to determine the feasibility of the ""test and treat"" approach in the United States. Methods HPTN 065 was conducted in two intervention communities, Bronx, NY, and Washington, DC, along with four non-intervention communities, Chicago, IL; Houston, TX; Miami, FL; and Philadelphia, PA. The study consisted of five components: (1) exploring the feasibility of expanded HIV testing via social mobilization and the universal offer of testing in hospital settings, (2) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase linkage to care, (3) evaluating the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase viral suppression, (4) evaluating the effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to decrease risk behavior in HIV-positive patients in healthcare settings, and (5) administering provider and patient surveys to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of antiretroviral therapy for prevention and the use of financial incentives to improve health outcomes. The study used observational cohorts, cluster and individual randomization, and made novel use of the existing national HIV surveillance data infrastructure. All components were developed with input from a community advisory board, and pragmatic methods were used to implement and assess the outcomes for each study component. Results A total of 76 sites in Washington, DC, and the Bronx, NY, participated in the study: 37 HIV test sites, including 16 hospitals, and 39 HIV care sites. Between September 2010 and December 2014, all study components were successfully implemented at these sites and resulted in valid outcomes. Our pragmatic approach to the study design, implementation, and the assessment of study outcomes allowed the study to be conducted within established programmatic structures and processes. In addition, it was successfully layered on the ongoing standard of care and existing data infrastructure without disrupting health services. Conclusion The HPTN 065 study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a multi-component ""test and treat"" trial that included a large number of community sites and involved pragmatic approaches to study implementation and evaluation."
2964,0.006666666666666667,4.0000,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
4320,0.005,3.0000,"Following global efforts to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) access in Sub-Saharan Africa, ART coverage among HIV-infected Cameroonians increased from 0% in 2003 to 22% in 2014. However, the success of current HIV treatment programs depends not only on access to ART, but also on retention in care and good treatment adherence. This is necessary to achieve viral suppression, prevent virologic failure, and reduce viral transmission and HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Previous studies in Cameroon showed poor adherence, treatment interruption, and loss to follow-up among HIV+ subjects on ART, but the factors that influence ART adherence are not well known. In the current cross-sectional study, patient/self-reported questionnaires and pharmacy medication refill data were used to quantify ART adherence and determine the factors associated with increased risk of non-adherence among HIV-infected Cameroonians. We demonstrated that drug side-effects, low CD4 cell counts and higher viral loads are associated with increased risk of non-adherence, and compared to females, males were more likely to forego ART because of side effects (p<0.05). Univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that subjects with opportunistic infections (on antibiotics) had 2.42-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.001). Multivariable analysis controlling for ART regimen, age, gender, and education showed that subjects with opportunistic infections had 3.1-times higher odds of having been non-adherent (p<0.0003), with significantly longer periods of non-adherence, compared to subjects without opportunistic infections (p = 0.02). We further showed that compared to younger subjects (≤40 years), older subjects (>40 years) were less likely to be non-adherent (p<0.01) and had shorter non-adherent periods (p<0.0001). The presence of depression symptoms correlated with non-adherence to ART during antibiotic treatment (r = 0.53, p = 0.04), and was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (p = 0.04) and longer non-adherent periods (p = 0.04). Change in ART regimen was significantly associated with increased likelihood of non-adherence and increased duration of the non-adherence period. Addressing these underlying risk factors could improve ART adherence, retention in care and treatment outcomes for HIV/AIDS patients in Cameroon."
57,0.005,3.0000,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."
5656,0.005,3.0000,"HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is of increasing public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa with the rollout of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. Such data are, however, limited in Kenya, where HIV-1 drug resistance testing is not routinely performed. From a population-based household survey conducted between September and November 2012 in rural western Kenya, we retrospectively assessed HIV-1 TDR baseline rates, its determinants, and genetic diversity among drug-naïve persons aged 15-59 years with acute HIV-1 infections (AHI) and recent HIV-1 infections (RHI) as determined by nucleic acid amplification test and both Limiting Antigen and BioRad avidity immunoassays, respectively. HIV-1 pol sequences were scored for drug resistance mutations using Stanford HIVdb and WHO 2009 mutation guidelines. HIV-1 subtyping was computed in MEGA6. Eighty seven (93.5%) of the eligible samples were successfully sequenced. Of these, 8 had at least one TDR mutation, resulting in a TDR prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI 4.7-17.1). No TDR was observed among persons with AHI (n = 7). TDR prevalence was 4.6% (95% CI 1.8-11.2) for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 6.9% (95% CI 3.2-14.2) for non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and 1.2% (95% CI 0.2-6.2) for protease inhibitors. Three (3.4% 95% CI 0.8-10.1) persons had dual-class NRTI/NNRTI resistance. Predominant TDR mutations in the reverse transcriptase included K103N/S (4.6%) and M184V (2.3%); only M46I/L (1.1%) occurred in the protease. All the eight persons were predicted to have different grades of resistance to the ARV regimens, ranging from potential low-level to high-level resistance. HIV-1 subtype distribution was heterogeneous: A (57.5%), C (6.9%), D (21.8%), G (2.3%), and circulating recombinant forms (11.5%). Only low CD4 count was associated with TDR (p = 0.0145). Our findings warrant the need for enhanced HIV-1 TDR monitoring in order to inform on population-based therapeutic guidelines and public health interventions."
6070,0.005,3.0000,"A clear understanding of the antiviral effects of CD8(+) T cells in the context of chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is critical for the development of prophylactic vaccines and therapeutics designed to support T-cell-mediated immunity. However, defining the potential correlates of effective CD8(+) T-cell immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the CD8(+) T-cell response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral load. Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of CD8(+) T-cell responses to autologous virus in a cohort of six HIV-infected individuals with a history of structured interruption of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (SIT). The magnitude and breadth of the HIV-specific response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the cessation of ART. Furthermore, mutational escape from targeted epitopes could not account for the differential virological outcomes in this cohort. However, the functionality of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations upon antigen encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five CD8(+) T-cell functions (degranulation and gamma interferon, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-2 levels) reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being elicited in those individuals with lower levels of viremia after SIT. These data show that the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response, rather than the quantity, is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of SIT can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells."

As of 2012, the SHR has the highest incidence rate of positive test reports for HIV in Canada, at more than three times the national average (17.0 vs. 5.9 per 100,000 people). Additionally, the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in the SHR is different from that seen elsewhere in Canada (still mostly men having sex with men and Caucasians), with its new HIV cases predominantly associated with injection drug use and Aboriginal cultural status. The purpose of this study was to (a) describe the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the STW in the SHR, (b) identify their significant life events, self-reported problems, knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, self-efficacy, and barriers regarding HIV, and (c) determine the significant independent risk indicators for STW self-reporting a chance of greater than 50% of becoming infected with HIV/AIDS. The majority of the study participants were females, who were never married, of Aboriginal descent, without a high school diploma, and had an annual income of less than $10,000. Using multivariate regression analysis, four significant independent risk indicators were associated with STW reporting a greater that 50% chance of acquiring HIV/AIDS, including experiencing sexual assault as a child, injecting drugs in the past four weeks, being homeless, and a previous Chlamydia diagnosis. These findings provide important evidence of the essential sexual and drug-related vulnerabilities associated with the risk of HIV infection among STW and offer insight into the design and implementation of effective and culturally sensitive public health intervention and prevention efforts. To be most effective, it is recommended that such intervention and prevention initiatives: (1) use specifically tailored community-based outreach to high risk STW who are drug users and link them with appropriate drug treatment and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services, (2) provide free and confidential, routine HIV counseling and testing in substance abuse programs, and (3) build capacity among the local, Aboriginal NGOs so as to address with cultural sensitivity both the drug and HIV-related risk factors prevalent among this vulnerable population."
5786,0.005,3.0000,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
206,0.005,3.0000,"The HIV lipodystrophy syndrome, a condition characterized by subcutaneous fat loss sometimes associated with relative or absolute accumulation of central fat, has a high prevalence in the treatment of HIV infection. Associated metabolic alterations include peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, increased free fatty acids, and decreased HDL. Often, these metabolic abnormalities appear or deteriorate before the manifestation of fat redistribution. Hypertriglyceridemia is the leading lipid abnormality after initiation of HIV therapy frequently observed together with low HDL cholesterol. Raised levels of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been found in these patients, and there are reports about hypertension associated with antiretroviral therapy. Thus, the lipodystrophy syndrome in HIV therapy resembles a clinical situation that is known as the ""metabolic syndrome"" in HIV-negative patients. There is now good evidence that the metabolic abnormalities of HIV-infected patients harbor a significant risk for cardiovascular disease with as yet unknown consequences. In addition, several studies report a reduced quality of life in patients with body habitus changes leading to reduced therapy adherence. Current data indicate a rather multifactorial pathogenesis where HIV infection, its therapy, and patient-related factors are major contributors. Therapeutic and preventive strategies have, so far, been of only limited or no success. For reduction of the cardiovascular risk, recommendations proposed for non-HIV-infected patients like the National Cholesterol Education Program (NECP) have been adapted for HIV-infected patients. These should be regarded as rather preliminary and need to be evaluated in further clinical trials. General recommendations include dietary changes and physical activity, switch of antiretroviral drugs (replacement of protease inhibitors), and, finally, use of metabolically active drugs. Lipid-lowering agents can be considered for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia, elevated LDL, or a combination of both. Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, however, share common hepatic metabolization pathways with protease inhibitors (cytochrome P450 3A4 system), thereby potentially leading to additional liver and muscle toxicity. Although clinicians should assess cardiovascular risk factors and target risk reduction in HIV-infected patients, the primary goal in HIV therapy remains to be the effective suppression of viral replication leading to reduced morbidity and mortality."
7248,0.005,3.0000,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
8574,0.005,3.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus infection affects approximately 10% of HIV-infected patients. There are an estimated 4 million patients with HIV/HBV coinfection. HIV infection has a deleterious effect on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and increases the risk of progression to cirrhosis and terminal liver disease. Since the widespread use of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), liver disease has emerged as one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive patients. Therefore, all patients with HIV/HBV coinfection should be evaluated for treatment of hepatitis B, independently of the CD4 lymphocyte count. Six drugs are currently authorized for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: standard interferon-alpha (2a and 2b), pegylated interferon alpha-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Other drugs with activity against HBV, such as tenofovir and emtricitabine, are used for the treatment of HIV infection. In patients not requiring HAART, treatment of hepatitis B should preferably consist of drugs without activity against HIV, such as pegylated interferon or adefovir. In contrast, in patients requiring HAART, a combination of drugs with activity against both viruses should be used, such as lamivudine, emtricitabine and tenofovir, with the aim of achieving maximal viral suppression and avoiding the development of resistance. Patients with HIV/HBV coinfection require periodic clinical and virological monitoring. Patients with cirrhosis should undergo ultrasonography and alphafetoprotein determination every 6 months for the early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma."
6505,0.005,3.0000,"Injection drug use (IDU) and HIV infection are important public health problems in Vietnam. The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."
4403,0.005,3.0000,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
9849,0.005,3.0000,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described. Serum transaminases were elevated. Serological assays showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies but no antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) antibodies. Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4038,0.005,3.0000,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV.

4645,0.005,3.0000,"Among many factors that can influence vulnerability to infection and disease progression are genetic host factors together with the phenotype/genotype of the transmitting virus and the route of infection. Each of these factors alone or in combination could determine susceptibility to infection and subsequent rate of progression towards AIDS. Between host genetic factors identified and analyzed for their role in HIV-1 transmission and disease progression are polymorphisms in the genes encoding chemokine receptors and CCR5, CCR2 and SDF-1 a natural ligand for CXCR4 receptor. It has been shown that the distribution of this genetic polymorphisms and their role in the course of disease varies between different racial, ethnic and risk groups. The aim of present study was to examine the frequencies of polymorphic alleles CCR5-delta32, CCR2-64I and SDF-1-3'A and their role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transmission in Polish population. The allelic and genotype distribution was studied in 103 HIV-1 infected patients (group HIV+) and 59 seronegative participants (group HIV-). Genotyping was done by the use of polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers and restriction fragment length polymorphism. We found higher prevalence of CCR5-delta32 mutant allele among seronegative participants (13.6%) compared with HIV-infected patients (9.7%), although this did not attain statistical significance (p = 0.29). The CCR2-64I allelic frequency was almost identical in the HIV- and HIV+ groups (12.7% vs. 12.6%; respectively; p = 0.98). In contrast, the SDF-1-3'A allelic frequency was slightly lower among seronegative participants (15.3%) compared with HIV-infected patients (16.5%), and observed difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.77). Furthermore, we found that the genotype or allelic frequencies among HIV-1 infected patients were independent on the participant's sex, age at HIV-1 infection and the transmission route. Our results showed no significant differences in the prevalence of examined alleles and genotypes between HIV-1 infected patients and seronegative participants, which indicates that in the examined population they are not influencing host susceptibility to the HIV-1 infection."
2343,0.005,3.0000,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in chronic hepatitis C patient. However, its significance and consequences are still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of occult HBV among HCV chronic carriers in France and to assess its impact on liver histology and response to antiviral therapy. To this end a cohort of 203 patients with chronic hepatitis C without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been examined. Serum HBV-DNA was detected using a highly sensitive PCR with primers located in the S and X genes. HBV viraemia levels were further determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that 47 of 203 (23%) patients had occult HBV infection with a low HBV load (10(2)-10(4) copies/ml) but significantly higher HCV-RNA titers (P < 0.05). No significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT level, HCV genotypes, and the presence of anti-HBc was observed between patients with or without HBV-DNA. When compared histologically, patients with occult HBV infection had higher activity (A2-A3 in 53% vs. 38%, P < 0.01) and more advanced fibrosis (60% vs. 33%, P < 0.001) than HBV-DNA negative cases. Sustained response to combination therapy against Chronic hepatitis C was achieved in 11 (28%) of 40 HBV-DNA positive cases, compared with 65 (45%) of the 144 HBV-DNA negative cases (P < 0.05). Among the 144 HBV-DNA negative HCV patients those with genotype 1 responded less frequently to therapy as compared to other genotypes infected patients (38% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, when considering all patients studied, irrespective to the HBV-DNA status no significant difference was observed in response to combination therapy regarding HCV genotypes (39% vs. 44%, P > 0.05). In conclusion, HBV-DNA is found in 1/4 of French chronic hepatitis C patients regardless of the presence of anti-HBc. Such an occult HBV co-infection is associated with more severe liver disease, higher HCV viral load and decreased response to antiviral therapy irrespective of HCV genotypes."
2272,0.005,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence is highly diverse among human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients, ranging between 10% of HIV-1 infected homo-bisexuel men, to >92% in patients infected with HIV-1 who acquired HIV-1 through intravenous drug use. Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
5566,0.005,3.0000,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
3771,0.005,3.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and the varied outcomes of the infection depend on both viral and host factors. We have demonstrated that the HCV alternate reading frame protein (F protein) is related to Th1/Th2 bias which is involved in virus persistence in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic variants of TBX21 (T cell specific T-box transcription factor) were associated with the outcomes of HCV infection and F protein generation. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs17250932, rs2074190, rs4794067) in the TBX21 gene were genotyped in a case-control study in a cohort of a high-risk group, including 354 healthy controls and 747 CHC patients (190 anti-F protein antibody seronegative patients and 557 anti-F protein antibody seropositive patients). Results showed that the rs4794067 C allele in the TBX21 promoter was significantly more common in CHC patients (OR = 1.335, 95% CI = 1.058-1.684, P = 0.015), exceptionally in anti-F protein seropositive patients (OR = 1.547, 95% CI = 1.140-2.101, P = 0.005), compared with healthy controls. And the risk effect was also significantly high in patients with HCV 1b genotype and mild fibrosis (P = 0.021, P = 0.010, respectively). Compared with the most frequent haplotype TAT, haplotype analysis showed that the distribution of TAC was significantly different between the chronic HCV carrier group and the healthy group, and so was the anti-F antibody seronegativity group and the anti-F antibody seronegativity group (all P < 0.001). Our results suggested that TBX21 variants may be involved in the etiology of this disease."
5459,0.005,3.0000,"In order to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in french patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on maintenance dialysis therapy, questionnaire forms were mailed out in february 1997 to the heads of the 260 dialysis facilities. We documented number of patients on maintenance dialysis therapy (hemo and peritoneal dialysis) and for HIV infected dialysis patients: age, gender, cause and duration of ESRD, known duration of HIV infection, risk factors for HIV infection, HBV and/or HCV infection, presence of clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), total CD4 count and treatment with antiretroviral agents. Questionnaire forms were returned from 98% of the dialysis facilities. As of february 1997 some 22,707 patients with ESRD were treated by renal replacement therapy, 19,947 by hemodialysis (HD) and 2760 by peritoneal dialysis (PD). 82 patients with ESRD and HIV infection were reported corresponding to 0.36% prevalence rate of all patients undergoing dialysis at the time specified. The 82 study subjects with ESRD and HIV infection received hemodialysis (79 patients) or peritoneal dialysis (3 patients) in 42 facilities. Forty seven patients were treated in Paris and suburbs and 9 in our own center. All 82 patients comprised 63% men and 47% women which included patients coming from Africa (37%), Caribbean and Oceania (28%), Europe (35%) of a mean age of 41.8 years. Modes of transmission were homobisexuals 15%, heterosexuals 31%, intravenous drug abusers 17%, blood transfusion 17% and unknown 20%. The mean duration of HIV infection was 96 months (range 12-168 months) and the mean duration of ESRD was 58 months (range 1-235 months). HIV associated nephropathy was established in 31%. AIDS was diagnosed in 25 patients. Seventy one percent of the patients were receiving an antiretroviral drug (tritherapy in 25% of cases). In conclusion HIV prevalence rate among French dialysis patients is low and focused in Paris and oversea. Sexual transmission is the most important HIV contamination but blood transfusion transmission remains greater than in general HIV population. Survival has improved compared with the survival rate reported in the 1980s."
2193,0.005,3.0000,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."
4606,0.005,3.0000,"Worldwide viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice, chronic liver disease cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. While important advances have been made in prevention of viral hepatitis, therapy of this disease remains unsatisfactory. There are no specific therapies of proven benefit for acute hepatitis, although use of alpha-interferon during the acute phase of hepatitis C may result in a decrease in the rate of chronicity. For chronic viral hepatitis, alpha-interferon has been widely used, but is expensive, poorly tolerated and limited in effectiveness. New antiviral agents and use of combinations of antivirals are now being evaluated and promise to provide a therapy that is effective in the majority of patients. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis B is a 4- to 6-month course of alpha-interferon in doses of 5-10 million units three times a week; a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from serum in approximately one-third and a loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in one-tenth of patients. Long-term follow-up of patients who respond to interferon treatment with clearance of HBeAg indicate that the majority ultimately clear HBsAg as well and have continued remission in the liver disease, although low levels of HBV DNA can commonly be detected in liver tissue. Better therapies of hepatitis B are needed. Recently, several oral 'second-generation' nucleoside analogues have been developed that have potent activity against HBV. The best studied is lamivudine (3-thiacytidine) which results in marked inhibition of HBV DNA levels and improvement in serum aminotransferases and hepatic histology in the majority of patients. When stopped, however, most patients relapse and the shortcomings of long-term therapy have been the development of viral resistance in up to one-quarter of patients within a year and a higher percentage with more prolonged therapy. Future approaches of therapy of promise for hepatitis B are combinations of lamivudine with interferon and other antiviral nucleoside analogues. The currently recommended therapy of chronic hepatitis C is a 12- to 18-month course of alpha interferon in doses of 3 million units three times a week: a regimen that results in sustained clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in approximately 20% of patients. Sustained responses have been associated with marked improvements in hepatic histology and long-term studies indicate that the majority of patients remain free of virus in serum and liver, suggesting a 'cure' of infection. Responses to interferon correlate to some degree with clinical and virological features, including young age, absence of hepatic fibrosis, low levels of HCV RNA in serum and HCV genotypes 2 and 3.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."
1917,0.005,3.0000,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
7834,0.005,3.0000,"As many as 2.2 million persons in the United States are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (1), and approximately 15%-25% of persons with chronic HBV infection will die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer (2). Since 2006, the overall U.S. incidence of acute HBV infection has remained stable; the rate in 2013 was 1.0 case per 100,000 persons (3). Hepatitis B vaccination is highly effective in preventing HBV infection and is recommended for all infants (beginning at birth), all adolescents, and adults at risk for HBV infection (e.g., persons who inject drugs, men who have sexual contact with men, persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], and others). Hepatitis B vaccination coverage is low among adults: 2013 National Health Interview Survey data indicated that coverage with ≥3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine was 32.6% for adults aged 19-49 years (4). Injection drug use is a risk factor for both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HBV. Among young adults in some rural U.S. communities, an increased incidence of HCV infection has been associated with a concurrent increase of injection drug use (5); and recent data indicate an increase of acute HCV infection in the Appalachian region associated with injection drug use (6). Using data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) during 2006-2013, CDC assessed the incidence of acute HBV infection in three of the four Appalachian states (Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia) included in the HCV infection study (6). Similar to the increase of HCV infections recently reported, an increase in incident cases of acute HBV infection in these three states has occurred among non-Hispanic whites (whites) aged 30-39 years who reported injection drug use as a common risk factor. Since 2009, cases of acute HBV infection have been reported from more non-urban than urban regions. Evidence-based services to prevent HBV infection are needed. "
325,0.005,3.0000,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
5370,0.005,3.0000,"Evaluation of drug resistance by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotyping has proven to be useful for the selection of drug combinations with maximum antiretroviral activity. We compared three genotyping methods for identification of mutations known to confer drug resistance in the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The HIV-GenotypR method (GenotypR; Specialty Laboratories, Inc., Santa Monica, Calif.) with the ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.), the HIV PRT GeneChip assay (GeneChip; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif.), and the HIV-1 RT Line Probe Assay (LiPA; Innogenetics, Alpharetta, Ga.) were used to genotype plasma samples from HIV-infected patients attending the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics and the Mayo Clinic. At the time of analysis, patients were failing combination therapy (n = 18) or were treatment naive (n = 6). Forty codons of the RT and protease genes were analyzed by GenotypR and GeneChip for resistance-associated mutations. LiPA analyzed seven RT codons for mutations. Each sample was genotyped by all three assays, and each assay was subjected to pairwise comparisons. At least 92% of the codons tested (by the three assays) in paired comparisons were concordant. GenotypR and GeneChip demonstrated 96.6% concordance over the 40 codons tested. GenotypR identified slightly more mutations than GeneChip and LiPA; GeneChip identified all primary mutations that corresponded to failing treatment regimens. Each assay identified at least 84% of the mutations identified by the other assays. Mutations that were discordant between the assays mainly comprised secondary mutations and natural polymorphisms. The assays had better concordance for mutations that corresponded to current failing regimens, present in the more predominant viral quasispecies. In the treatment-naive patients, GenotypR, GeneChip, and LiPA mainly identified wild-type virus. Only the LiPA identified K70R, a possible transmitted zidovudine resistance mutation, in the RT gene of a treatment-naive patient. We conclude that although discrepancies in results exist between assays, each assay showed a similar capacity to identify potentially clinically relevant mutations related to patient treatment regimens."
3284,0.005,3.0000,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
5254,0.005,3.0000,"The mechanisms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of a man (VH) homozygous for the CCR5Delta32 mutation were investigated, and coreceptors other than CCR5 used by HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolated from this individual were identified. In contrast to previous reports, this individual's rate of disease progression was not accelerated. Homozygosity for CCR5Delta32 mutation was demonstrated by PCR and DNA sequencing (R. Biti et al., Nat. Med. 3:252-253, 1997). CCR5 surface expression was absent on T lymphocytes and macrophages. HIV was isolated by coculture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from siblings who were homozygous (VM) or wild type (WT) for the CCR5Delta32 mutation. The virus demonstrated dual tropism for infection of MT2 cell line and primary macrophages. Sequencing of the full HIV genome directly from the patient's PBMCs revealed 21 nucleotide insertions in the V1 region of gp120. The VH envelope sequence segregated apart from both the T-cell-line-adapted tropic strains NL4-3 and SF2 and M-tropic strain JRFL or YU2 by phylogenetic tree analysis. VH was shown to utilize predominantly CXCR4 for entry into T lymphocytes and macrophages by HOS.CD4 cell infection assay, direct envelope protein fusion, and inhibition by anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (12G5), SDF-1, and AMD3100. Microsatellite mapping demonstrated the separate inheritance of CXCR4 by both homozygote brothers (VH and VM). Our study demonstrates the ability of certain strains of HIV to readily use CXCR4 for infection or entry into macrophages, which is highly relevant to the pathogenesis of late-stage disease and presumably also HIV transmission."
2034,0.005,3.0000,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."
7803,0.005,3.0000,"Throughout most of the past century, physicians could offer patients no treatments for infections caused by viruses. The experience with treatment of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has changed the way healthcare workers deal with viral infections and has triggered a growing rate of discovery and use of antiviral agents, the first fruits of the expanding genomics revolution. HIV treatment also provides an informative paradigm for pharmacogenomics because control of infection and its consequences is limited by the development of viral drug resistance and by host factors. This report summarizes studies published to date on the significance of testing of HIV-1 resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved kit is commercially available through Visible Genetics, Inc., for HIV drug resistance testing by genotypic sequencing. Genotyping sequencing alone is most likely an adequate test to assist in the therapeutic decision-making process in cases of previous regimen failure, treatment-naïve patients in areas of high prevalence of transmitted resistant virus, and pregnant women. However, in exceptional cases of highly complex mutation patterns and extensive cross-resistance, it may be useful to obtain a phenotype test, because that result may more easily identify drugs to which the virus is least resistant. There are no published clinical trial results on the usefulness of the so-called virtual phenotype over genotypic sequencing alone. The paradigm of viral pharmacogenomics in the form of HIV genotypic sequencing has been not only useful to the treatment of other viral diseases but also important to the real-life implementation of the growing discipline of genomics or molecular medicine. The application of this paradigm to the thousands of potential therapeutic targets that have become available through the various human genome projects will certainly gradually change the landscape of diagnosis and management of many diseases, including cancer."
5179,0.005,3.0000,"We examined the prevalence and prognostic value of early responses to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) among community-based injection drug users (IDUs) in Baltimore. Virologic (HIV RNA <1000 copies/ml) and immunologic (CD4 >500 cells/ul or increase of 50 cells/ul from the pre-HAART level) responses were examined in the 1st year of HAART initiation. Cox regression was used to examine the effect of early response on progression to new AIDS diagnosis or AIDS-related death. Among 258 HAART initiators, 75(29%) had no response, 53(21%) had a virologic response only, 38(15%) had an immunologic response only and 92(36%) had a combined immunologic and virologic response in the first year of therapy. Poorer responses were observed in those who were older, had been recently incarcerated, reported injecting drugs, had not had a recent outpatient visit and had some treatment interruption within the 1st year of HAART. In multiple Cox regression analysis, the risk of progression was lower in those with combined virologic and immunologic response than in non-responders, (relative hazard [RH], 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.60). Those with discordant responses had reduced risk of progression compared to non-responders but experienced faster progression than those with a combined response, although none of these differences was statistically significant. Early discordant and non response to HAART was common, often occurred in the setting of injection drug use and treatment interruption and was associated with poorer survival. Interventions to reduce treatment interruptions and to provide continuity of HIV care during incarceration among IDUs are needed to improve responses and subsequent survival."
5450,0.005,3.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "
7755,0.005,3.0000,"Mortality in HIV-positive persons is increasingly due to non-HIV-related medical comorbidities. There are limited data on the prevalence and patient awareness of these comorbid conditions. Two hundred subjects at an urban HIV clinic were interviewed in 2005 to assess their awareness of 15 non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, defined as medical problems that are neither AIDS-defining by standard definitions, nor a direct effect of immune deficiency. Medical charts were subsequently reviewed to establish prevalence and concordance between self-report and chart documentation. Eighty-four percent of subjects self-reported at least 1 of 15 medical comorbidities and 92% had at least 1 condition chart-documented. The top 5 chart-documented conditions were hepatitis C (51.5%), pulmonary disease (28.5%), high blood pressure (27%), high cholesterol (24.5%), and obesity (22.5%). In multivariate analysis, higher number of non-HIV-related medical comorbidities was associated with older age, female gender, and intravenous drug use as route of HIV transmission. Across self-reported non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, the absolute concordance rate ranged from 67% to 96%, the sensitivity ranged from 0% to 79%; the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100%. While the vast majority of largely urban minority HIV-positive subjects were diagnosed with non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, there is significant room for improvement in patient awareness. In order to help patients optimally access and adhere to medication and medical care for these non-HIV-related medical comorbidities, interventions and educational campaigns to improve patient awareness that take cultural background, literacy, and educational level into account should be developed, implemented, and evaluated."

The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
6569,0.005,3.0000,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is predominantly a hepatotropic virus but also infects cells of the lymphatic system. HBV genomes (DNA, messenger (m)RNA, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA) and proteins have been found in extrahepatic sites such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid. HBV entry into hepatocytes occurs by binding of the HBV preS1 surface protein to its specific receptor, the bile acid transporter, sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP). Although the mechanism of HBV entry into lymphatic cells is unknown, the pre S1 encoded surface protein is thought to be involved. Extrahepatic HBV infection has been studied in both chronic HBV (CHB) and in occult HBV infection (OBI). Studies have shown that HBV genomes are present in different PBMC subsets from chronically infected carriers. Unique HBV variants have been found in PBMC compared to plasma or liver in both nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) treated and untreated CHB carriers, suggesting replication and compartment specific evolution of HBV. In HBV coinfection, HBV genomes were found in PBMC from hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) co-infected individuals. Moreover, during pregnancy, the trans placental passage of HBV infected PBMC from highly viremic mothers to infants is one of the postulated means of vertical transmission of HBV. Taken together, HBV infection in extrahepatic sites (i.e., PBMC) is implicated in multiple facets of HBV pathogenesis such as persistence, viral evolution and vertical transmission."

Here, we performed a cross-sectional analysis using 399 patients within the Aquitaine cohort (a hospital-based cohort of HIV-1-infected patients receiving routine clinical management) to estimate the prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction (PRTD) associated with HIV infection. These patients did not differ statistically by sociodemographics, median age, years since HIV diagnosis, AIDS stage, or median CD4 cell count from the entire 3080 patient cohort. Antiretroviral therapy was received by 352 patients, with 256 given tenofovir (TDF); 325 had undetectable HIV plasma viral load, and 26 were diagnosed with PRTD. In multivariate analysis, significant independent associations were found between PRTD and age (odds ratio (OR) 1.28 per 5-year increase), atazanavir (OR 1.28 per year of exposure), and TDF (OR 1.23 per year) treatment. Among patients having received TDF-containing regimens over a 5-year period, PRTD remained significantly associated with TDF exposure when treatment was ongoing (OR 5.22) or had been discontinued (OR 11.49). Thus, cumulative exposure to TDF and/or atazanavir was associated with an increased risk of PRTD, with concern about its reversibility in patients with HIV."

Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."

However, reliance on results of a single test can result in an underestimation of antiretroviral drug resistance. In the present study, we quantified the prevalence of resistance-associated mutations found in recent genotypic tests of 1734 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced subjects who had at least 3 genotypic tests (n = 11,404 genotypic tests total; median, 5 tests/subject) and compared it with that of resistance-associated mutations ever detected in these subjects between 1996 and 2004. Single-point analyses underestimated antiretroviral drug resistance, particularly for nucleoside analogues, in both individuals and patient populations. For example, the prevalence of resistance-associated mutation M184V/I was 25.5% in the most recent genotypes and 58.8% in available historical genotypes. Our results suggest that analysis of a combined historical genotype rather than of a cross-sectional genotype may lead to more accurate estimates of antiretroviral drug resistance in individual patients and in patient populations."

The extent to which these additional cellular reservoirs contribute to ongoing immunodeficiency and viral persistence during therapy remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a detailed investigation of HIV-1 diversity and genetic structure in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and monocytes of 13 patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Analysis of molecular variance and nonparametric tests performed on HIV-1 envelope sequences provided statistically significant evidence of viral compartmentalization in different leukocyte populations. Signature pattern analysis and predictions of coreceptor use provided no evidence that selection arising from viral tropism was responsible for the genetic structure observed. Analysis of viral genetic variation in different leukocyte populations demonstrated the action of founder effects as well as significant variation in the extent of genetic differentiation between subpopulations among patients. In the absence of evidence for leukocyte-specific selection, these features were supportive of a metapopulation model of HIV-1 replication as described previously among HIV-1 populations in the spleen. Compartmentalization of the virus in different leukocytes may have significant implications for current models of HIV-1 population genetics and contribute to the highly variable way in which drug resistance evolves in different individuals during HAART."

This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65 years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P < 0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ages below 30 years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30 years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."

The prevalence of hepatitis A varies greatly in different Brazilian regions, from 56% in South and Southeast to 93% in North region (Manaus, Amazon). Such differences are also found in different socioeconomic levels among age groups. A significantly higher prevalence was seen in the low socioeconomic group between 1-30 years. This difference is most striking in the first 10 years of age (23.5% vs 60.0%, high/middle vs low, respectively). Despite the improvements in sanitary conditions, hepatitis A is still endemic and outbreaks may occur. As an increasing proportion of the population is becoming susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection and as adult individuals may present more severe forms of the disease, the authors conclude that the implement of hepatitis A vaccination should be considered. Some Brazilian data have shown that the genotype found in our country were IA and IB. Isolates from this study were closely related genetically (or even identical) to isolates originating in other South American countries and overseas, providing firm evidence for epidemiological links between persons who travel to endemic areas. In spite of favorable environmental conditions, outbreaks of hepatitis E have never been reported in Brazil. Nevertheless, reports have demonstrated the evidence of anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies in some Brazilian regions. The seroprevalence of IgG anti-hepatitis E virus among normal populations shows positivities of 6.1% in gold-miners, 3.3% in general population, 2.0-7.5% in blood donors, 1.0% in pregnant women, and 4.5% in children, with no differences among regions. In populations at risk the prevalence of anti-hepatits E virus varies greatly.

Even more important, 5-10% of patients infected with HBV become chronic carries and about 25% of these will die due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The reservoir of HBV chronic carriers in the world is estimated at more than 200 million people and 80% of them reside in Asia and the western Pacific. In high-incidence areas, such as south-east Asia, perinatal transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns appears to be the most important factor for the high prevalence of HBV infection and 70-90% of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers become chronic carriers. Three possibilities of transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns are suggested: (a) transplacental transmission in utero - it was estimated that such transmission occurred in 5-15% of newborns; (b) transmission during delivery, which is considered the main mode of perinatal transmission; (c) postnatal transmission from mother to newborn, which is not common. HBeAg is the main maternal factor in determining whether infection of newborns will occur; the expression of this antigen seems to be determined genetically. Recently it has shown that immunoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing the development of the carrier state in infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers. Only 5-10% of high-risk infants are not protected by vaccination. If it becomes possible to immunize the entire world population including all babies born to carrier mothers at birth, and if our knowledge of the mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HBV is accurate, the carriers and acute cases of HB ought to disappear in two to three generations."
4229,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Reactivation of hepatitis B is characterized by a sudden increase in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in a patient with prior evidence of resolved or inactive HBV infection. Although HBV reactivation can occur spontaneously, it usually occurs after chemotherapy, immunosuppression (organ transplantation) or an alteration in immune function (therapy for autoimmune disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection). The clinical presentation cases can vary, ranging from a subclinical, asymptomatic course to severe acute hepatitis and even death. Although reactivation of HBV is mainly found in HBsAg-positive patients, it can be observed in serologically recovered anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBc)-positive, HBsAg-negative patients. Serum HBV DNA typically increases during immune suppression, followed by a disease flare and HBV DNA clearance following immune restoration after immune suppression is stopped. In organ transplant recipients, without immune reconstitution, high HBV DNA levels can lead to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis related to the direct cytopathic effect of HBV. Several randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown that reactivation can be prevented by lamivudine prophylaxis. Screening for HBsAg and anti-HBc should be performed before beginning immunosuppressive treatment and routine prophylaxis is recommended in HBsAg-positive patients. The optimal duration of prophylaxis remains to be determined. In anti-HBc-positive patients with or without anti-hepatitis B surface antigen, alanine transaminase and HBV DNA levels should be closely monitored and antiviral therapy should be started when HBV reactivation is confirmed. The use of new more potent nucleos(t)ides analogues with lower resistance rates would seem to be logical; however, experience with these drugs in the prophylaxis and treatment of severe HBV reactivation is limited."
4909,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) is common and can lead to serious consequences including liver cirrhosis, failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The hepatitis B virus (HBV) has a simple genome, but a complex lifecycle that includes the production of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Currently approved antiviral treatments for CHB include interferon (IFN) and nucleos(t)ide analogues. These drugs work either by stimulating the immune system to eliminate virus-infected cells or to inhibit viral replication, respectively. The drugs do not affect the cccDNA pool in the nucleus; therefore, this molecule represents a persistent source of recurrent infection that is difficult to eradicate. With longer-term follow-up of patients treated with antiviral therapy, investigators have looked at whether treatment can prevent the development of HCC. Unfortunately, the data are fairly heterogeneous in terms of both quality and conclusions. IFN appears to reduce the risk of HCC, but the benefit seems to be restricted to cirrhotic patients who have a lasting response to therapy. Oral agents successfully suppress HBV DNA replication and slow or even reverse hepatic fibrosis. Studies suggest that long-term therapy reduces the risk of HCC in patients with active disease and again primarily in those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. The mechanism by which any of the therapies reduce the risk of HCC is not clear. The authors review the lifecycle of HBV and mechanisms by which the virus may be carcinogenic followed by a review of the literature on the efficacy of therapy in reducing the risk of HCC."

The number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and AIDS in the United States continues to increase, estimated at more than 370,000 in 1998, and there is good reason for optimism that HIV infection may be a controllable disease in many people. Nevertheless, an estimated 27,000 persons still died of AIDS in the United States in 1997, and AIDS is still a leading cause of death in the age group 25 to 44 years. Despite the dramatic treatment advances for HIV infection and improving survival following an AIDS diagnosis, many patients still present with life-threatening complications of HIV infection for three major reasons. Highly active antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and other infections are not effective in all patients, despite rigorous adherence to treatment. Others adhere to these therapies poorly. Finally, many patients present with advanced disease, unaware that they have HIV infection until they develop a serious opportunistic infection. Therefore, the AIDS epidemic and its burden of illness will continue, and decisions regarding the appropriateness of intensive care for individual patients will be inevitable. The impact of AIDS in Africa and Asia is far more devastating than in the United States and Europe, and most HIV-infected persons in the world live in the underdeveloped nations where intensive care is often unavailable. This article will deal with intensive care in patients with HIV in developed nations."

Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ancient retroviruses that infect Old and New World monkeys and apes. Although not known to cause disease, these viruses are of public health interest because they have the potential to infect humans and thus provide a more general indication of zoonotic exposure risks. Surprisingly, no information exists concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity of SFVs in wild-living monkeys and apes. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of SFVcpz infection in free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using newly developed, fecal-based assays. Chimpanzee fecal samples (n = 724) were collected at 25 field sites throughout equatorial Africa and tested for SFVcpz-specific antibodies (n = 706) or viral nucleic acids (n = 392). SFVcpz infection was documented at all field sites, with prevalence rates ranging from 44% to 100%. In two habituated communities, adult chimpanzees had significantly higher SFVcpz infection rates than infants and juveniles, indicating predominantly horizontal rather than vertical transmission routes. Some chimpanzees were co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz); however, there was no evidence that SFVcpz and SIVcpz were epidemiologically linked. SFVcpz nucleic acids were recovered from 177 fecal samples, all of which contained SFVcpz RNA and not DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial gag (616 bp), pol-RT (717 bp), and pol-IN (425 bp) sequences identified a diverse group of viruses, which could be subdivided into four distinct SFVcpz lineages according to their chimpanzee subspecies of origin. Within these lineages, there was evidence of frequent superinfection and viral recombination. One chimpanzee was infected by a foamy virus from a Cercopithecus monkey species, indicating cross-species transmission of SFVs in the wild. These data indicate that SFVcpz (i) is widely distributed among all chimpanzee subspecies; (ii) is shed in fecal samples as viral RNA; (iii) is transmitted predominantly by horizontal routes; (iv) is prone to superinfection and recombination; (v) has co-evolved with its natural host; and (vi) represents a sensitive marker of population structure that may be useful for chimpanzee taxonomy and conservation strategies."

The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

And also serum HBV markers were tested in these subjects. One hundred patients (18%) were anti-C100 HCV positive, indicating that this figure represents a much higher prevalence than that (0.9%) among general population in the same geographical area. Out of 141 patients without history of blood transfusion, 17 (12%) were positive for anti-C 100 HCV, suggesting that blood-transfusions-unrelated acquisition of HCV infection can occur. Anti-HCV prevalence correlated with both the blood units transfused and the duration of HD treatment. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of anti-C 100 HCV in individual dialysis units ranging from 0% to 53%. In the dialysis unit with prevalence of 53%, approximately half of the anti-HCV positive patients were found to have chronic liver disease. The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers among HD patients, on the other hand, was 36% (202/564). Fifty one (51%) of 100 anti-C 100 HCV positive patients and 151 (33%) of 464 anti-C 100 HCV negative patients were positive for HBV markers, with significant difference in HBV infection rate between the 2 groups. The prevalence of chronic liver disease, defined as abnormal serum transaminase levels for more than 6 months was significantly higher in anti-HCV positive patients than in anti-HCV negative ones (39% vs 10%, p less than 0.05), suggesting that HCV infection may contribute to chronic liver disease in HD patients. Among 145 staff members, only 3 (2%) were positive for anti-HCV, whereas 25 (17%) were positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), indicating prior HBV infection.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a key role in cancer invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix and basement membrane barriers. A cytosine (C)/thymidine (T) single nucleotide polymorphism at position -1562 in the MMP-9 promoter is reported to influence the expression of the MMP-9 gene. The association between MMP-9 gene polymorphisms and HCC patients with hepatitis C and B viruses (HCV and HBV) was examined in 91 patients with HCC and viral hepatitis (55 HCV and 36 HBV). The results were compared with those of 42 HCC patients without viral hepatitis and 60 healthy individuals with no liver infection. Polymorphisms of the MMP-9 gene were investigated by polymerase chain reaction amplification followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The serum MMP-9 level was quantitatively determined using a human MMP-9 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which showed that homozygosity of the MMP-9 promoter (TT) was more frequent in patients with HCC and chronic HCV or HBV infection when compared with the control group (49.1, 52.8, and 35.7%, respectively). In addition, we observed significant elevation of serum MMP-9 levels in all HCC groups compared to controls. It was concluded that patients with the MMP-9 TT genotype are at risk of developing HCC and HBV or HCV. People with significantly elevated serum levels of MMP-9 are at risk of developing HCC. "

Oncology patients receiving packed red blood cell suspensions and other blood products usually are in the high-risk group for infections due to these viruses. The aim of the study was to detect the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C among chemotherapy patients at the Oncology Department of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBcIgM, anti-HBc total and anti-HCV assays were studied by enzyme immunoassay method (Diasorin, Italy) in serum samples of patients (n = 448) referred to the Department of Oncology of the Tepecik Education and Research Hospital during 1 June 2006-1 January 2007. Of the 448 patients, 19 (4.2%) were HBsAg-positive, and three (0.7%) had anti-HCV positivity. In this study, the seroprevalence of HBV was similar to previous data in Turkey. This could be due to widespread vaccination programmes. The seroprevalence of low anti-HCV may be because of controlled blood transfusion. Oncology patients should be monitored for their protective antibody levels against HBV, and they must be included in the vaccination programme. Their anti-HCV status should also be checked as well."

He was admitted to our hospital for acute hepatitis caused by HBV. At that time, HIV-1antibody (Ab) was not detected in his serum. After 6 months, he was readmitted to our hospital for further examination of his liver because of confined liver enzyme abnormalities. Anti-HIV- Ab was detected in his serum by both enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) and particle agglutination (PA). His serum HIV-1 RNA level was 50 x 10(4) copies/ml and serum levels of HBV DNA polymerase (DNA-P) and HBV DNA were 6535cpm and 3 plus (>1000 copies/ml). His clinical course and laboratory data suggested progression from acute to chronic hepatitis related to coinfection with HIV-1. The diagnosis was chronic active hepatitis caused by HBV as an opportunistic infection due to coinfection with HIV-1. We began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) because interferon (IFN) therapy was ineffective. HAART was started at an initial dosage of 600 mg zidovudine (AZT), 300 mg lamivudine (3TC), and 2400 mg indinavir (IDV) daily. After 4 weeks, the serum level of HBV DNA-polymerase (p) had decreased markedly to 37cpm and that of HIV-1 RNA had decreased to below the sensitivity threshold, indicating considerable suppression of the replication of these viruses by the treatment. But HBV DNA remained at low levels. Although the incidence of HBV infection in patients with HIV-1 infection has been reported to be high in the United States and Europe, simultaneous HBV and HIV-1 infection leading to persistent HBV infection is rare."

The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and virologic characteristics of HBV genotypes in China and possible association with the diversity of liver disease. The study includes 1096 chronic HBV carriers from nine provinces in China. We collected clinical and laboratory data and analysed the HBV strains in sera by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and nucleotide sequencing techniques. The most common HBV genotypes were B (41%) and C (53%), while genotypes A and D were also found. A North-South divide was identified in genotype B and C distribution - genotype C was predominant in northern China, while genotype B was more prevalent in southern provinces. Patients with genotype B were younger than those with genotype C, and had a lower prevalence of HBeAg - 65%vs 72%, respectively (P = 0.03). However, the severity of liver disease did not differ significantly between patients infected with genotype B or C - neither when comparing liver function tests (1024 patients), nor hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (264 patients). Amongst 47 patients with genotype D (by PCR-RFLP), 37 (79%) were infected with a new subtype (designated Dc), having a recombination fragment from genotype C precore/core region. This is the first large-scale HBV genotype study from China and convincing documentation of the North-to-South gradient of genotypes C vs B in this country. HBV DNA recombination over the surface and precore/core genes increases the diversity of HBV strains and may have diagnostic and clinical implications."

HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa.

Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS.

In addition to being the most potent protease inhibitor in vitro, atazanavir has a distinct cross-resistance profile that does not confer resistance to other protease inhibitors. However, resistance to other protease inhibitors often confers clinically relevant resistance to atazanavir. Currently, atazanavir is not a preferred protease inhibitor for initial HAART regimens. In treatment-naive patients, atazanavir can be given as 400 mg/day. However, atazanavir should be pharmacologically boosted with ritonavir in treatment-experienced patients or when coadministered with either tenofovir or efavirenz. Patients who receive atazanavir experience similar rates of adverse events compared with patients receiving comparator regimens. An exception is an increased risk of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia, which is due to competitive inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. Although hyperbilirubinemia is a common adverse drug reaction of atazanavir therapy (22-47%), fewer than 2% of patients discontinue atazanavir therapy because of this adverse effect. Common adverse effects reported with atazanavir include infection, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, peripheral neuropathy, and rash. Of significance, fewer abnormalities have been observed in plasma lipid profiles in patients treated with atazanavir compared with other protease inhibitor-containing regimens. As with other protease inhibitors, atazanavir is also a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, in particular CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Clinically significant drug interactions include (but are not limited to) antacids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine type 2 receptor antagonists, tenofovir, diltiazem, irinotecan, simvastatin, lovastatin, St. John's wort, and warfarin. We conclude that atazanavir is a distinctively characteristic protease inhibitor owing to its in vitro potency, once-daily dosing, distinct initial resistance pattern, and infrequent association with metabolic abnormalities."

Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."

In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."

Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."

In this study, hepatic gene expression analysis was performed to identify any molecular signature associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chimpanzees. Acutely HCV-infected chimpanzees with self-limited infection or progression to chronicity were studied. Interferon stimulated genes were induced irrespective of the outcome of infection. Early induction of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and immune activation was associated with subsequent viral clearance. Specifically, two of the genes: interleukin binding factor 3 (ILF3) and cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA1), associated with robust T-cell response, were highly induced early in chimpanzees with self-limited infection. Up-regulation of genes associated with CD8+ T cell response was evident only during the clearance phase of the acute self-limited infection. The induction of these genes may represent an initial response of cellular injury and proliferation that successfully translates to a ""danger signal"" leading to induction of adaptive immunity to control viral infection. This primary difference in hepatic gene expression between self-limited and chronic infections supports the concept that successful activation of HCV-specific T-cell response is critical in clearance of acute HCV infection."

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."

The aim of our report is to perform an interim assessment of the background, the safety profile and the clinical-laboratory monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including raltegravir, for at least 12 months. In all, 109 pretreated patients started a raltegravir-containing cART when aged 44.8 plus or minus 19.2 years, with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.4 plus or minus 9.7 years. All subjects were monitored for at least 12 months (mean 17.2 plus or minus 10.3 months). In the vast majority of cases (93 of 109: 85.3%), multiple (3-16) prior cART changes prompted raltegravir introduction in advanced-salvage lines: 72 of 109 (66.1%) patients had even developed a concurrent triple-class resistance to anti-HIV compounds. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (75 cases), maraviroc (47 subjects), and etravirine (38 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (46 patients), liver cirrhosis (31 cases), AIDS-related or other malignancies (23 cases), and major cardio-cerebro-vascular events (18 cases). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 48 and 23 patients, respectively. The adjunct of raltegravir favourably affected all clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of the broad spectrum of comorbidities, except for two patients who failed the raltegravir-containing cART due to insufficient adherence. Despite the already compromised clinical situation, a minority of subjects experienced mild-transient clinical-laboratory untoward events possibly attributable to raltegravir, such that no patients discontinued raltegravir during the observation period. Only three AIDS-defining conditions became apparent during raltegravir-based cART; chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy cycles were performed as scheduled in patients suffering from cancer; chronic hepatitis B and C progressed to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatocarcinoma in only 2 and 6 patients. Otherwise, treatment with pegylated interferon-ribavirin became feasible in 25 patients of 48 with chronic HCV. During raltegravir-containing cART, neither autoimmune disorders nor novel malignancies were diagnosed. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disorders, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia and cutaneous rash were reported, although their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess due to multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Abnormal liver function testings were observed in 57 patients (52.3%), all suffering from concurrent hepato-biliary disorders. Significant increases in serum lipids and/or lipase levels versus baseline values were never registered: serum lipid levels significantly improved after raltegravir introduction. Our experience with raltegravir underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile, which exploits a novel mechanism of action, and displays no cross-resistance with any other antiretroviral. A progressively extended prescription in naive patients and early cART lines will allow the therapeutic potential of raltegravir to be exploited. "

Subjects included 82 women 18 years of age or older who were currently seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic. The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population. Quality of life information can assist programme planners in developing social and medical service delivery for women in the community thus facilitating the development of treatments, programmes and interventions aimed at increasing quality of life for this population."
2321,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."

Here we describe several highly attenuated second-generation RV-based vaccine vehicles expressing HIV-1 Gag. For this approach, we modified the previously described RV vaccine vector SPBN by replacing the arginine at position 333 (R333) within the RV glycoprotein (G) with glutamic acid (E333), deleting 43 amino acids of the RV G cytoplasmic domain (CD), or combining the R333 exchange and the CD deletion. In addition, we constructed a new RV vector that expresses HIV-1 Gag from an RV transcription unit upstream of the RV phosphoprotein gene (BNSP-Gag) instead of upstream of the G gene. As expected and as demonstrated for SPBN-Gag, all vaccine vehicles were apathogenic after peripheral administration. However, the new, second-generation vaccine vectors containing modifications in the RV G were also apathogenic after intracranial infection with 10(5) infectious particles, and BNSP-Gag produced a 50%-reduced mortality in mice. Of note, the observed attenuation of pathogenicity did not result in either the attenuation of the humoral response against the RV G or the previously observed robust cellular response against HIV-1 Gag. These findings demonstrate that very safe and highly effective RV-based vaccines can be constructed and further emphasize their potential utility as efficacious antiviral vaccines."
8611,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Approximately 50% of late-stage HIV patients develop CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus in addition to CCR5-tropic (R5) virus. X4 emergence occurs with a sharp decline in CD4+ T cell counts and accelerated time to AIDS. Why this phenotypic switch to X4 occurs is not well understood. Previously, we used numerical simulations of a mathematical model to show that across much of parameter space a promising new class of antiretroviral treatments, CCR5 inhibitors, can accelerate X4 emergence and immunodeficiency. Here, we show that mathematical model to be a minimal activation-based HIV model that produces a spontaneous switch to X4 virus at a clinically-representative time point, while also matching in vivo data showing X4 and R5 coexisting and competing to infect memory CD4+ T cells. Our analysis shows that X4 avoids competitive exclusion from an initially fitter R5 virus due to X4v unique ability to productively infect nave CD4+ T cells. We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells. We find that it is the ratio of the fractions of activated nave and memory CD4+ T cells that must increase above a threshold to produce a switch. This occurs as the concentration of CD4+ T cells drops beneath a threshold. Thus, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which increases CD4+ T cell counts and decreases cellular activation levels, inhibits X4 viral growth. However, we show here that even in the simplest dual-strain framework, competition between R5 and X4 viruses often results in accelerated X4 emergence in response to CCR5 inhibition, further highlighting the potential danger of anti-CCR5 monotherapy in multi-strain HIV infection."
9987,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) successfully escapes from host immune surveillance, vaccines and antiretroviral agents. The available antiretroviral compounds can only control viremia, but it is impossible to eliminate the virus from the organism, namely because HIV-1 provirus persists in the reservoir cells from which the virus repeatedly disseminates into new cells. Current therapeutic approaches, however, do not specifically address the stage of virus reactivation. Heme has been demonstrated as very efficient in inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcription, while its derivative hemin ameliorated HIV-1 infection via induction of heme oxygenase-1. Normosang (heme arginate; HA) is a human hemin-containing compound used to treat acute porphyria. In this work, we studied the effects of HA in HIV-1-acutely infected T-cell lines, and in cell lines harboring either a complete HIV-1 provirus (ACH-2 cells) or an HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" (Jurkat clones expressing EGFP under control of HIV LTR). We demonstrate that HA inhibited HIV-1 replication during the acute infection, which was accompanied by the inhibition of reverse transcription. On the other hand, HA alone stimulated the reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" and synergized with phorbol ester or TNF-α in the reactivation of HIV-1 provirus. The stimulatory effects of HA were inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine, suggesting an increased redox stress and activation of NF-κB. Further, HA induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ACH-2 cells, while HO-1 was found expressed in untreated Jurkat clones. Inhibitor of HO-1 activity, tin protoporphyrin IX, further increased HA-mediated reactivation of HIV-1 ""mini-virus"" in Jurkat clones, and this effect was also inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine. The stimulatory effects of HA on HIV-1 reactivation thus seem to involve HO-1 and generation of free radicals. Additionally, the effective concentrations of HA did neither affect normal T-cell activation with PMA nor induce activation of the unstimulated cells. In conclusion, HA appears to possess a combination of unique properties that could help to decrease the pool of latently infected reservoir cells, while simultaneously inhibiting HIV-1 replication in newly infected cells. Our results thus suggest a new direction to explore in treatment of HIV/AIDS disease."
6648,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"IL-23 regulates myriad processes in the innate and adaptive immune systems, and is a critical mediator of the proinflammatory effects exerted by Th17 cells in many diseases. In this study, we investigated whether and how hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver damage directly through the IL-23 signaling pathway. In biopsied liver tissues from HBV-infected patients, expression of both IL-23 and IL-23R was remarkably elevated. In vivo observations also indicated that the main sources of IL-23 were myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and macrophages. Analysis of in vitro differentiated immature DCs and macrophages isolated from healthy donors revealed that the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) efficiently induces IL-23 secretion in a mannose receptor (MR)-dependent manner. Culture with an endosomal acidification inhibitor and the dynamin inhibitor showed that, upon binding to the MR, the HBsAg is taken up by mDCs and macrophages through an endocytosis mechanism. In contrast, although the HBV core antigen (HBcAg) can also stimulate IL-23 secretion from mDCs, the process was MR- and endocytosis-independent. In addition, IL-23 was shown to be indispensible for HBsAg-stimulated differentiation of naïve CD4(+) T cells into Th17 cells, which were determined to be the primary source of IL-17 in HBV-infected livers. The cognate receptor, IL-17R, was found to exist on the hepatic stellate cells and mDCs, both of which might represent the potential target cells of IL-17 in hepatitis B disease. These data provide novel insights into a yet unrecognized mechanism of HBV-induced hepatitis, by which increases in IL-23 expression, through an MR/endocytosis-dependent or -independent manner, produce liver damage through the IL-23/IL-17 axis.

5517,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Substantial progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B during the past decade. Nucleos(t)ide analogues are now widely used due to their convenience, less side effects, and considerable response rates. However, development of antiviral resistance is a major problem being considered as the most important factor for the treatment failure. Viral breakthrough associated with selection of antiviral-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) is usually followed by biochemical breakthrough, clinical deterioration, and even progressive liver failure. Therefore, appropriate management of antiviral resistance is critical for improving treatment outcomes. Strategies for the management of antiviral-resistant chronic HBV infection are described herein considering recently published guidelines. Lamivudine/telbivudine resistance can be managed by adding adefovir. Switching to adefovir or entecavir is also a viable option. However, careful follow-up of viral load is mandatory to detect any primary or secondary treatment failure in case of sequential monotherapy. Interferon or peg-interferon therapy can also be considered in case of young patients with compensated liver disease. For adefovir resistance, lamivudine can be added, but adding or switching to entecavir is a more reasonable option. Likewise, adding or switching to adefovir can be considered for entecavir resistance. Adding or switching to tenofovir needs to be considered upon availability. Experiences for clevudine resistance are still lacking, and need to be studied further upon the isolation of clinically resistant strains. To avoid emergence of resistant mutations, antiviral therapy should be initiated after careful balance of risk and benefit, and the most potent antiviral agent with the lowest resistance rate should be selected."

For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
9973,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection affects approximately 375 million people worldwide. Current antiviral treatment effectively controls, but rarely clears chronic HBV infection. In addition, a significant portion of chronic HBV infected patients are not suitable for currently available antiviral therapy, and still face higher risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The poorly understood pathogenesis of HBV infection is the main barrier for developing more effective treatment strategies. HBV has long been viewed as non-cytopathic and the central hypothesis for HBV pathogenesis lies in the belief that hepatitis B is a host specific immunity-mediated liver disease. However, this view has been challenged by the accumulating experimental and clinical data that support a model of cytopathic HBV replication. In this article we systematically review the pathogenic role of HBV replication in hepatitis B and suggest possible HBV replication related mechanisms for HBV-mediated liver injury. We propose that a full understanding of HBV pathogenesis should consider the following elements. I. Liver injury can be caused by high levels of HBV replication and accumulation of viral products in the infected hepatocytes. II. HBV infection can be either directly cytopathic, non-cytopathic, or a mix of both in an individual patient depending upon accumulation levels of viral products that are usually associated with HBV replication activity in individual infected hepatocytes."

Four hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients attending the HIV outpatients clinic were studied: 359 men and 125 women, median age 29 years (range 16-67 years); 35.5% had presented acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining conditions. Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."

The level of viraemia is predictive of clinical outcome in that a reduced risk of progression to AIDS or death was observed with lower plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels. Rebound in viral levels often signals therapeutic failures, some of which are associated with the development of drug resistance. Quantitative plasma assays for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been developed. Over time, modifications to these assays have been required to meet new demands. For example, as antiviral therapies have become more effective, HIV and HCV assays of greater sensitivity are required in order to follow patients for longer periods of time and to fully assess the extent of viral suppression. For HIV-1, a large percentage of patients treated with combination therapies had viral loads that were below the detection limit of the ultrasensitive assay (50 copies/ml). To assess the residual viral burden in this patient population an assay to quantify HIV-1 proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was developed. Studies to date indicate that proviral DNA remains easily detectable despite undetectable plasma RNA and may be useful in monitoring this patient population. To increase assay throughput, a new generation of quantitative assays that will provide real-time detection and a 6 log10 detection range from a single amplification is under development."

Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."

Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."

Antiviral agents improve the quality of life and reduce the potential for spreading HIV; HIV is currently considered a chronic disease provided patients are compliant with their antiviral medications. Tenofovir is a nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor that prevents viral replication and is approved for treatment of HIV and chronic hepatitis B infection. Tenofovir is an antiretroviral drug used alone and in combination with other nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor agents to lower viral load in HIV patients. Tenofovir is administered as a prodrug to increase bioavailability. The prodrug forms of tenofovir are tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, approved in 2001, and tenofovir alafenamide, approved in 2016. Tenofovir is extensively used in controlling HIV, as it is administered once daily, allowing for good compliance. This minireview discusses the impact of food, age, and drug transporters on tenofovir absorption and clearance. The changes in dosing that are needed in the presence of renal impairment, which is a common occurrence with HIV chronic disease progression, will also be discussed. The potential special conditions occurring with fixed-combination doses containing tenofovir will also be reviewed, including the use of cobicistat, a cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor.

Depletion of Tregs has led to measurable increases in antigen-specific T cell responses in vaccine settings for cancer and infectious pathogens. However, their role in HIV-1 immuno-pathogenesis remains controversial, as they could either serve to suppress deleterious HIV-1-associated immune activation and thus slow HIV-1 disease progression or alternatively suppress HIV-1-specific immunity and thereby promote virus spread. Understanding and modulating Treg function in the context of HIV-1 could lead to potential new strategies for immunotherapy or HIV vaccines. However, important open questions remain on their role in the context of HIV-1 infection, which needs to be carefully studied. Representing roughly 5% of human CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood, studying the Treg population has proven to be difficult, especially in HIV-1 infected individuals where HIV-1-associated CD4 T cell and with that Treg depletion occurs. The characterization of regulatory T cells in individuals with advanced HIV-1 disease or tissue samples, for which only very small biological samples can be obtained, is therefore extremely challenging. We propose a technical solution to overcome these limitations using isolation and expansion of Tregs from HIV-1-positive individuals. Here we describe an easy and robust method to successfully expand Tregs isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals in vitro. Flow-sorted CD3(+)CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Tregs were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads and cultured in the presence of IL-2. The expanded Tregs expressed high levels of FOXP3, CTLA4 and HELIOS compared to conventional T cells and were shown to be highly suppressive. Easier access to large numbers of Tregs will allow researchers to address important questions concerning their role in HIV-1 immunopathogenesis. We believe answering these questions may provide useful insight for the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine."

Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."

We measured the prevalence of non-infectious illnesses and their risk factors and described healthcare use in this UK population. A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at an outpatient HIV specialist clinic in south east England. Patients age ≥50 years were invited to complete questionnaires measuring demographics, non-infectious illnesses, medication use, lifestyle and healthcare utilisation. The response rate was 67%. Of 299 participants, 84% reported ≥1 comorbid condition and 61% reported ≥2 (multimorbidity). Most commonly reported were high cholesterol, sexual dysfunction, hypertension and depression. In multivariate analyses, age, number of years HIV-positive and duration of antiretroviral therapy remained significant predictors of comorbidity when controlling for lifestyle factors (exercise, smoking and use of recreational drugs and alcohol). Use of non-HIV healthcare services was associated with increasing comorbidity, a longer duration of HIV and recreational drug use. The majority of HIV-patients aged ≥50 years reported multiple comorbidities and this was associated with polypharmacy and increased use of non-HIV services. Further research examining the quality, safety and patient experience of healthcare is needed to inform development of services to optimally meet the needs of older HIV-positive patients."

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in phase II trials. Intermittent administration of subcutaneous IL-2 results in substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in most HIV-patients. Two large-scale phase III international studies are addressing the key remaining question of the clinical benefit associated with CD4 cell expansions in HIV-infected patients receiving IL-2. Other cytokines including interferon-alpha are currently under investigation in phase II trials. The goal of therapeutic immunizations is to enhance and broaden the immune system's ability to recognize HIV. Several vaccine candidates, also tested as immunogens for preventive vaccines, are currently studied in phase II trials in patients exhibiting viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. It has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys'models that therapeutic immunizations can result in the induction of strong CD4 and CD8 responses associated with viral control and prevention of clinical AIDS, following challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of chimeric SIV-HIV. The clinical efficacy of immune-based strategies remains to be demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Participation of immune system to control of viral replication may allow simplification of antiretroviral treatment which results in long-term adverse effects having impact in life quality of persons living with HIV."

To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."

Blood markers of HIV infection and immune activation were measured at study entry, with optional cerebrospinal fluid measures. A high frequency of participants reported symptoms that exceeded published thresholds supportive of depression (55.0%) and anxiety (65.8%) at diagnosis, with significant reductions after starting cART.

5216,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The rate of viral replication appears to play a pivotal role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pathogenesis and disease progression as it outstrips the capacity of the immune system to respond. Important cellular sites for HIV-1 production include T lymphocytes and tissue macrophages. Antiviral strategies, including newer treatment modalities such as gene therapy of HIV-1-susceptible cell populations, must be capable of engendering durable inhibitory effects to HIV-1 replication in both of these primary cell types in order to be effective. Among the potential genetic targets for intervention in the HIV-1 life cycle, the Rev regulatory system, consisting of Rev and its binding site, the Rev-responsive element (RRE), stands out as particularly attractive. Rev is essential for maintaining the stability of the viral genomic RNA as well as viral mRNAs encoding key structural and regulatory proteins. Moreover, it exhibits favorable threshold kinetics, in that Rev concentrations must rise above a critical level to exert their effect. To disable Rev function, primary T cells or macrophages were transduced with anti-Rev single-chain immunoglobulin (SFv) or RRE decoy genes either singly or in combination by employing adeno-associated virus vectors and then challenged with HIV-1. By directing both a protein and a nucleic acid against the normal interaction between Rev and the RRE, this genetic antiviral strategy effectively inhibited infection by either clinical or laboratory virus isolates. These results provide a framework for novel interventions to reduce virus production in the infected host."
4259,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"It has previously been demonstrated that there are two distinct mechanisms for genetic resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conferred by the CCR5Delta32 gene: the loss of wild-type CCR5 surface expression and the generation of CCR5Delta32 protein, which interacts with CXCR4. To analyse the protective effects of long-term expression of the CCR5Delta32 protein, recombinant lentiviral vectors were used to deliver the CCR5Delta32 gene into human cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been immortalized by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Blasticidin S-resistant cell lines expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 showed a significant reduction in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion assays. It was shown that CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 gene were highly resistant to infection by a primary but not by a laboratory-adapted X4 strain, suggesting different infectivity requirements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed the CCR5Delta32 protective effects in a transient expression system, this study showed that long-term expression of CCR5Delta32 conferred resistance to HIV-1 despite cell-surface expression of the HIV co-receptors. The results suggest an additional unknown mechanism for generating the CCR5Delta32 resistance phenotype and support the hypothesis that the CCR5Delta32 protein acts as an HIV-suppressive factor by altering the stoichiometry of the molecules involved in HIV-1 entry. The lentiviral-CCR5Delta32 vectors offer a method of generating HIV-resistant cells by delivery of the CCR5Delta32 gene that may be useful for stem cell- or T-cell-based gene therapy for HIV-1 infection."

Increased PAF synthesis has been recently detected in HIV-infected patients. In this study, we examined in naive HIV-infected patients the in vivo effects of a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, containing tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz, on PAF metabolism. The specific activities of PAF basic biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT) and lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase (lyso-PAF-AT), but also the ones of PAF-basic catabolic enzymes, PAF acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leukocytes and platelets, and lipoprotein-associated-phospholipase-A(2) (LpPLA(2)) in plasma, were measured in blood samples of eight asymptomatic naive male HIV-infected patients just before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. CD4 cell counts, viral load, and several biochemical markers were also measured in the same blood samples of these patients. The repeated measures ANOVA and the Pearson r criterion were used to study statistical differences and correlations-partial correlations, while linear mixed models were conducted in order to estimate association(s) between time-dependent changes in these factors. Before treatment, the activities of PAF-CPT in leukocytes and LpPLA(2) in plasma were found to be inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts and positively correlated with the viral load. After 6 months of treatment, the activities of basic PAF-biosynthetic enzymes, PAF-CPT and lyso-PAF-AT, were both reduced in leukocytes. At 6 months, PAF-AH activity was also reduced in these cells, while LpPLA(2) remained stable. The reduction of PAF-CPT occurred even from the first month, while there is a time-dependent correlation between the increase of CD4 and the decrease of both viral load and PAF-CPT of leukocytes during treatment. Apart from its classical antiretroviral activities the tenofovir-DF/emtricitabine/efavirenz regimen also exhibited favorable effects on PAF metabolism and therefore may also display beneficial effects in some HIV-related conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in which PAF is implicated."

However, long-term treatment with existing NRTIs can be associated with significant toxic side effects and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. The identification of new NRTIs for the continued management of HIV-infected people therefore is paramount. In this report, we describe the response of a primary isolate of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA) both in vitro and in vivo. EFdA was 3 orders of magnitude better than tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (AZT), and emtricitabine (FTC) in blocking replication of SIV in monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro, and in a preliminary study using two SIV-infected macaques with advanced AIDS, it was highly effective at treating SIV infection and AIDS symptoms in vivo. Both animals had 3- to 4-log decreases in plasma virus burden within 1 week of EFdA therapy (0.4 mg/kg of body weight, delivered subcutaneously twice a day) that eventually became undetectable. Clinical signs of disease (diarrhea, weight loss, and poor activity) also resolved within the first month of treatment. No detectable clinical or pathological signs of drug toxicity were observed within 6 months of continuous therapy. Virus suppression was sustained until drug treatment was discontinued, at which time virus levels rebounded. Although the rebound virus contained the M184V/I mutation in the viral reverse transcriptase, EFdA was fully effective in maintaining suppression of mutant virus throughout the drug treatment period. These results suggest that expanded studies with EFdA are warranted."

Halofuginone (HF) is a plant alkaloid which has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in immune regulation. Our present study explored the function of HF in the immune response of HBV-infected Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Plasmid containing pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 was injected in SD rats for the construction of an acute HBV-infected animal model. Our data showed that HF reduced the high concentrations of serum hepatitis B e-antigen, hepatitis B surface antigen, and HBV DNA induced by HBV infection. HF also reduced the number of T helper (Th)17 cells and the expression of interleukin (IL)-17 compared with the pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 group. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-17, IL-23, interferon-γ, and IL-2) were downregulated and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-4 and IL-13) were upregulated by HF. Through further research we found that the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and IKBA which suppressed NF-κB activation was increased while the expression of p-NF-κB P65 was decreased in pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3+HF group compared with pCDNA3.1-HBV1.3 group, indicating that HF may work through the activation of AMPK. Finally, our conjecture was further verified by using the AMPK inhibitor compound C, which counteracted the anti-inflammation effect of HF, resulting in the decreased expression of AMPK, IKBA and increased expression of p-NF-κB P65 and reduced number of Th17 cells. In our present study, HF was considered as an anti-inflammatory factor in acute HBV-infected SD rats and worked through AMPK-mediated NF-κB p65 inactivation. This study implicated HF as a potential therapeutic strategy for hepatitis B."

The study participants were obtained by randomly selecting 10-household clusters from Unga limited, the town of Babati, and the roadside village of Matufa, which are urban, semi-urban, and rural communities, respectively. Informed verbal consent for participation in an interview and in HIV-1 testing was sought from each respondent. Blood samples were collected from each consenting individual for HIV-1 antibody testing using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and all positive sera were confirmed using repeated ELISA tests. Information of risk factors was obtained through the interview process using a structured questionnaire. Of the 567 women who gave blood samples, 48 (8.5%) were HIV-1 positive. The HIV-1 seroprevalence rates among women in the urban area, the semi-urban area, and the rural village were 14.4%, 6.9% and 2.3%, respectively. Factors associated with significantly higher HIV-1 seroprevalence were urban residence; history of having traveled out of the Arusha region within Tanzania, as well as having traveled abroad; having multiple sex partners; and having sexual intercourse under the influence of alcohol. Women who reported ever having used condoms had significantly higher probability of being infected with HIV-1 than those who had never used condoms, suggesting that condom use may be a marker of high-risk sexual behavior and that condom use is probably not adhered to in a way that consistently protects against HIV-1 infection. These results suggest the need for health education interventions aimed at increasing appropriate and consistent condom use and reduction of the number of sexual partners."

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."

Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."

Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."

However, the prevalence of escape mutations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients has not been systematically studied in patients from southern China within the past decade. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of escape mutations within the MHR of hepatitis B virus in patients in Dongguan, southern China. Between June 2015 and May 2016, 391 patients who were chronically infected with HBV were enrolled in the study, including 240 patients with the genotype B strain and 151 with the genotype C strain. The most frequent mutated position was s126 (4.3%), followed by s100 (3.3%), s101 (2.8%), s133 (2.8%), s145 (2.3%), s120 (2.0%) and s129 (1.8%). Furthermore, the mutations sY100C, sQ101R/K, sS114A, sP120T, sT/I126A/N/S, sQ129R, sM133L/T/S and sG145R/A were prevalent in at least one genotype, with a frequency higher than 1%, which indicated that these mutations were relatively common. In addition, sQ101K/R was found only in genotype C isolates (P < 0.05), and sT126A was only discovered in genotype B isolates (P = 0.047), indicating that such mutations were genotype-associated mutations. Notably, combinations of escape mutations within the MHR were also frequently discovered in genotypes B (5.0%) and C (6.6%), with no significant difference (P = 0.498). These results indicated that we should increase the surveillance HBsAg mutations among HBV-infected patients in China."

The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."

The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States.

Two back-calculation models of the HIV and the HCV epidemic were developed. They were based on US epidemiological data regarding prevalence, age and gender of incident cases, AIDS, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mortality and general population mortality from the Centers for Disease Control and WHO. Based on the HCV back-calculation model, HCV incidence peaked in 1984 at 350,000 new infections and then fell to about 77,000 in 1998. Based on the HIV back-calculation model, HIV incidence reached its maximum in 1989 at 142,000 new infections and then declined to 79,000 in 1998. Mortality related to HCV (death from liver failure or HCC) rose from about 3,700 in 1998 and is expected to peak at about 13,000 in 2030. Predicted HCV mortality would fall only if increased access to or more effective antiviral therapy occurs. For comparison, observed HIV-related mortality was 14,400 in 1998 and projected to be 4,200 for 2030. With the availability of effective highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection, mortality from HIV appears to have declined substantially, whereas HCV-related deaths as a result of pre-1999 infections will likely continue to increase over the next 25 years."

In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."

Recent reports have described a significant association between inheritance of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, associated with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and PCT. A strong association between hepatitis C virus infection and PCT has also been demonstrated, while case reports record a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and PCT. We have investigated the frequency of these factors in a racially-mixed population of patients with PCT in Cape Town, South Africa. 57 patients with PCT drawn from three ethnic groups were screened for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations linked to GH, and the prevalences were compared with corresponding healthy control populations. The seroprevalence of markers for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV infection were examined in 28 of these. In the control populations, we found that both the C282Y and H63D mutations are highly prevalent in South Africans of European origin. In a population of mixed or Asian origin, the C282Y mutation is very rare whereas the H63D mutation is common. Neither mutation was encountered in any African subject. Both mutations are associated with PCT, but the association is dependent on the ethnic origins of the population to which the patient belongs. In contrast to other studies, HCV infection is numerically unimportant in PCT in our patients. HIV infection is increasingly encountered in our patients with PCT, but the strength of the association cannot be determined in view of the high background prevalence of HIV infection in some sectors of the South African population. The contribution of specific risk factors may be heavily dependent on the population from which patients are drawn, and care should be taken in extrapolating from observations in one racial or geographic population to any other."

Current guidelines state that the goal of therapy is to achieve and maintain HIV-1 RNA below detectable levels, with recommendations to switch regimens upon virologic failure based on the adverse consequences of higher degrees of viremia. With the introduction of potent, newer agents, the likelihood of achieving this goal in treatment-experienced patients is growing. Not all patients who experience virologic failure while on therapy suffer from immediate virologic and immunologic decline; some experience persistently low, but detectable, levels of HIV-1 RNA in the range of 50-1000 copies/mL. The threshold at which low-level viremia (LLV) becomes predictive of disease progression varies between studies, although evidence shows that incomplete viral suppression leads to the accumulation of resistance mutations with a concomitant increase in viral replication, reduction in CD4 cell counts, increased risk of virologic progression, and clinical deterioration. Furthermore, with increasing resistance, future treatment options are compromised. Although there are clinical consequences when a patient is maintained on a failing regimen, it may be preferable to delay a switch in therapy if the chance for resuppression is low. With the introduction of new ARVs within existing classes that have shown significant activity against resistant virus, as well as the introduction of two new classes of ARV agents, HIV treatment has entered a new era. The options for constructing regimens active against multidrug-resistant virus have expanded."

However, the complexity of the HIV-infected patient and the combinations of medications used to treat HIV complicate the understanding of the independent effects of PIs in the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). I discuss the current understanding of PI-associated hepatotoxicity. Of the PI regimens studied, the greatest risk of DILI has been observed among patients receiving full-dose ritonavir. Similarly, hepatitis B and/or C virus coinfection has been associated with a greater risk of DILI, compared with those with no hepatitis. Although the specific mechanism by which viral hepatitis increases this risk is not known, patients with cirrhosis may have decreased cytochrome P450 activity, leading to increased PI exposure. Clearly, further research is needed to define the interaction of PIs and chronic viral hepatitis in the development of DILI."

In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."

Nevirapine may be prescribed for patients with hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Significant autoinduction of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2B6 following multiple dosing prompted an assessment of the metabolic profiles in patients with liver disease receiving chronic nevirapine therapy. HIV-infected patients with hepatic fibrosis who were receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine for > or = 6 weeks had liver biopsy specimens assessed by Ishak histologic scoring and were grouped by severity (group 1, Ishak scores of 1 and 2; group 2, Ishak scores of 3 and 4; group 3, Ishak scores of 5 and 6). Steady-state trough nevirapine levels were determined for all patients, and additional measurements were obtained at 1, 2, and 4 h following nevirapine dosing for a subset of patients. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and its five metabolites were characterized, and a comparison of the results for the different Ishak groups was performed. Among 51 patients with hepatic fibrosis, the majority of whom were coinfected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, differences between the maximum and the minimum observed plasma concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant flattening of the systemic exposure curves with progression from Ishak group 1 to Ishak group 2 or 3, suggesting a decrease in systemic clearance with the progression of liver disease. However, there were no significant differences in the trough and the maximum nevirapine concentrations between the Ishak groups. The metabolite profiles were also comparable across the Ishak groups. In HIV-infected patients who were chronically treated with nevirapine and who had various degrees of hepatic fibrosis, including cirrhosis, trough plasma nevirapine concentrations were not significantly increased, and thus, no dose adjustment is warranted."

In the United States, HBV infection is commonly associated with high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use or unprotected sex; but it is not as well-known among health care providers that HBV can be transmitted from mother to baby during birth. Worldwide, the majority of cases of chronic HBV infection are in people who contracted the virus during birth. There is a lack of awareness in the United States that immigrants from HBV-endemic countries may be at high risk for chronic HBV. Thus, at-risk individuals may not be screened for HBV. The most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend HBV screening for all people born in Asia, all U.S.-born persons who were unvaccinated as infants and whose parents were born in regions of high HBV endemicity (> or = 8%), and individuals with parenteral risk factors. Screening for HBV starts with HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HBsAb (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen), and total anti-HBc (total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) testing. For those who are HBV-negative (HBsAg-negative) and have no evidence of prior immunity, the three-part HBV vaccination series is recommended."

Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."

CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts were prospectively measured for up to 720 days in 46 antiviral drug-naive persons with very early HIV infection, documented by HIV antibody seroconversion. HIV viral RNA levels were measured subsequently on reposited plasma samples from these same time points. The median viral load ""set point"" for Indian seroconverters was 28,729 RNA copies/ml. The median CD4(+) cell count following acute primary HIV infection was 644 cells/mm(3). Over the first 2 years since primary infection, the annual rate of increase in HIV viral load was +8274 RNA copies/ml/year and the annual decline in CD4 cell count was -120 cells/year. Although the viral ""set point"" was similar, the median trajectory of increasing viral load in Indian seroconverters was greater than what has been reported in untreated HIV seroconverters in the United States. These data suggest that the more rapid HIV disease progression described in resource-poor settings may be due to very early virological and host events following primary HIV infection. A rapid increase in viral load within the first 2 years after primary infection may have to be considered when applying treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis."

Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."

The spectrum of renal impairment is very wide from clinically insignificant to end stage renal disease and often requires nephrologist's consultation. Therefore, we established combined renal and HIV care in the HIV Out-Patient Clinic in Warsaw. Medical records of patients consulted by nephrologist from March 2014 to March 2015 were included in analyses. Patients changing medication without consulting the physician or persistently not coming for follow-up visits were defined as non-compliant. In statistical analyses, non-parametric tests and logistic regression models were used as appropriate. In total, 100 patients were consulted by a nephrologist during the study period. All patients were white Europeans, 88 (88%) male, 42 (42%) infected through men having sex with men and 16 (16%) through intravenous drug users. Fifteen (15%) patients had hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and 11 (11%) confirmed with positive HCV RNA. The most common reasons for referral were proteinuria and increased serum creatinine. In 6 out of 31 patients (19.3% of those referred for increased creatinine level) elevated serum creatinine was due to illegal substances or diet supplements use. Fifty-seven (57%) of patients were non-compliant. In univariate logistic regression models, all tested factors were non-significant. In most cases, patients were referred to nephrologist due to possible link between laboratory abnormalities and antiretroviral treatment. In one out of five cases, elevated creatinine level was linked with substance/dietary abuse. Poor compliance is an important problem in integrated nephrological care, however we were not able to identify any factors associated with non-compliance."

Our aim in the present study was to assess trends in the prevalence of infection with hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV, respectively). We also investigated the coinfection rates of HBV and HCV with HIV in the same groups. Between 2007 and 2012, HBV prevalence was significantly decreased in BD (18.1% vs. 9.0%, p = 0.007) and slightly decreased in FSW (11.0% vs. 3.9%, p = 0.21), but not in PWID (10.7% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.84). HCV prevalence was significantly decreased in PWID (62.1% in 2007 vs. 42.7% in 2008, p < 0.0001), but it had rebounded to 58.4% in 2012 (2008 vs. 2012, p < 0.0001). HCV prevalence also increased in FSW: 28.6% in 2007 and 2009 vs. 35.3% in 2012; however, this difference was not significant (2007 vs. 2012, p = 0.41). Rates of coinfection with HBV and HCV among HIV-infected PWID and FSW did not change significantly during the study period. Our findings suggest that the current harm reduction programs designed to prevent HIV transmission in PWID and FSW may be insufficient to prevent the transmission of hepatitis viruses, particularly HCV, in Haiphong, Vietnam. New approaches, such as the introduction of catch-up HBV vaccination to vulnerable adult populations and the introduction of HCV treatment as prevention, should be considered to reduce morbidity and mortality due to HIV and hepatitis virus coinfection in Vietnam."

This study appraised these parameters, and efficacy of generic ARVs. Consenting 106 HIV infected ARV naïve patients were enrolled. CD4 T lymphocyte and plasma HIV RNA levels were determined at interval for 24 months. Ninety eight (92.5%) of the patients who completed the follow up in strict adherence to therapy guideline were included in the analysis. Baseline median CD4 T lymphocyte increased from 114 (Range: 6-330) to highest 357 (Range: 15-1036) cells/ μ L at 18 months of therapy, while baseline median plasma viral RNA declined from 4.6 (Range: 2.6-6.0) Log10 copies/mL to undetectable level within three months of therapy. Significant CD4 T-cell restoration and plasma viral RNA decline in the study population demonstrate efficacy of the generic HAART.

Many HIV-associated oral infections occur early in HIV disease, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of the associated oral opportunistic infections should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Cytology, a simple, painless, and inexpensive method, has become a preferred method and was used in our study for early diagnosis of certain lesions. To determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on incidence rate of opportunistic infections among HIV-positive adults in a teaching hospital in India, a prospective study was conducted and the required sample size was 40. Study participants were selected randomly from the outpatient department of an HIV clinic who were currently on for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD4 lymphocytes per milliliter, and viral load were collected. Oral cytologic investigation was carried out and then stained for histopathological examination. A total of 40 individuals were examined and the incidence of opportunistic infections was 66.7% in individuals with CD4 counts less than 200, 55.6% in individuals with CD4 counts of 200 to 499, and 40.0% in individuals with CD4 counts more than 500.

Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."

The aim of this study is to determine patient, disease, and factors associated with peripheral arterial disease in a population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Methods A prospective nested case-control study of a cohort of patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome was conducted in a tertiary medical center in Mexico City. A sample size of 206 patients was calculated. Medical history, relevant laboratory data, peripheral arterial exam, and screening ankle-brachial index tests were obtained. Results The prevalence of abnormal ankle-brachial indexes was 20% (42 patients). Patient's mean age was 44 years ±13. The majority (98.5%) were actively receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy; active smoking was reported in 55 (27%), arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in 24 (12%) and 22 (11%) patients. Median time from the human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis was eight years (Interquartile range ±11); the mean CD4 count was 481, with a mean viral load of 13,557 copies (SD ± 69025.27) and 1889.18 (SD ± 9052.77) for patients with normal and abnormal ankle-brachial index and a median of 40 (IQ ± 2). Viral load ( p = 0.04) and number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( p = 0.04) were significantly associated with abnormal ankle-brachial indexes. Conclusions Abnormal ankle-brachial index seems to be more frequent in Mexican patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when compared with the general population at the same age. The most important factors associated with arterial disease were the viral load and the number of years with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

To study the viral functions responsible for deleterious effects on the host cell, we quantitated the course of HIV type 1 infection in tissue cultures by using flow cytometry for a virally encoded marker protein, heat-stable antigen (HSA). We found that HSA appeared on the surface of the target cells in two phases: passive acquisition due to association and fusion of virions with target cells, followed by active protein expression from transcription of the integrated provirus. The latter event was necessary for decreased target cell viability. We developed a general mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro in terms of three effective time-dependent rates: those of cell proliferation, infection, and death. Using this model we show that the predominant contribution to the depletion of viable target cells results from direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade. This allows us to derive accurate bounds on the time-dependent death rates of infected cells. We infer that the death rate of HIV-infected cells is 80 times greater than that of uninfected cells and that the elimination of the vpr protein reduces the death rate by half. Our approach provides a general method for estimating time-dependent death rates that can be applied to study the dynamics of other viruses."

The features of HCV infection in the study patients provided a fair representation of the variables that are usually found in considering patients for IFN treatment. The same was true for the features of TTV infection. In particular, plasma loads of TTV varied over a wide range in individual patients, and infection with multiple TTV genogroups was extremely frequent. TTV genogroups 1 and 3 were the most prevalent, followed by genogroups 4 and 5. The HCV response to IFN was evaluated by measuring plasma viraemia at 24 hours and 30 days after initiation of treatment. The results showed that the TTV parameters investigated had little or no impact on the response of HCV to therapy. Due to study design, these results do not exclude that the presence of a concomitant TTV infection can affect how HCV infection responds to treatment. However, they indicate that, should such effects exist, they would be independent on load and genetic features of the infecting TTV."

We characterized the diversity and catalytic efficiency of HCV NS3/4A protease quasispecies in AHC patients coinfected with HIV-1. Plasma samples obtained at HCV diagnosis from 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients with AHC were studied. Five HCV monoinfected patient samples with AHC were also investigated. An average of 39 clones from each sample was analysed. The catalytic efficiency of the dominant quasispecies (i.e. the most abundant) from each quasispecies was also assayed for mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) cleavage. Phylogenetic analysis identified two clusters of patients with highly related viruses, suggesting a common source of HCV infection. None of the 18 MSM HIV-coinfected patients spontaneously cleared HCV, although 78% of the treated patients achieved a sustained virological response after early treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) plus ribavirin (RBV). The synonymous-nonsynonymous (ds/dn) mutation ratio, a marker of selective pressure, was higher in AHC compared to 26 HIV-1-infected men with genotype 1a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) (P < 0.0001). NS3/4A proteases from AHC patients also exhibited higher catalytic efficiency compared to CHC patients (P < 0.0001). No differences were found when ds/dn mutation ratios and NS3/4A protease catalytic efficiencies from AHC HIV-coinfected patients were compared with AHC monoinfected patients. The presence of epidemiological networks of HCV transmission was confirmed among HIV-1-positive MSM. In addition, substantial genetic diversity was demonstrated in AHC. NS3/4A protease efficiency cleaving MAVS may be associated with virus transmission and response to pegIFN/RBV treatment."

On admission, her vital signs were: pulse of 88, respiration rate of 18, temperature of 37.7 degrees C, and blood pressure of 126/76. Her only medication was phenytoin. On examination, the patient was found to have multiple umbilicated papules on her face, as well as painful, erythematous, large, punched-out ulcers on the nose, face, trunk, and extremities of 3 months' duration (Fig. 1). The borders of the ulcers were irregular, raised, boggy, and undermined, while the base contained hemorrhagic exudate partially covered with necrotic eschar. The largest ulcer on the left mandible was 4 cm in diameter. The oral cavity was clear. Because of her subtherapeutic phenytoin level, the medication dose was adjusted, and she was empirically treated with Unasyn for presumptive bacterial infection. Chest radiograph and head computed tomography (CT) scan were within normal limits. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was negative. Serologic studies, including Histoplasma antibodies, toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M (IgM), rapid plasma reagin (RPR), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies were all negative. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid was within normal limits without the presence of cryptococcal antigen. Blood and cerebrospinal cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi were all negative. Viral culture from one of the lesions was also negative. The analysis of her complete blood count showed: white blood count, 2300/microl; hemoglobin, 8.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 25.7%; and platelets, 114,000/microl. Two days after admission, the dermatology service was asked to evaluate the patient. Although the umbilicated papules on the patient's face resembled lesions of molluscum contagiosum, other infectious processes considered in the differential diagnosis included histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Penicillium marnefei. In addition, the morphology of the ulcers, particularly that on the left mandible, resembled lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum. A skin biopsy was performed on an ulcer on the chest. Histopathologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis with multiple budding yeast forms, predominantly within histiocytes, with few organisms residing extracellularly. Methenamine silver stain confirmed the presence of 2-4 microm fungal spores suggestive of Histoplasma capsulatum (Fig. 2). Because of the patient's deteriorating condition, intravenous amphotericin B was initiated after tissue culture was obtained. Within the first week of treatment, the skin lesions started to resolve. Histoplasma capsulatum was later isolated by culture, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was continued on amphotericin B for a total of 10 weeks, and was started on lamivudine, stavudine, and nelfinavir for her HIV infection during hospitalization. After amphotericin B therapy, the patient was placed on life-long suppressive therapy with itraconazole. Follow-up at 9 months after the initial presentation revealed no evidence of relapse of histoplasmosis."

The male partners of all HIV-infected women attending the centers were invited to participate in the study. Of the 275 male partners who were tested for HIV and interviewed with use of a structured questionnaire, 51 were excluded because they had other possible risk factor for HIV infection, no established risk factor was found in the index case, or they had stopped engaging in sexual intercourse. Fourteen of the 224 men (6.3%) were seropositive for HIV. At logistic regression, the highest risks of transmission were for men practicing peno-anal intercourse [odds ratio (OR), 4.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0-22.2] and for men whose partner had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or a CD4+ lymphocyte count of < or = 400/mm3. No seropositive men were observed among those who were aware of the woman's HIV seropositivity since the beginning of the relationship or were partners of a zidovudine-treated woman. The results suggest that the risk factors described in man-to-woman and man-to-man HIV sexual transmission also operate in woman-to-man transmission."

This analysis, encompassing the period end-December, 1984, to beginning-August, 1991, focuses on risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection. Rate of vertical transmission, based on 721 children born to 701 mothers more than 18 months before the time of analysis, was 14.4% (95% Cl 12.0-17.1%). Transmission was associated with maternal p24-antigenaemia and a CD4 count of less than 700/microliters. In a multivariate analysis, odds ratios of transmission were: 2.25 (95% Cl 0.97-5.23) in breastfed children vs never-breastfed children; 3.80 (1.62-8.91) in children born before 34 weeks' gestation; and 0.56 (0.30-1.04) in children delivered by caesarean section. Transmission was higher with vaginal deliveries in which episiotomy, scalp electrodes, forceps, or vacuum extractors were used, but only in centres where these procedures were not routine. On the basis of these results, HIV-infected women contemplating pregnancy should be counselled according to their immunological findings and, if they have p24-antigenaemia or a low CD4 count, warned of an increased risk of viral transmission. Caesarean deliveries may have a protective effect, although it is premature to recommend routine operative delivery. The mechanism for the higher infection rate in children born before 34 weeks' gestation is unclear, but could reflect inadequate passive or active immunity at that age, combined with substantial transmission during labour or delivery. The balance of evidence suggests that mothers with established infection can transmit HIV infection through breastmilk, although the relative importance of this route remains to be defined."

Eighty per cent of them have a chronic HIV infection at the first clinical evaluation, which is symptomatic (late presenters) in up to 30% of patients. The initial evaluation of HIV infection is not only directed at determining the clinical, virological (plasma HIV RNA viral load, resistance test and viral tropism) and immunological (CD4+ T-cell cell count) situation of the patients, but must also address the study of their co-infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis) and comorbidities (cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and bone) and the risk of HIV transmission. This is needed in order to decide, whether or not to start antiretroviral treatment, and with which combined antiretroviral treatment to start with, the prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, and the treatment of coinfections and comorbidities. The past and current medical history, the physical examination and laboratory tests will help us decide if the patient is to receive therapeutic intervention. The level of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes is the best marker to suggest when to start combined antiretroviral treatment, indicating whether or not to start prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (if patients have a CD4+ T-cell count below 200 cells/mm(3)), and in advanced patients should make us suspect the presence of active opportunistic diseases in symptomatic cases. The management of patients with HIV infection must also include appropriate health education on the modes of transmission and prevention of HIV infection, and also to explain its natural history and how it can be modified with proper antiretroviral treatment, as well as to promote a healthy life. No less important is the psychological support, as these patients must learn to live with a chronic infection, which managed properly can ensure a very good long-term prognosis and quality of life."

The objectives were, a) to document in the different parts of Spain the number of HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers, and b) to identify the risk factors involved in the HIV infection. Only in public hospitals, a total of 1938 HIV+ children born to HIV+ mothers were identified. A systematic yearly increase of HIV+ newborns was evident since 1985. Madrid, Catalonia, Valencia, Basq and Andalucia communities incorporated 85% of all cases. 93% of mothers were IVDU and 51% of them were married. Prematurity occurred in 27% of cases and low birth weight in 33% of NB's. The rate of transmission in children over 18 months of age was 25.6% Breast feeding could be a risk factor in the transmission of HIV infection observed in children over 18 months of age. No other maternal risk factors responsible for the HIV transmission were identified. 12% of children died with AIDS. Clinical classification and evolution of HIV infection did not significantly differ from similar studies in other parts of the world. In spite of only public hospitals being involved, Spain has more identified HIV+ children than Italy, Switzerland, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden and Belgium combined. The pediatric centres with large number of cases require interdisciplinary pediatric specialized units to cope with the increase demand of medical services, now inadequate and insufficient. To fight drug use and HIV infection in Spain, health education and family support, are indispensable in trying to arrest the continuous spread the HIV infection."

These patients received T20 plus an antiretroviral regimen and were followed-up over a period of 40-72 weeks. In one non-responder patient, N43D substitution was detected at 12 weeks of treatment, in association with a value of T20-IC50 of 10 microg/ml (10-fold increase). Double mutations N42T + N43D were observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks and remained detectable up to 16 weeks after the withdrawal of the drug. The S138A substitution in HR2 was observed in plasma RNA at 32 weeks, and both in plasma RNA and in PI DNA at 40 weeks, associated with an increase of the T20-IC50 to 25 microg/ml (25-fold increase). Mutations V101G and E137K, not reported previously, were also observed in the HR2 region. Whether these new substitutions play a role in T20 resistance needs to be examined. In three temporary responders, coinciding with viral load rebound, G36D, and N42T substitutions were observed at 12, 24, and 40 weeks. G36D mutation was associated with a value of T20-IC50 of 5 microg/ml. The HR2 S138A mutation was detected after the detection of HR1 substitutions and was associated with an increase in the level of T20-IC50 to 125 microg/ml (125-fold increase) All these data reinforce the role of gp41 amino acids 36-45 and the potential influence of the HR2 S138A mutation in the genotypic/phenotypic resistance to T20."

HIV-1-infected patients who received nevirapine-based approaches for at least 4 years were identified in the databases of five centers and included in a retrospective cohort study. Data collected included plasma HIV-RNA (viral load) and CD4+ T-cell counts, lipid and liver function tests, at baseline, 2-year and > 4-year time points. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection, adverse events, and reasons for using nevirapine were also recorded. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients (139 males/90 females) were included. The mean age was 37 years (range 20-59). Most patients (n = 124; 54%) were former intravenous drug users. One hundred and thirty-five of the patients (59%) were coinfected with HCV. Median time on nevirapine was 72.6 months. The main reasons for nevirapine use included: second- or third-line therapy (39%), simplification of therapy (29%), first-line therapy (18%) and efavirenz intolerance (9%). LDL cholesterol and triglycerides decreased during the >4-year follow-up (135 mg/dl to 109 mg/dl, p = 0.04; and 216 mg/dl to 153 mg/dl, p<0.01, respectively), and HDL cholesterol increased from 48 mg/dl at baseline to 62 mg/dl (p<0.01). Liver enzymes remained without significant changes during follow-up. The reported follow-up pattern of laboratory tests was also found in the subset of HCV-coinfected patients, where men and women were compared and patients with a CD4+ cell count cut-off value of 250/mm(3) were stratified. Mean CD4+ T-cell counts increased from 439/mm(3) at baseline to 628/mm(3) at the last available visit (p<0.001). Ninety-four per cent (172 out of 184) of patients who remained on nevirapine-based therapy at last visit maintained viral load values below the limit of detection (<50 copies/ml). Throughout the follow-up nevirapine was stopped or withdrawn in 43 patients due to virological failure (n = 17), toxicity (n = 5), therapy interruption (n = 3), death (n = 2), dyslipidemia (n = 1), simplification (n = 1) or unknown reasons (n = 14). Adverse events were reported in 40 patients but none was directly attributed to nevirapine. Nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy provides sustained immunological and virological effectiveness over a more than 4-year treatment period as well as a beneficial lipid metabolic profile and a favorable safety profile, even in HCV-coinfected patients and women with CD4+ cell counts above 250/mm(3). The study data support a nevirapine-based approach as a suitable long-term strategy in the HIV-1-infected population."

However, the pathogenesis of HBV infection and the mechanisms of host-virus interactions are still elusive. In this study, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based comparative proteomics were applied to analyze the host response to HBV using an inducible HBV-producing cell line, HepAD38. Twenty-three proteins were identified as differentially expressed with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) as one of the most significantly up-regulated proteins induced by HBV replication. This induction was further confirmed in both HepAD38 and HepG2 cells transfected with HBV-producing plasmids by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting as well as in HBV-infected human liver biopsies by immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of GRP78 expression by RNA interference resulted in a significant increase of both intracellular and extracellular HBV virions in the transient HBV-producing HepG2 cells concomitant with enhanced levels of hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen in the culture medium. Conversely overexpression of GRP78 in HepG2 cells led to HBV suppression concomitant with induction of the positive regulatory circuit of GRP78 and interferon-beta1 (IFN-beta1). In this connection, the IFN-beta1-mediated 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and RNase L signaling pathway was noted to be activated in GRP78-overexpressing HepG2 cells. Moreover GRP78 was significantly down-regulated in the livers of chronic hepatitis B patients after effective anti-HBV treatment (p = 0.019) as compared with their counterpart pretreatment liver biopsies. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that GRP78 functions as an endogenous anti-HBV factor via the IFN-beta1-2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway in hepatocytes. Induction of hepatic GRP78 may provide a novel therapeutic approach in treating HBV infection."

We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."

In this study, we have identified and characterized a relatively conserved epitope in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase recognized by murine and human cytotoxic T cells. This epitope was identified using a murine antigen-specific CD8+ class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) line, a transfected fibroblast cell line expressing the HIV-1 pol gene, recombinant vaccinia viruses containing different truncated versions of the pol gene, and overlapping synthetic peptides. The optimal antigenic site was identified as residues 203-219 by synthesizing extended or truncated peptide analogs of the antigenic fragment. The optimal peptide was then tested for sensitization of autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell targets for killing by fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It was recognized by CTLs from several HIV-seropositive patients but not from any seronegative donor. Therefore, this peptide is a good candidate for inclusion in an AIDS vaccine. This study demonstrates that the same CTL epitope can be seen by murine and human CD8+ CTLs, as previously demonstrated for epitopes recognized by CD4+ helper T cells, and suggests the utility of screening for immunodominant CTL epitopes in mice prior to carrying out studies in humans."

Between June 2012 and October 2013, unselected patients admitted to medical wards at a public sector district hospital in Cape Town were enrolled in this cross-sectional study with prospective follow-up. HIV testing was systematically offered and HIV-infected patients were systematically screened for TB. The spectrum of admission diagnoses among HIV-positive patients was documented, vital status at 90 and 180 days ascertained and factors independently associated with death determined. Among 1018 medical admissions, HIV status was ascertained in 99.5%: 60.1% (n = 609) were HIV-positive and 96.1% (n = 585) were enrolled. Of these, 84.4% were aware of their HIV-positive status before admission. ART status was naive in 35.7%, current in 45.0%, and interrupted in 19.3%. The most frequent primary clinical diagnoses were newly diagnosed TB (n = 196, 33.5%), other bacterial infection (n = 100, 17.1%), and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining illnesses other than TB (n = 64, 10.9%). By 90 days follow-up, 175 (29.9%) required readmission and 78 (13.3%) died. Commonest causes of death were TB (37.2%) and other AIDS-defining illnesses (24.4%). Independent predictors of mortality were AIDS-defining illnesses other than TB, low hemoglobin, and impaired renal function. HIV still accounts for nearly two-thirds of medical admissions in this South African hospital and is associated with high mortality. Strategies to improve linkage to care, ART adherence/retention and TB prevention are key to reducing HIV-related hospitalizations in this setting."

Since new antiretroviral drugs with favorable resistance profiles are limited, innovative strategies are urgently needed. Treatment interruptions can lead to a loss in HIV resistance followed by improved response to reinitiated therapy. The authors report the case of a patient with sustained antiretroviral response for 3.5 years after a 7-month treatment interruption. Concomitant with an increase in replication capacity, multidrug-resistant viruses gradually disappeared during treatment interruption. Resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) was completely lost, and resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was still present when therapy was reinitiated. PI-resistant variants were not detected at four time points after treatment reinitiation. The alignment of the nucleic acid sequences from all different time points suggested that the viruses obtained after treatment reinitiation evolved from less-resistant variants prior to treatment interruption. This was supported by in vitro propagation of the viral plasma population and an individual clone derived from the time point of treatment interruption. This is consistent with a model favoring reversible binding of HIV-1 to reservoirs, as has recently been proposed for follicular dendritic cells. Understanding of this process could help to exploit the reduced fitness of drug-resistant viruses for treatment interruptions."

In the present study, a cohort of 287 HIV-1 seropositive patients and 388 ethnically age-matched healthy controls from Han Chinese population were enrolled in order to determine the influence of host genetic factors on HIV-1 infection. A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. A cross-sectional comparison between HIV-1 seropositive patients and healthy controls did not reveal significant differences with regards to DC-SIGNR genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygotes proportion. In addition, previous studies showed that DC-SIGNR might play different roles in different HIV infection routes. We stratified the patients into two subgroups: sexual contact patients and intravenous drug abuser/blood transfusion patients. Our results showed the frequencies of DC-SIGNR genotypes/alleles in these two subgroups were similar. To our knowledge, this is the first study performed in Northern Chinese. Our findings suggested that DC-SIGNR neck region VNTR polymorphism was not directly associated with hosts' predisposition for HIV-1 infection and not associated with the HIV-1 routes of infection. By lack of HIV-1 exposed seronegative (HESN) individuals and relative small sample size in present study made our conclusions not strong enough. In addition, the role of the DC-DIGNR neck region in different HIV-1 infection routes remains open for future study."

A new technique was developed to quantify proviral HIV-1 using a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. One copy of proviral HIV-1 DNA could be detected with 100% sensitivity for five copies and the assay had a range of 6 log(10). Reproducibility was evaluated in intra- and interassays using independent extractions of the 8E5 cell line harboring the HIV-1 proviral genome (coefficients of variation [CV], 13 and 27%, respectively) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a patient with a mean proviral load of 26 copies per 10(6) PBMC (CV, 46 and 56%, respectively). The median PBMC proviral load of 21 patients, measured in a cross-sectional study, was determined to be 215 copies per 10(6) PBMC (range, <10 to 8,381). In a longitudinal study, the proviral load of 15 out of 16 patients with primary infection fell significantly during 1 year of antiretroviral therapy (P = 0.004). In the remaining patient, proviral HIV-1 DNA was detectable but not quantifiable due to a point mutation at the 5' end of the TaqMan probe. No correlation was observed between proviral load and levels of CD4(+) cells or HIV-1 RNA in plasma. TaqMan PCR is sensitive and adaptable to a large series of samples. The full interest of monitoring proviral HIV-1 DNA can now be ascertained by its application to the routine monitoring of patients."

Some patients appear to benefit from structured treatment interruptions (STI), involving monitored repetition of on-and-off cycles of drugs; however, it is unclear whether patients and/or physicians should consider STI as a treatment option. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive update on the use of STI in clinical settings, and to carefully evaluate the advantages and potential risks for patients infected with HIV. We used a MEDLINE search to find all English-language articles published January 1999 to August 2001 regarding patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy for whom treatment interruption was investigated. Priority was assigned to peer-reviewed sources, when available. Otherwise, abstracts from authoritative international conferences were selected through the AIDSLINE database. Results from various studies with respect to type of drug treatment, baseline patient status, number of treatment interruptions, duration of treatment and interruption, changes in viral load, and immune system parameters were analyzed. Patients could be categorized into 3 distinct clinical scenarios: acute infection, chronic drug-suppressed infection and virological drug failure. The STI approach may offer more benefit during acute infection when the patient's immune system remains nearly intact. It is yet to be determined whether STI will facilitate the long-term management of chronic infection by decreasing drug-associated toxicity and improving quality of life without jeopardizing the efficacy of the treatment. Results from randomized controlled trials and more definitive means of gauging the status of the patient's immune system must be available before this treatment method is extended beyond the research setting. Ultimately, a safer approach using therapeutic immunization or vaccination would be preferable for stimulating vigorous T-cell-mediated immune responses and control of HIV during treatment interruption."
199,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The term 'genotyping' describes the genetic characterization of a genome. The genotype analysis is performed to identify mutations that differentiate one individual or strain from another. The mutations may confer resistance to specific antiviral drugs or they may simply allow classification of a strain as to 'type' and 'subtype'. There are four human viruses for which genotype information is clinically useful. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are being treated with antiretroviral drugs and resistance after prolonged treatment is common. Since HBV cannot be cultured, the only method of detecting resistance-conferring mutations in the genome is a genotypic analysis. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured by treatment with the combination of interferon and ribavirin but certain strains of virus are more resistant to treatment than others. The current recommendations are that all HCV type 1 infections be treated for 12 months whereas other types may be successfully treated in 6 months. Since interferon treatment may have significant side effects, the determination of HCV genotype is an important aspect of this therapeutic regimen. Treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease with nucleoside analogues occasionally results in resistant virus with mutations in the phosphotransferase gene (UL97) and/or the DNA polymerase gene (UL54) that can be tested with phenotypic or genotypic assays. Since CMV grows very slowly, it may be more clinically useful to perform a rapid genotypic assay although only the UL97 gene can be efficiently genotyped. Finally, the virus for which genotyping has become the standard of care, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can now be genotyped routinely by many clinical virology labs experienced with molecular amplification methods and automated DNA sequencing technology. All currently-available antiretroviral drugs are directed against either the protease or reverse transcriptase genes of HIV-1 and the mutations within these genes that confer resistance have been well described. Sequence-based genotyping methods are not necessarily the best approach for routine genotyping of these four viruses, but sequencing is the gold standard from which other methods are developed and against which they are compared."

To verify the frequency of mutations in the Langerin gene, 118 samples from HIV-1-infected women and 99 samples from HIV-1-uninfected individuals were selected for sequencing of the promoter and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD)-encoding regions of the Langerin gene. Langerin promoter analysis revealed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one mutation in both studied groups, which created new binding sites for certain transcription factors, such as NFAT5, HOXB9.01 and STAT6.01, according to MatInspector software analysis. Three SNPs were observed in the CRD-encoding region in HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals: p.K313I, c.941C>T and c.983C>T. This study shows that mutations in the Langerin gene are present in the analysed populations at different genotypic and allelic frequencies. Further studies should be conducted to verify the role of these mutations in HIV-1 susceptibility. "

This study was designed to generate and compare in vitro ISRs to those isolated from HIV-infected individuals throughout the world. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were dually infected with seven pairs of HIV-1 isolates from different subtypes (i.e., A to F). Recombinant crossover sites were mapped to specific regions in the envelope (env) gene by using a cloning-hybridization technique and subtype-specific probes. In vitro intersubtype recombination was at least twofold more frequent in the V1-to-V3 region than in any other env fragment, i.e., C1 to V1, V3 to V5, or V5 to gp41. Sequence and recombination site analyses suggested the C2 env domain as a ""hot region"" for recombination and selection of replication-competent ISRs during the 15-day incubation. In addition to these regional preferences for env recombination, homopolymeric nucleotide tracts, i.e., sequences known to pause reverse transcriptase and promote template switching, were found in most in vitro crossover sites. ISRs, originating from recent dual infections and limited transmission events, partly retained this in vitro regional or sequence preference for recombination sites. However, a shift to crossover sites flanking the gp120-coding sequence was evident in the stable circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1. Based on these findings, HIV-1 recombinants generated from these dual infections may be used as a model for in vivo intersubtype recombination and for the design of various diagnostic assays and vaccine constructs."
1283,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"AIDS is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome defined by a severe depletion of T cells and over 20 conventional degenerative and neoplastic diseases. In the U.S. and Europe, AIDS correlates to 95% with risk factors, such as about 8 years of promiscuous male homosexuality, intravenous drug use, or hemophilia. Since AIDS also correlates with antibody to a retrovirus, confirmed in about 40% of American cases, it has been hypothesized that this virus causes AIDS by killing T cells. Consequently, the virus was termed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and antibody to HIV became part of the definition of AIDS. The hypothesis that HIV causes AIDS is examined in terms of Koch's postulates and epidemiological, biochemical, genetic, and evolutionary conditions of viral pathology. HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates: (i) free virus is not detectable in most cases of AIDS; (ii) virus can only be isolated by reactivating virus in vitro from a few latently infected lymphocytes among millions of uninfected ones; (iii) pure HIV does not cause AIDS upon experimental infection of chimpanzees or accidental infection of healthy humans. Further, HIV violates classical conditions of viral pathology. (i) Epidemiological surveys indicate that the annual incidence of AIDS among antibody-positive persons varies from nearly 0 to over 10%, depending critically on nonviral risk factors. (ii) HIV is expressed in less than or equal to 1 of every 10(4) T cells it supposedly kills in AIDS, whereas about 5% of all T cells are regenerated during the 2 days it takes the virus to infect a cell. (iii) If HIV were the cause of AIDS, it would be the first virus to cause a disease only after the onset of antiviral immunity, as detected by a positive ""AIDS test."" (iv) AIDS follows the onset of antiviral immunity only after long and unpredictable asymptomatic intervals averaging 8 years, although HIV replicates within 1 to 2 days and induces immunity within 1 to 2 months. (v) HIV supposedly causes AIDS by killing T cells, although retroviruses can only replicate in viable cells. In fact, infected T cells grown in culture continue to divide. (vi) HIV is isogenic with all other retroviruses and does not express a late, AIDS-specific gene. (vii) If HIV were to cause AIDS, it would have a paradoxical, country-specific pathology, causing over 90% Pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi sarcoma in the U.S. but over 90% slim disease, fever, and diarrhea in Africa.(viii) It is highly improbable that within the last few years two viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) that are only 40% sequence-related would have evolved that could both cause the newly defined syndrome AIDS. Also, viruses are improbable that kill their only natural host with efficiencies of 50-100%, as is claimed for HIVs. It is concluded that HIV is not sufficient for AIDS and that it may not even be necessary for AIDS because its activity is just as low in symptomatic carriers as in asymptomatic carriers. The correlation between antibody to HIV and AIDS does not prove causation, because otherwise indistinguishable diseases are now set apart only on the basis of this antibody. I propose that AIDS is not a contagious syndrome caused by one conventional virus or microbe. No such virus or microbe would require almost a decade to cause primary disease, nor could it cause the diverse collection of AIDS diseases. Neither would its host range be as selective as that of AIDS, nor could it survive if it were as inefficiently transmitted as AIDS. Since AIDS is defined by new combinations of conventional diseases, it may be caused by new combinations of conventional pathogens, including acute viral or microbial infections and chronic drug use and malnutrition. The long and unpredictable intervals between infection with HIV and AIDS would then reflect the thresholds for these pathogenic factors to cause AIDS diseases, instead of an unlikely mechanism of HIV pathogenesis."

The highly conserved 30 amino-acid membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV gp41 contains the hydrophobic epitopes for two rare HIV-1 broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10. Both these antibodies possess relatively hydrophobic HCDR3 loops and demonstrate enhanced binding to their epitopes in the context of the native gp160 precursor envelope glycoprotein by the intimate juxtaposition of a lipid membrane. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) S1 protein forms nanoparticles that can be utilized both as an immunogenic array of the MPER and to provide the lipid environment needed for enhanced 2F5 and 4E10 binding. We show that recombinant HBsAg particles with MPER (HBsAg-MPER) appended at the C-terminus of the S1 protein are recognized by 2F5 and 4E10 with high affinity compared to positioning the MPER at the N-terminus or the extracellular loop (ECL) of S1. Addition of C-terminal hydrophobic residues derived from the HIV-1 Env transmembrane region further enhances recognition of the MPER by both 2F5 and 4E10. Delipidation of the HBsAg-MPER particles decreases 2F5 and 4E10 binding and subsequent reconstitution with synthetic lipids restores optimal binding. Inoculation of the particles into small animals raised cross-reactive antibodies that recognize both the MPER and HIV-1 gp160 envelope glycoproteins expressed on the cell surface; however, no neutralizing activity could be detected. Prime:Boost immunization of the HBsAg-MPER particles in sequence with HIV envelope glycoprotein proteoliposomes (Env-PLs) did not raise neutralizing antibodies that could be mapped to the MPER region. However, the Env-PLs did raise anti-Env antibodies that had the ability to neutralize selected HIV-1 isolates. The first generation HBsAg-MPER particles represent a unique means to present HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein neutralizing determinants to the immune system."

A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."

This is defined as taking more than 95% of their prescribed doses. To our knowledge, no study in Ethiopia has evaluated the level of treatment adherence at the beginning of the child's treatment. Our aim was therefore to evaluate caregiver-reported ART non-adherence among children and any predictors for this during the early course of treatment. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 306 children with HIV in eight health facilities in Ethiopia who were registered at ART clinics between 20 December 2014 and 20 April 2015. The adherence rate reported by caregivers during the first week and after a month of treatment initiation was 92.8% and 93.8%, respectively. Our findings highlight important predictors of non-adherence. Children whose caregivers were not undergoing HIV treatment and care themselves were less likely to be non-adherent during the first week of treatment (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and the children whose caregivers did not use a medication reminder after one month of treatment initiation (aOR = 5.21, 95% CI: 2.23, 12.16) were more likely to miss the prescribed dose. Moreover, after one month of the treatment initiation, those receiving protease inhibitor (LPV/r) or ABC-based treatment regimens were more likely to be non-adherent (aOR = 12.32, 95% CI: 3.25, 46.67). To promote treatment adherence during ART initiation in children, particular emphasis needs to be placed on a baseline treatment regimen and ways to issue reminders about the child's medication to both the health care system and caregivers. Further, large scale studies using a combination of adherence measuring methods upon treatment initiation are needed to better define the magnitude and predictors of ART non-adherence in resource-limited settings."

Poor retention in clinical care has been associated with higher mortality, an increase in HIV RNA, and decreased CD4 cell count. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the health care utilization and health outcomes of HIV-infected racial/ethnic minority YMSM enrolled in an outreach, linkage, and retention study funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). We hypothesized that among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, baseline CD4 counts and usage of ART are influenced by age, race, drug and alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. Overall, 155 subjects had at least a baseline CD4 count recorded at study entry. There was a low rate of ART use in this population with only one-half of the cohort with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm(3) being prescribed ART to treat their infection. However, of those youth who were started on ART, the majority (74%) did achieve undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies). Given the continued increase in cases of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, efforts to increase both the provision of ART and support services that encourage adherence in this population are warranted."

We studied patients with HIV who use alcohol and associated socio-demographic, health and psychosocial factors. Outcomes from this study may help in selecting patients from clinical practice with high-risk alcohol use and who are likely to benefit most from alcohol reduction interventions. In a cross sectional study in three primary health care clinics in Pretoria, South Africa, from January 2012 to June 2012, patients with HIV infection were interviewed and patients' medical files were reviewed to obtain data on levels of alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test), patients' socio-demographic characteristics, HIV-related information, health related quality of life (WHOQoL-HIVBref), internalized AIDS stigma, symptoms of depression and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, bi- and multivariate logistic regression models. A total of 2230 patients (1483 [66.5%] female) were included. The median age was 37 years (interquartile range 31-43), 99.5% were black Africans, 1975 (88.6%) had started ART and the median time on ART was 22 months (interquartile range 9-40). No alcohol was used by 64% of patients, 8.9% were low risk drinkers, 25.1% of patients were hazardous or harmful drinkers and 2.0% had possible alcohol dependence. In multivariate analysis high-risk drinking was positively associated with male gender, never being married, tobacco use, a higher score for the 'level of independence'-domain measured with the WHOQoL-HIVBref questionnaire, and with more depressive symptoms compared to low-risk drinking. This study shows a high prevalence of hazardous or harmful drinking in patients with HIV infection (especially men) attending primary health care clinics in South Africa. Routine screening for alcohol use should be introduced in these clinics and harm reduction interventions should be evaluated, taking into account associated factors."

HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."

In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."

We explored the initial molecular events that act upstream from mitochondrial dysfunction in CD4(+) T lymphocytes exposed to the HIV-1(LAI) strain. We tracked by immunofluorescence the cells expressing the p24 viral antigen and used Percoll density gradients to isolate a nonapoptotic CD4(+) T-cell subset with a high inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsim) but no outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) rupture. In most p24(+) (but not bystander p24(-)) cells of this subset, the lysosomes were undergoing limited membrane permeabilization, allowing the lysosomal efflux of cathepsins (Cat) to the cytosol. This was also induced by HIV-1 isolates from infected patients. Using pepstatin A to inhibit Cat-D enzymatic activity and Cat-D small interfering RNA to silence the Cat-D gene, we demonstrate that once released into the cytosol, Cat-D induces the conformational change of Bax and its insertion into the OMM. Inhibition of Cat-D activity/expression also conferred a transient survival advantage upon productively HIV-1-infected cells, indicating that Cat-D is an early death factor. The transfection of activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes with a Nef expression vector rapidly induced the permeabilization of lysosomes and the release of Cat-D, with these two events preceding OMM rupture. These results reveal a previously undocumented mechanism in which Nef acts as an internal cytopathic factor and strongly suggest that this viral protein may behave similarly in the context of productive HIV-1 infection in CD4(+) T lymphocytes."
9054,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV1) infection is associated with severe psoriasis, B cell lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. A deregulated production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormal IL-6 secretion of HIV1-infected cells may include transactivation of the IL-6 gene by HIV1. To test this hypothesis, we used the pIL6Pr-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) plasmid, an IL-6 promoter-CAT construct, as a target of the transactivating function of the HIV1 TAT protein. By cotransfecting the pIL6Pr-CAT and the tat-expressing pSVT8 plasmid in MC3 B-lymphoblastoid or in HeLa epithelial cells, we observed that TAT transactivates the human IL-6 promoter. These results were confirmed when pIL6Pr-CAT was transfected in MC3 or HeLa cells that constitutively expressed the tat gene in a sense (pSVT8 cells) or antisense (pSVT10 cells) orientation. 5' deletion plasmids of pIL6Pr-CAT, in which regions at -658, -287, and -172 were inserted 5' to the cat gene, were transiently transfected in pSVT10 and pSVT8 cells and showed that TAT-induced activation of the IL-6 promoter required a minimal region located between -287 and -54 bp. Moreover, experiments with plasmids carrying the -658, -287, and -172 bp regions of the IL-6 promoter inserted downstream to a TAR-deleted HIV1-LTR identified the sequence of -172 to -54 as the minimal region of the IL-6 promoter required for TAT to transactivate the TAR-deleted HIV1-LTR. By DNA-protein binding experiments, tat-transfected cells expressed a consistent increase in kappa B and nuclear factor (NF)-IL-6 binding activity. Accordingly, the pDRCAT and IL-1REK9CAT, carrying tandem repeats of NF-kappa B or NF-IL6 binding motifs, respectively, were activated in TAT-expressing cells. The biological relevance of the TAT-induced IL-6 secretion was addressed by generating 7TD1 cells, an IL-6-dependent mouse cell line, stably expressing the tat gene. These tat-positive cells expressed the endogenous IL-6 gene, secreted high amounts of murine IL-6, and grew efficiently in the absence of exogenous IL-6. Moreover, the tat-positive 7TD1 cells sustained the growth of parental 7TD1 cells and showed a dramatic increase in their tumorigenic potency. These results suggest that TAT protein may play a role in the pathogenesis of some HIV1-associated diseases by modulating the expression of host cellular genes."

In June 1991, a 4 year prospective follow-up programme was implemented in 184 consecutive haemodialysis patients. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamine transferase (GGT) were performed every 2 months. When HCV antibody (Ab) (by second-generation ELISA) was positive, it was confirmed by RIBA 2 and HCV RNA amplification by PCR. The pattern of nucleotide sequence variability in the 5' non-coding region was categorized according to Simmonds' genotype classification. Risk factors including blood transfusions were evaluated. The levels of hepatic enzymes in HCV Ab-positive patients were retrospectively studied over a mean period of 11.8 years. ALT and GGT levels were assigned a score for every year of infection (0 = normal, 1 = fluctuating 2 = high levels). Fifty-two patients were HCV Ab reactive (30.4%), eight were RIBA undetermined and 44 were RIBA positive; 40 of these were HCV RNA positive (91%). Twelve patients were HCV RNA negative, suggesting that they had recovered from the infection. Four genotypes were identified: 1b [26 patients (65%)], 1a (one patient), 2 [12 patients (30%)] and 3 (one patient). The genotype distribution was not different from that found in patients with chronic hepatitis C and normal renal function of the same geographical area. Genotype 1b accounted for 75% of the cases before 1985 and an equal prevalence of the two major genotypes was observed after 1985. Patients infected with HCV subtype 1 had normal mean ALT levels, but higher levels in the follow-up period (28 +/- 15.6 IU/l) and higher ALT and GGT personal scores in the retrospective study. Genotype 1 patients had higher mean ALT levels after 6 months. HCV RNA-negative patients had lower ALT levels after 24 months. RIBA pattern could differentiate the patients. Patients with genotype 1 received a higher number of transfusions, while only 50% of HCV RNA-negative patients had been transfused. Our data suggest a worse course of HCV infection in haemodialysis patients infected with HCV subtype 1, but the severity of HCV infection can only be assessed by histology. Transaminases are only loosely correlated with severity."

Each co-formulated tablet will contain 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 200 mg of emtricitabine. Emtricitabine [Emtriva] is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) with demonstrated potent activity against HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). It was first approved in the US by the FDA in July 2003 and is indicated for adults aged > or =18 years. Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established. In antiretroviral-treatment-experienced patients, the use of emtricitabine may be considered for adults with HIV strains that are expected to be susceptible to the drug as assessed by genotypic or phenotypic testing. The recommended dose of emtricitabine is one 200 mg capsule daily, with or without food. In the European Union, emtricitabine is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV in adults and children, where it is also licensed as an oral 10 mg/mL solution. The oral solution is for use in infants older than 4 months, children and patients unable to swallow hard capsules, and patients with renal impairment who require dose reduction. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Viread] is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients. The drug was first approved in the US in October 2001, followed by further approvals in the European Union, Australia, Iceland, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. The drug has been launched in all these countries. In February 2003, the EMEA's advisory committee adopted a positive opinion to extend the indication of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in all 15 member states to include the product's use in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected patients. In July 2003, Japan Tobacco signed an agreement with Gilead for the commercialisation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine and the future co-formulation of these two drugs within Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, Japan Tobacco will be submitting an application to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for regulatory approval of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. On 15 March 2004, Gilead announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US FDA and a Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) to the EMEA for marketing approval of the fixed-dose co-formulation of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. The MAA will be reviewed under the centralised procedure, which, when finalised, will provide one marketing authorisation in all 25 member states of the enlarged European Union. Gilead anticipates launching the combination pill on the US market early in 2005. Regulatory filings for marketing approval in Japan by Japan Tobacco are also expected during 2004. In August 2003, Gilead announced that enrollment had begun in a 48-week phase III study (Study 934) evaluating the efficacy of a once-daily regimen of Viread and Emtriva versus Combivir. The open-label, multicentre trial will enroll up to 500 treatment-naive, HIV-infected patients in the US and Europe.

We utilized this approach to examine human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope DNA sequences (V1, V2, and V3) isolated from different brain compartments of a T-cell-depleted patient diagnosed with severe HIV-associated dementia at the time of death. In agreement with previous reports, phylogenetic analysis showed distinct virodemes but also revealed a significant amount of viral gene flow among different brain compartments. Local-molecular-clock analysis showed that HIV-1 meninges and temporal lobe subpopulations evolve about 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than the other viral populations in the brain. However, maximum likelihood codon-based substitution models did not detect any site under significant positive selective pressure, and the main cause of HIV-1 genetic variation appeared to be random genetic drift. Therefore, the higher evolutionary rate in the meninges and temporal lobe could be due to an enhanced infection/expansion rate of macrophages as a consequence of the immune system failure. In conclusion, in this case study, viral infection in the brain progressed with a nonspecific genetic evolution, recurrent migration events, and an expansion of macrophage-tropic sequences. The data suggest that after immune failure newly produced viral variants, which would be rapidly cleared under normal conditions, begin to productively infect macrophages in a ""self-amplifying"" cycle of infection/inflammatory response that could be at the origin of HIV-associated dementia."

Every year, 0.5-1.2 million people die of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHBVI), and approximately 60% of liver cancers are related to CHBI and subsequent liver cirrhosis (LC). These HBVI-related diseases impose a considerable economic burden as well as morbidity on patients, families, and society. Family and twin studies have indicated that the host genetic constitution greatly influences the clinical outcomes of HBV infection. During the past several years, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified susceptibility variants for various HBVI-related diseases. Of these variants, SNPs rs3077 and rs9277535 in HLA-DP on chromosome 6 show the strongest evidence for association with CHBVI and with viral clearance. However, whether there exists an association between HLA-DP variants and the progression of CHBVI remains to be determined. Thus, further study should focus not only on identifying more variants in HLA-DP that are associated with various HBVI-related diseases but also on characterizing any newly discovered functional variants at the molecular level. Further, given the complexity of CHBV infection and its progression, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions should also be taken into consideration. Moreover, because both smoking and alcohol affect HBV infection and progression, it is important to understand how these factors interact with genetics to influence HBV-related diseases."

However, the determinants of disability among this emergent population are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the correlates of prevalent disability in adults ≥50 years with HIV infection. A cross-sectional study of 184 HIV-infected adults receiving ambulatory care in an HIV clinic of a tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital in Mexico City was conducted. Disability for instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (ADL) was established. Sociodemographic factors, clinical variables, current CD4(+) cell count, and HIV viral load (VL) were tested as potential determinants of disability. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the correlates of both types of disability. The mean age was 59.3 years. All participants were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Of participants 17.9% had disability for IADL and 26.1% for ADL. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that being older; having a lower CD4(+) cell count, and having a detectable HIV VL were independently associated with both types of disability. In addition, educational level was also independently associated with ADL disability. Age, educational level, low CD4(+) cell count, and detectable HIV VL were independently associated with disability. Whether effective and timely antiretroviral therapy will reduce the risk of disability in HIV-infected elderly patients needs to be evaluated. "

This retrospective cohort study included patients aged 15 years and older who started HAART for the first time between January 2003 and December 2008 in 14 health districts. We used survival analyses, including the Kaplan-Meier method, to examine potential predictors of death and two Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios for death, first from baseline covariates and then from time-dependent covariates. A total of 6641 patients initiated HAART during this period; of these, 5608 were included in the analysis. By the end of the study period, 4310 of those patients were still receiving HAART, 690 had died, 207 had been transferred and 401 were lost to follow-up. The median duration of follow-up was 23.2 months [interquartile range (IQR): 12.4-36.9], and the overall incidence of mortality was 6 per 100 person-years. The clinical stage, CD4 count, body mass index (BMI), haemoglobin level, HAART regimen, gender, age, profession and year of initiation were the primary risk factors associated with death. In the multivariate analysis, BMI, clinical stage, treatment regimen and CD4 count remained significantly associated with death. The most frequent causes of death were wasting syndrome, tuberculosis and anaemia. This result highlights the already advanced stage of immunodeficiency among patients in Burkina Faso when they start HAART. Testing patients for HIV and starting antiretroviral therapy earlier are necessary to further reduce the mortality of patients living with HIV. This study provides a solid evidence base with which future evaluations of HAART in Burkina Faso can be compared."

Treatment with lamivudine is initially efficient in both infections but the incidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV emergence increases over time. Adefovir appears to be promising in post-liver transplantation patients with recurrent HBV infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV. This study analyzed adefovir treatment in 42 post-liver transplantation patients who developed recurrent HBV or de novo HBV infection with lamivudine-resistant HBV (54.8% HCV-coinfected). Patients received 10 mg of oral adefovir once daily for a mean period of time of 21.5 months (range from 12 to 31 months). In 62.9% of patients, ALT levels decreased significantly. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 64% of the cases. Twenty percent of patients lost HBeAg marker and 13.3% of them developed anti-HBe. In 9.5% of recipients, HBsAg became negative. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels. In only one patient was worsening of the renal function detected, making dose adjustment necessary. No other side effects were reported. Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of adefovir treatment in post-liver transplantation patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, neither were adefovir-resistant mutations identified in patients after 21 months of therapy, nor were there adverse events, especially renal toxicity."

As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."

This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."

Indeed, they are crucial for the regulation of T lymphocyte homeostasis because they can influence cell proliferation. A strong debate exists on the importance of Fas/FasL system during HIV infection, which is characterized by the loss of CD4+ T cells directly, or indirectly, caused by the virus. To investigate whether the genetic background of the host plays a role in the immunoreconstitution, we studied the influence of different Fas and FasL polymorphisms on CD4+ T lymphocyte count and plasma viral load following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in drug-naïve HIV+ patients. We studied 131 individuals, who were compared to 136 healthy donors. Statistical analysis was performed by using Chi2 test, Fischer's Exact Test, and analysis for repeated measurements. The group of HIV+ patients had an unexpected lower frequency of FasLnt169 polymorphism (delT allele) than healthy controls (p = 0.039). We then observed no significant differences in the immune reconstitution, in terms of CD4+ T cell increase, when the influence of single alleles of the gene Fas or FasL was considered. However, the combination of some polymorphisms of Fas or FasL significantly influenced CD4+ T cell production and viral load decrease, showing that these genes can play a role in the immunoreconstitution triggered by antiretroviral therapy."

Fifty-one percent of the patients were hepatitis C antibody positive and 34% hepatitis B core antibody positive. None of the patients had antibodies against HIV or HTLV. Eighteen percent of the patients had an elevated alanine aminotransferase activity. Abnormal alanine aminotransferase was significantly associated with hepatitis C seropositivity. No new seroconversions were detected among the haemophiliacs or patients with type 3 von Willebrand disease when compared with the last two surveys in 1993 and 1996, and there was no seroconversion in sole users of solvent/detergent-treated factor products.

The fraction of patients' lymphocytes that migrated across endothelial cell monolayers in vitro was significantly increased (p < or = 0.03) compared with that of control donors. Migration of patients' CD4+ T cells was particularly enhanced, whereas the migration of monocytes did not differ between patients and controls. Lymphocyte migration correlated with expression of CD11a/CD18 and CD49d/CD29 and with the quantity of TNF-alpha produced as MNLs migrated through the endothelium. Measurement of HIV-1 proviral DNA copies in the patients' MNLs (n = 26) suggested that in half the cases virus-infected cells accumulated preferentially amidst the migratory leukocytes. We observed the same behavior with normal donor MNLs infected, in vitro, with each of 4 strains of HIV-1. The number of HIV-1 proviral DNA copies per million MNLs was 40 to 178 times higher in the migratory population than in the original population added to the endothelium. To test whether only certain strains of HIV-1 stimulate transendothelial migration of infected cells, we used single strand conformation polymorphism analysis to identify quasispecies of HIV-1 in the MNLs. If all strains of HIV-1 were equal in their ability to stimulate transendothelial migration, we expected to find no differences in the quasispecies present in the original and migratory cell populations. In fact the quasispecies differed in 14 of 19 paired samples, suggesting that only certain HIV-1 quasispecies promote transendothelial migration of infected cells."

Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."

Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."

The route of transmission of HBV and HCV is mainly parenteral, a small number of epidemiological studies demonstrating that perinatal, sexual, household and occupational transmission occurs. Contact of a patient's blood or bodily fluids with non-intact skin is another mode of HBV and HCV transmission. Barbers in Turkey may often be exposed accidentally to the blood and bodily fluids of their customers. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in barbers. We conducted a study to determine the prevalence of antibodies against HBV and HCV among 176 barbers and 180 control subjects in the Sivas region of Turkey. The prevalence of HBV and HCV was found to be higher in barbers (39.8 and 2.8%, respectively) than in a comparison group (28.3 and 1.1%, respectively). No significant relationship was found with the duration of occupation. Among the seropositive subjects, it was found that most had been exposed to needle pricks or scissor cuts. Our data suggest that both HBV and HCV infections may constitute occupational hazards for barbers. The sources of infection could be not only such personal risk factors as 'sharps' injuries and scissor cuts, but may also include other unknown factors."

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of serologic markers for HBsAg and risk factors among blood donors from Chengdu, China. From April 2010 to March 2011, a total of 16,875 blood donors were enrolled. Data from HBsAg tests before and after donations were collected to estimate the prevalence of HBsAg. A case-control study was conducted in 265 unique HBsAg-positive blood donors and 530 seronegative donors between January 2011 and October 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. The population attributable risk (PAR) was estimated. The prevalence of HBsAg was 3.17% (95%CI, 2.91-3.43%). The following risk factors were associated with HBV infection: non-vaccination for HBV (OR = 4.236; 95%CI, 2.72-6.60%), razor sharing (OR = 2.370; 95%CI, 1.46-3.84%), dental treatment (OR = 1.714; 95%CI, 1.21-2.43%), acupuncture (OR = 1.983; 95%CI, 1.20-3.28%), a family history of HBV infection (OR = 2.257; 95%CI, 1.32-3.86%), and endoscopy (OR = 2.17; 95%CI, 1.04-4.51%). The PAR values of the risk factors were 42.77%, 31.78%, 13.68%, 6.18%, 6.09%, and 2.85%, respectively, and the total PAR was 68.78%. The prevalence of HBsAg among Chinese blood donors is still high. HBV vaccinations can provide protection. Blood contact from sharing instruments is still a high risk route of transmission for HBV.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this phenomenon reflects activation of the non-adaptive immune response in HIV infection. Fifty-one patients with HIV infection (42 men, nine women) were classified into two subgroups: those with HIV infection but without evidence of AIDS indicator conditions (HIV infected non-AIDS cases, n = 27) and those with AIDS (AIDS cases, n = 24). The activation of non-adaptive immune response was evaluated as the production of reactive oxygen species that cause lipid peroxidation, which was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) using the thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA). Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF), measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis, were used to show activation of endothelial cells even in the absence of any other causative agent, in these patients. TBARS levels in non-AIDS cases were significantly higher than in control subjects (n = 17) or AIDS cases (P < 0.001). The mean vWF levels were higher in AIDS cases than in non-AIDS cases or normal subjects (P < 0.05). TBARS levels remained significantly higher in non-AIDS cases after adjusting for age, CD4 T-cell and neutrophil counts, antiretroviral therapy and vWF plasma levels. The above findings indicate that in HIV infection, the virus per se is responsible for the increased oxidative stress that in turn activates various transduction pathways, may be leading to endothelial cell activation and shedding of adhesion molecules from the cell surface."

Prolonged activation and expansion of immunoregulatory cells have been thought to play a role. We determined immune cell subset frequency in contemporaneous liver and peripheral blood samples from chronic HCV-infected and HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and biopsy-derived liver-infiltrating lymphocytes from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 10 chronic HCV-infected and 10 HIV-infected individuals were assessed for various subsets of T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cell, natural killer (NK) cell and NK T-cell frequency by flow cytometry. CD8(+) T cells expressing the exhaustion marker PD-1 were increased in HCV-infected individuals compared with uninfected individuals (P = 0.02), and HIV coinfection enhanced this effect (P = 0.005). In the liver, regulatory CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T cells, as well as CD4(+) CD25(+) PD1(+) T cells, were more frequent in HIV/HCV-coinfected than in HCV-monoinfected samples (P < 0.001). HCV was associated with increased regulatory T cells, PD-1(+) T cells and decreased memory B cells, regardless of HIV infection (P ≤ 0.005 for all). Low CD8(+) expression was observed only in PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells from HCV-infected individuals and healthy controls (P = 0.002) and was associated with enhanced expansion of exhausted CD8(+) T cells when exposed in vitro to PHA or CMV peptides. In conclusion, in HIV/HCV coinfection, ongoing HCV replication is associated with increased regulatory and exhausted T cells in the periphery and liver that may impact control of HCV. Simultaneous characterization of liver and peripheral blood highlights the disproportionate intrahepatic compartmentalization of immunoregulatory T cells, which may contribute to establishment of chronicity and hepatic fibrogenesis in HIV coinfection."

We determined the prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis (defined by hepatic stiffness ≥9.5 kPa) and associated factors, focusing on the impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy and its major adverse effects (lipodystrophy and IR), in 671 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. One hundred ninety patients (28.3%) had advanced liver fibrosis. In univariate analysis, advanced liver fibrosis was significantly associated with male sex, higher body mass index, HCV infection through intravenous drug use, a lower absolute CD4 cell count, a longer history of antiretroviral treatment, longer durations of protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and NRTI exposure, lipodystrophy, diabetes, and a high homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA) value. The only antiretroviral drugs associated with advanced liver fibrosis were efavirenz, stavudine and didanosine. In multivariate analysis, male sex (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5; P = 0.018), HCV infection through intravenous drug use (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6; P = 0.018), lipodystrophy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P = 0.01), median didanosine exposure longer than 5 months (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.8; P = 0.04) and a high HOMA value (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.005) remained significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis. Mitochondrial toxicity and IR thus appear to play a key role in liver damage associated with HIV/HCV-coinfection, and this should be taken into account when selecting and optimizing antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral drugs with strong mitochondrial toxicity (e.g. didanosine) or a major effect on glucose metabolism should be avoided."

Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."

We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."

The frequencies of HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ PBL binding HLA-A2/HIV-epitope tetramers or producing IFN-gamma were below 1%. A panel of 16 CTL epitopes covering 15 HLA class I molecules in 14 patients allowed us to test 3.8 epitopes/patient and to detect 2.2 +/- 1.8 HIV epitope-specific CD8+ subsets per patient with a median frequency of 0.24% (0.11-4. 79%). During the first month of treatment, viral load rapidly decreased and frequencies of HIV-specific CD8 PBL tripled, eight new HIV specificities appeared of 11 undetectable at entry, while CMV-specific CD8+ PBL also appeared. With efficient HIV load control, all HIV specificities decayed involving a reduction of the CD8+CD27+CD11ahigh HIV-specific effector subset. Virus rebounds triggered by scheduled drug interruptions or transient therapeutic failures induced four patterns of epitope-specific CD8+ lymphocyte dynamics, i.e., peaks or disappearance of preexisting specificities, emergence of new specificities, or lack of changes. The HIV load rebounds mobilized both effector/memory HIV- and CMV-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Therefore, frequencies of virus-specific CD8 T cells appear to be positively correlated to HIV production in most cases during highly active antiretroviral therapy, but an inverse correlation can also be observed with rapid virus changes that might involve redistribution, sequestration, or expansion of these Ag-specific CD8 T cells. Future strategies of therapeutic interruptions should take into account these various HIV-specific cell dynamics during HIV rebounds."
8390,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."

A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."

Of the seven viral genotypes, genotype-1 virus infects humans and is a major public health concern in South Asian countries. Sporadic cases of genotype-3 and 4 infection in human and animals such as pigs, deer, mongeese have been reported primarily from industrialized countries. Genotype-5, 6 and 7 viruses are known to infect animals such as wild boar and camel, respectively. Genotype-3 and 4 viruses have been successfully propagated in the laboratory in mammalian cell culture. However, genotype-1 virus replicates poorly in mammalian cell culture and no other efficient model exists to study its life cycle. Here, we report that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes genotype-1 HEV replication by inducing cap-independent, internal initiation mediated translation of a novel viral protein (named ORF4). Importantly, ORF4 expression and stimulatory effect of ER stress inducers on viral replication is specific to genotype-1. ORF4 protein sequence is mostly conserved among genotype-1 HEV isolates and ORF4 specific antibodies were detected in genotype-1 HEV patient serum. ORF4 interacted with multiple viral and host proteins and assembled a protein complex consisting of viral helicase, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), X, host eEF1α1 (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 isoform-1) and tubulinβ. In association with eEF1α1, ORF4 stimulated viral RdRp activity. Furthermore, human hepatoma cells that stably express ORF4 or engineered proteasome resistant ORF4 mutant genome permitted enhanced viral replication. These findings reveal a positive role of ER stress in promoting genotype-1 HEV replication and pave the way towards development of an efficient model of the virus. "

There had been an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis B in a dialysis clinic in the western part of Honshu, Japan, that resulted in four deaths among six patients. After the sixth patient contracted severe hepatitis, all patients in the unit were screened biweekly for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to detect newly infected patients as soon as possible. Our patient was the seventh victim, and on the day he gave a positive result for HBsAg, his hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level had reached 1.1 x 10(11) copies/ml as assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of the causal HBV revealed the presence of a mutation in the precore region (nt 1896), two mutations in the core promoter (nt 1762 and nt 1764), and some minor mutations in the P gene that were restricted to the upstream region. These mutations are indicative of a virus with a high replicative rate that cannot secrete HBeAg. Taken together, these findings indicate that it is very likely that the replicative ability of the causal virus was as vigorous as that of HBV in hepatitis B e antigen-positive asymptomatic carriers with markedly high viral titers. The present case report provides clinical evidence of a possible association between the rapid spread of highly replicative HBV before host immunological recognition and the development of fulminant hepatitis."

Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."

We examined antiretroviral resistance among a cohort of 323 South African HIV-infected children <2 years old exposed to nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Ritonavir (RTV) was used initially for 138 children who were <6 months old or receiving antimycobacterial therapy; otherwise children received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based ART. HIV-1 population sequencing of the pol gene was conducted on all pretreatment samples and on posttreatment samples for children who did not achieve HIV-1 plasma RNA <400 copies/ml by 52 weeks. Among children in the cohort, 38 died, 22 had <24 weeks follow-up, 209 achieved virologic suppression, and 54 did not. Of 41 children without virologic suppression with posttreatment HIV genotype data available, major resistance mutations were found in 32 (78%): 14 (36%) had PI mutations including V82A, M46I, and L90M; 29 (71%) had M184V/I; and three had NNRTI mutations (K103N, Y181C, and G190A). Among the children who did not achieve virologic suppression, none of the seven children treated exclusively with LPV/r developed PI-related mutations, compared with 14 of 32 (44%) who received RTV-based regimens (p=0.036); PI genotypes were unavailable for two children. Seventy-eight percent of children without virologic suppression developed resistance mutations that impact second-line ART options. Only children who received RTV-based ART developed major PI-related resistance mutations, and use of this regimen should be avoided."

Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."

Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."

Thus, many complications and organic damage in the HIV-infected population emerge. Cardiovascular disease as coronary artery disease has become a matter of particular concern. Its incidence is greatly increased in the HIV-infected population over that of people of the same age in the absence of general cardiovascular risk factors. Despite several clinical and laboratory studies in the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, the pathogenic mechanisms of this significant clinical problem are largely unknown and are now under active investigation. Endothelial dysfunction is possibly the most plausible link between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. Increased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial adhesion molecule (E-selectin) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-6 has been reported in HIV-positive patients. The effect of HAART on endothelial function in HIV-positive patients is also demonstrated. In this review, we focus on the recent research update of HIV-associated vascular disease and vascular injury. We analyze and discuss the recent clinical and laboratory investigations on the effect of HIV, viral protein, and HAART therapy on endothelial injury and vascular disease; identify the areas of controversy and clinical relevance; and suggest some directions for future research."
9982,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) binding induces proapoptotic signals in CD4(+) T cells without a requirement of infection. Defective virus particles, which represent the majority of HIV-1, usually contain a functional Env and therefore represent a potentially significant cause of such CD4(+)-T-cell loss. We reasoned that an HIV-1 inhibitor that prohibits Env-host cell interactions could block the destructive effects of defective particles. HIV-1 attachment inhibitors (AIs), which potently inhibit Env-CD4 binding and subsequent downstream effects of Env, display low-nanomolar antiapoptotic potency and prevent CD4(+)-T-cell depletion from mixed lymphocyte cultures, also with low-nanomolar potency. Specific Env amino acid changes that confer resistance to AI antientry activity eliminate AI antiapoptotic effects. We observed that CD4(+)-T-cell destruction is specific for CXCR4-utilizing HIV-1 strains and that the fusion blocker enfuvirtide inhibits Env-mediated CD4(+)-T-cell killing but is substantially less potent than AIs. These observations, in conjunction with observed antiapoptotic activities of soluble CD4 and the CXCR4 blocker AMD3100, suggest that this AI activity functions through a mechanism common to AI antientry activity, e.g., prevention of Env conformation changes necessary for specific interactions with cellular factors that facilitate viral entry. Our study suggests that AIs, in addition to having potent antientry activity, could contribute to immune system homeostasis in individuals infected with HIV-1 that can engage CXCR4, thereby mitigating the increased risk of adverse clinical events observed in such individuals on current antiretroviral regimens."

As the prevalence of HIV infection continues to rise, health care practitioners in all geographic regions can expect greater clinical exposure to patients infected with HIV. We conducted an anonymous survey of all practicing otolaryngologists in Ohio and California to investigate regional differences in attitudes, knowledge, and practices regarding the care of patients infected with HIV. We also examined the data with respect to year of completion of residency training to identify differences in attitudes or practices among otolaryngologists who trained in the era of AIDS (post-1982 graduates) in comparison with their predecessors (pre-1982 graduates). In comparison with Ohio otolaryngologists, California otolaryngologists reported more frequent clinical encounters with HIV-infected patients and displayed significantly better knowledge regarding the otolaryngologic aspects of HIV infection. Californians were more likely to support the right of an HIV-infected physician to maintain an unrestricted practice and would be less likely to disclose their HIV status to their patients and hospital if they were to become infected with HIV. Post-1982 graduates had more frequent encounters with HIV-infected patients than did pre-1982 graduates and demonstrated a better fund of knowledge. Although Californians were more likely than Ohioans to routinely double glove in surgery, the overall double gloving rate was low at 21%. Californians were no more likely than Ohioans to routinely use protective eyewear, water-impervious gowns, or indirect instrument-passing techniques in surgery. No differences were observed in prevalence of protective surgical precautions between pre-1982 and post-1982 graduates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
8200,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant public health problem and one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Co-infection with HCV and HIV occurs frequently, mainly because both viruses share the same transmission routes. In recent years, the life expectancy of patients with HIV disease has been increased due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Furthermore, several studies have established that HIV infection is associated with a major progression of the HCV-related liver disease. Thus, end-stage liver disease has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population, emphasising the importance of treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-infected persons. The biological and histological benefit of interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) therapy in patients co-infected with HCV/HIV is not significantly different from that noted in similar patients without HIV when the HIV infection is adequately controlled. However, patients with low CD4+ cell counts tend to respond poorly to anti-HCV therapy.Given the relatively low sustained virological response rate to IFN alone, the use of IFNalpha monotherapy has been largely abandoned in favour of combination therapy with ribavirin. In the last 2 years, IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy has been the standard care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Although information on the safety and efficacy of this dual therapy in HCV/HIV co-infected patients is scarce, recent trials have reported that the combination of IFN plus ribavirin is well tolerated and feasible in patients co-infected with HCV/HIV. However, the rates of sustained virological response seem to be worse than those observed in patients without HIV infection. New IFN formulations (e.g. pegylated interferon) plus ribavirin appear to be way of the future for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients both with and without HIV co-infection."

Presence or absence of hepatitis viruses, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, CD4 cell count, and plasma HIV RNA levels were evaluated. Hepatotoxicity developed in a few study subjects without coinfection, whereas it was significantly higher in coinfected patients. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that viral hepatitis coinfections are independent risk factors for hepatotoxicity. After 6 months of treatment, ritonavir was associated with higher rates of severe hepatotoxicity in the coinfected group; in fact, ritonavir seems to be the most strongly hepatotoxic agent among coinfected patients. After 12 months of therapy, hepatotoxicity occurred more frequently in patients with hepatitis C virus who did not respond to antiretroviral therapy (ART), whereas patients who did respond to ART showed decreased ALT levels. Hepatotoxicity is not exclusively an effect of drug toxicity, and the presence of hepatitis coinfection is an independent risk factor. Moreover, chronic hepatotoxicity mainly occurs in patients who did not respond to therapy. Conversely, patients who did respond to ART seemed to show improvement of chronic liver infection."

Two matched HIV-1-positive/HTLV-2-negative controls for each coinfected individual were also enrolled in the study. HTLV-2 infection was found in 95 (8.2%) of the HIV-1-positive patients, 30 of whom were followed up for a median of 28.5 months. No significant differences were observed between them and the patients infected with HIV-1 alone in terms of the rate of decline in CD4 cell counts, progression to AIDS, or AIDS mortality, but they had an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-8.0; p =.009). One coinfected patient developed myelopathy during the follow-up. In the second part of the study, aimed at preliminarily assessing the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the incidence of peripheral neuropathy, we extended our observations to two groups of coinfected and singly infected individuals receiving HAART. An 80% decrease in incidence of peripheral neuropathy was observed among both groups without any significant difference between them. These results support the hypothesis that HTLV-2 plays a role in the development of neurologic abnormalities in HIV-1-infected patients and suggest that the immune reconstitution due to HAART may limit the activity of HTLV-2 as an opportunistic agent."

Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."

HBV serology was undertaken using subtype-specific antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigens. The HBV genotype was determined by sequencing directly the polymerase chain reaction products of the HBV S gene. When HCC occurred, patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization therapy. If tumor necrosis was incomplete, additional embolization therapy was carried out after a 3- to 4-month interval. At a median follow-up of 14.1 years (range 2.2 to 31.7), HCC occurred in 9 (35%) of 26 patients. Nineteen patients were infected with genotype B and 7 with genotype C. Four of the 19 genotype B patients (21%) and 5 of the 7 genotype C patients (71%) developed HCC (P = 0.058). Patient age (<45 years or 45 < or = ) at diagnosis of cirrhosis was the only significant independent factor influencing liver carcinogenesis by multiple logistic regression analysis and Cox's regression analysis (P = 0.0069 and 0.029, respectively). When analysis was limited to the age of 45 years or more at the last visit, genotype was the only contributory factor to HCC development by univariate analysis (P = 0.038). Whereas genotype B patients responded well to embolization therapy and had no recurrence of HCC for a prolonged period of time, genotype C patients showed poor responses and died of hepatic failure due to rapid HCC progression despite embolization therapy. The cumulative incidence of survival was significantly higher in the genotype B group (P = 0.0049). The HBV genotype correlated with the development of HCC, response to embolization therapy, and recurrence of HCC. Determination of HBV genotype may be useful in predicting outcomes in HBV subtype adw-related cirrhosis."

Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
7896,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"There is evidence that earlier initiation of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with better outcomes, including lower morbidity and mortality. Based on recent studies indicating that Medicaid enrollees are more likely to have suboptimal access to medical care, we hypothesized that HIV severity at time of ART initiation is worse for Medicaid patients than patients with other health care coverage. We conducted a US retrospective analysis of GE Centricity Outpatient Electronic Medical Records spanning 1 January 1997 through 30 September 2009. Subjects included all adult HIV patients initiating first-line ART who had CD4+ results within 90 days pre-initiation. HIV stage was defined using CD4 ranges: >500 (n=520), 351-500 (n=379), 201-350 (n=580), or ≤200 (n=406) cells/mm(3), with lower CD4 count being indicative of increased disease severity. Payer type was defined as the patient's primary payer: Medicaid, Medicare, commercial insurance, self-pay or other/unknown. After controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, cumulative logit models assessed the effect of payer type on HIV stage at ART initiation. The study included 1885 subjects with the primary payer being Medicaid (n=218), Medicare (n=330), commercial insurance (n=538), self-pay (n=159) or other/unknown (n=640). Final logit models demonstrated that, compared to patients on Medicaid, the odds of initiating ART at a higher CD4 range were significantly greater for those commercially insured (odds ratio [OR]=1.53; P=0.005), self-paying (OR=1.56; P=0.023) and other/unknown (OR=1.79; P<0.001) and similar for patients enrolled in Medicare (OR=1.11; P=0.521). Medicaid patients initiated ART at a more advanced stage of HIV than patients who were commercially insured, self-paying, or had other/unknown coverage. With HIV treatment guidelines now supporting ART initiation in patients with higher CD4 counts, these findings underscore the need for mitigating barriers, particularly in the Medicaid population, that may delay treatment initiation.

Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."

HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being widely introduced in public clinics, many HIV-infected persons still seek care via the private sector. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 at six public and private sites to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of ART among patients with HIV receiving care in India. Of 1667 persons surveyed, 609 (36%) had heard of ART and 19% of these persons reported that ART could cure HIV. Twenty-four percent reported that they were currently taking ART, with 18% of these patients not actually on ART according to their provider. Major barriers to taking ART were cost (33%), lack of knowledge of ART (41%), and deferral by physician (30%). More than half of all public and private patients had not heard of CD4 (57%) or viral load testing (80%), and even fewer had received these tests (32% and 11%, respectively). Private clinic attendees were almost 4 times more likely to be on ART (35% versus 9%, p < 0.0001), more likely to be male, have a higher education, be partnered, have a higher income, and have had a CD4 or viral load (p < 0.0001). Overall, low levels of ART knowledge and access were observed among HIV infected patients, with access to ART being particularly low among patients attending public clinics. In order to make widespread dissemination of ART effective in India, further educational and programmatic efforts are likely needed to optimize access, treatment awareness, and compliance among patients with HIV."

Hepatitis C coinfection increased the risk of death in the HIV+ group (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.10 - 2.85). The probability of kidney transplantation in HIV+ was only 17% after 7 years, comparing with total RTT patients (HR 0.15; 95% CI: 0.10-0.24). Despite the use of HAART, the incidence of HIV+ patients on dialysis has increased; their mortality still exceeds non-HIV patients, and they have a very low rate of transplantation. It is necessary to further our knowledge of this disease in order to improve results. "

However, the ageing of patients leads to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Various studies have found that pharmaceutical care results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To measure the impact of pharmaceutical care on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Setting Outpatient pharmacy service of a tertiary hospital, Spain. Methods A pre/post-intervention quasi-experimental clinical study was conducted in which health education and pharmacist interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors were carried out in a single patient cohort using the Dader method of pharmacotherapy, with a 12-month follow-up period per patient. Patients included were older than 50 years, with moderate/elevated cardiovascular risk. Data were obtained from patient clinical histories, dispensing records and patient interviews, and were subjected to statistical analysis. Main outcome measure Cardiovascular risk estimated by SCORE and REGICOR equations. Results Forty-two patients completed the study. Of these, 93 % were men, with an average age of 57 years and 15 years since diagnosis of HIV. A reduction was observed in the mean values (baseline vs. 12 months) of the following cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure (P = 0.009), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010), total cholesterol (P = 0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; P = 0.039), triglycerides (P = 0.010) and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c; P < 0.001). An increase in HDL-c (P = 0.037) was also observed. The average cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE instrument was reduced from 7.6 % at the beginning of the study to 6.4 % after 12 months (P = 0.039). The risk estimate according to REGICOR also decreased (P = 0.002). Over the 12-month period, 6.3 ± 3.4 interventions were carried out per patient. Quantitative ineffectiveness was the most prevalent negative outcome associated with medication throughout the study, and noncompliance was the most frequent cause. Interventions on health education were the most common, followed by interventions on improving adherence. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care, delivered as a combination of health education and pharmacotherapy follow-up to outpatients at a tertiary hospital, had a positive impact on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy."

With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."

Clinical and neuropsychological data were obtained on 291 HIV+ homosexual men seen semi-annually over a nine year period (1986-1994). A proportional hazards model was used to assess the predictive value of sustained psychomotor slowing (defined as a 2.0 standard deviation (s.d.) decline in performance on either the Symbol Digit Modalities test or Trailmaking test at two consecutive evaluations). Time-dependent co-variates included in the model were sustained psychomotor slowing, number of attended visits, CD4+ lymphocyte count, hemoglobin and antiretroviral medication use. HIV+ participants with and without sustained psychomotor slowing were compared. Outcome variables were the development of dementia, AIDS and death. HIV+ subjects with sustained psychomotor slowing had an increased hazard of dementia (Risk ratio (RR) = 5.0, P = 0.008), AIDS (RR = 2.4, P = 0.02), and death (RR = 2.0, P = 0.04). A similar analysis using sustained cognitive decline in one domain from a more extensive neuropsychological test battery failed to show any predictive value. Sustained decline in psychomotor performance in HIV infection was predictive of dementia, AIDS and death. This brief neuropsychological test battery may be useful for early detection of HIV+ individuals with a poorer prognosis who may benefit from more aggressive treatment to prevent HIV dementia."

Both infections often remain undiagnosed in resource-limited settings because routine testing is not a part of most of the national guidelines. Epidemiological studies provide important information on prevalence and risk factors for such co-infections and can provide guidance for clinical management and for the development of test strategies. We analysed data on baseline characteristics, CD4 cell counts, HBV and syphilis co-infection rates of 690 patients enrolling for antiretroviral therapy in rural Cameroon. The prevalence of both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg, 12.6%, 95% CI 10.1-15.1) and treponemal antibodies (11.4%, 95% CI 8.9-13.7) was high, with significantly higher prevalences for both infections in men; detection of treponemal antibodies increased with age. Although liver enzyme elevations were common, they were not useful to identify HBsAg-positive patients. In this setting, routine serological screening for HBV and syphilis co-infection should be considered to avoid complications and ongoing transmission."
5927,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Early diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) improves health outcomes and prevents HIV transmission. Before 2010, HIV testing was available to inmates in the California state prison system upon request. In 2010, the California Correctional Health Care Services (CCHCS) integrated HIV opt-out screening into the health assessment for inmates entering California state prisons. Under this system, a medical care provider informs the inmate that an HIV test is routinely done, along with screening for sexually transmitted, communicable, and vaccine-preventable diseases, unless the inmate specifically declines the test. During 2012-2013, CCHCS, the California Department of Public Health, and CDC evaluated HIV screening, rates of new diagnoses, linkage to and retention in care, ART response, and post-release linkage to care among California prison inmates. All prison inmates are processed through one of eight specialized reception center facilities, where they undergo a comprehensive evaluation of their medical needs, mental health, and custody requirements for placement in one of 35 state prisons. Among 17,436 inmates who entered a reception center during April-September 2012, 77% were screened for HIV infection; 135 (1%) tested positive, including 10 (0.1%) with newly diagnosed infections. Among the 135 HIV-positive patient-inmates, 134 (99%) were linked to care within 90 days of diagnosis, including 122 (91%) who initiated ART. Among 83 who initiated ART and remained incarcerated through July 2013, 81 (98%) continued ART; 71 (88%) achieved viral suppression (<200 HIV RNA copies/mL). Thirty-nine patient-inmates were released on ART; 12 of 14 who were linked to care within 30 days of release were virally suppressed at that time. Only one of nine persons with a viral load test conducted between 91 days and 1 year post-release had viral suppression. Although high rates of viral suppression were achieved in prison, continuity of care in the community remains a challenge. An infrastructure for post-release linkage to care is needed to help ensure sustained HIV disease control."

We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."

Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
1916,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Entecavir (ETV) is a potent antiviral nucleoside analogue that is used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ETV is also active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase RT) inhibitors (NRTIs), ETV contains a 3'-hydroxyl group that allows further nucleotide incorporation events to occur. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition probably differs from classic chain termination. Here, we show that the incorporated ETV-monophosphate (MP) can interfere with three distinct stages of DNA synthesis. First, incorporation of the next nucleotide at position n + 1 following ETV-MP is compromised, although DNA synthesis eventually continues. Second, strong pausing at position n + 3 suggests a long range effect, referred to as ""delayed chain-termination."" Third, the incorporated ETV-MP can also act as a ""base pair confounder"" during synthesis of the second DNA strand, when the RT enzyme needs to pass the inhibitor in the template. Enzyme kinetics revealed that delayed chain termination is the dominant mechanism of action. High resolution foot-printing experiments suggest that the incorporated ETV-MP ""repels"" the 3'-end of the primer from the active site of HIV-1 RT, which, in turn, diminishes incorporation of the natural nucleotide substrate at position n + 4. Most importantly, delayed chain termination protects ETV-MP from phosphorolytic excision, which represents a major resistance mechanism for approved NRTIs. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale and important tools for the development of novel, more potent delayed chain terminators as anti-HIV agents."

The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."

A retrospective review was performed of charts of currently active HIV-infected adult patients in the Family Model Clinic (FMC) of the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence (BCOE) in Gaborone, Botswana, for the results of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antihepatitis C IgG tests performed between January 1, 2005 and December 15, 2009. Of 308 active FMC patients, 266 underwent HBsAg serology testing within the period of study. The HBsAg coinfection prevalence was 5.3% (14/266); 2 of 252 patients had at least one positive antihepatitis C IgG serology, a 0.8% prevalence. Hepatitis B coinfection is relatively common in HIV-infected adults at our center in Botswana, whereas hepatitis C coinfection is rare. In this setting, where the diagnosis of hepatitis B coinfection with HIV has implications for choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy and prevention of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, broader sampling to establish the true population prevalence of hepatitis B coinfection and the desirability of adding screening to HIV management should be considered. These findings provide little justification for adding hepatitis C coinfection screening to the management of HIV infection in Botswana."
306,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Cellular immune responses during acute Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infection are a known correlate of infection outcome. Viral adaptation to these responses via mutation(s) within CD8+ T-cell epitopes allows these viruses to subvert host immune control. This study examined HCV evolution in 21 HCV genotype 1-infected subjects to characterise the level of viral adaptation during acute and early HCV infection. Of the total mutations observed 25% were within described CD8+ T-cell epitopes or at viral adaptation sites. Most mutations were maintained into the chronic phase of HCV infection (75%). The lack of reversion of adaptations and high proportion of silent substitutions suggests that HCV has structural and functional limitations that constrain evolution. These results were compared to the pattern of viral evolution observed in 98 subjects during a similar phase in HIV infection from a previous study. In contrast to HCV, evolution during acute HIV infection is marked by high levels of amino acid change relative to silent substitutions, including a higher proportion of adaptations, likely reflecting strong and continued CD8+ T-cell pressure combined with greater plasticity of the virus. Understanding viral escape dynamics for these two viruses is important for effective T cell vaccine design."

HBV DNA and HBV genotypic resistance test were performed. Patients were categorized into two groups: with and without HBV-DR. There were 84 patients with a mean age (standard deviation [SD]) of 42.2 (10.2) years and 77% were males. Median (range) duration of ART and lamivudine use was 46 (3-177) and 40 (3-140) months, respectively. Median (range) CD4 cell count was 352 (49-790) cells/mm(3). Of all, 19 (23%) had HBV-DR with a median (range) HBV DNA of 2.56 x 10(7) (2.54 x 10(3)-11 x 10(7)) IU/mL. In univariate analysis, there were no differences in age, gender, ART regimen, liver function test, anti-HBc antibody, anti-HCV antibody between the two groups. Patients with HBV-DR had a higher proportion of positive HBeAg (68.4% versus 3.8%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, positive HBeAg (odds ratio [OR) 16.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.31-83.60] and duration of lamivudine use [per 6-month increment, OR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36] were significant risk factors for HBV-DR. All 19 patients with HBV-DR had lamivudine resistance with the mutations as follows: M204V/I (95%), L180M/A181T (95%), L80V/I (47%), V173L (32%), and N236T (21%). Of these, 95%, 84%, 84%, and 0% of patients had HBV-DR to telbivudine, entecavir, adefovir, and tenofovir, respectively. HBV-DR is common in HBV/HIV-1 coinfected patients receiving lamivudine-containing ART without tenofovir. Positive HBeAg and longer duration of lamivudine use are risk factors for HBV-DR.

We estimated the prevalence of HIV, and identified viral subtypes and risk factors among FSWs. A cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method was conducted among 402 FSWs in Campo Grande city, Brazil, from 2009 to 2011. Participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire about sociodemograpic characteristics and risk behavior. Blood samples were collected for serological testing of HIV. Of the 402 FSWs, median age and age of initiating sex work were 25 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 9) and 20 years (IQR: 6), respectively. The majority reported use of alcohol (88.5%), had 5-9 years (median: 9; IQR: 3) of schooling (54.5%), 68.6% had tattoos/body piercings, and 45.1% had more than seven clients per week (median: 7; IQR: 10). Only 32.9% of FSW reported using a condom with nonpaying partners in the last sexual contact. Prevalence of HIV infection was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). Genotyping for HIV-1 performed on three samples detected subtypes B, C, and F1. Sex work in the Midwestern region of Brazil is characterized by reduced education, large numbers of clients per week, and inconsistent condom use, mainly with nonpaying partners. Although prevalence of HIV infection is currently low, elevated levels of high-risk sexual behavior confirm a need to implement prevention measures. Specific interventions targeting FSWs must emphasize the risk associated with both clients and nonpaying partners while providing knowledge about HIV prevention. "

Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
6638,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are strong and independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are considered at risk of developing cancer. However, the interaction between HFE gene mutations and hepatitis viruses for HCC development has not been systematically searched for. To assess the interaction between HFE gene mutations and exogenous risk factors in the risk of HCC occurrence, a case-only approach, in which just a series of patients is enrolled, was used. Three hundred three cirrhotic patients (231 males, 72 females) from five liver units in different geographic areas of Italy, who developed HCC during regular follow-up between January 1999 and March 2003, and whose blood DNA was available, were analyzed. In all subjects, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV and HFE gene mutations were assayed; alcohol intake was recorded by history. The interaction between HFE genotypes and hepatitis viruses for HCC was estimated by multivariate analysis adjusting for the confounding effect of alcohol intake, area of residence and months of follow-up. Of the 303 HCC cases, 12 (4.0%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, 93 (30.7%) for the H63D, and 198 (65.3%) homozygous for the wild allele. Multivariate analysis showed that C282Y heterozygous males were 3.8-fold (95% CI=1.0-15.2) more likely to be HBV positive and that H63D heterozygous females were 6.0-fold (95% CI=1.2-113.8) more likely to be HCV positive than wild type subjects. In conclusion, given the association between C282Y mutation and HBV infection in male patients with HCC, a careful evaluation and follow-up should be considered in the C282Y-positive subjects with hepatitis B virus related liver disease. The interaction between the H63D mutation and HCV, observed only in women, may reflect a higher sensitivity to H63D-induced iron metabolism abnormalities and a reduced antioxidant capability in the presence of an even minor increase of iron which may occur as a consequence of the coexistence of hepatitis C infection and heterozygosity for HH."

Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."

Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
462,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"A direct causal association between hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the development of nephropathy remains controversial. Epidemiological studies have shown that chronic carriage of HBV in some individuals (particularly children) leads to the development of nephrotic syndrome with a strong male predominance, the commonest histological type being membranous nephropathy (MN). Spontaneous clearance of HBV antigens (particularly the HBeAg) leads to abrogation of proteinuria. The isolation of immune complexes in the kidney suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease may have an immune-complex basis. Recent studies showing expression of HBV viral antigens in kidney tissue suggest direct viral-induced pathological alterations and chronic immunologic injury. Biosocial studies have detected no correlation between HBV carriage and proteinuria using both quantitative and qualitative urinary protein analysis. Genetic studies of HLA class I and II genes showed a predisposition to MN but no similar correlation in those with milder degrees of proteinuria. These findings suggest that milder proteinuria is unrelated to HBV carriage or genetic factors but the development of nephropathy, particularly MN, in patients with chronic HBV carriage (HBsAg and/or HBV DNA positive) is based on an interaction of virus and host factors. Although the natural history of the disease tends to remission with preservation of renal function, there is considerable morbidity and a small but significant mortality. Use of naturally occurring cytokines (such as interferon-alpha2b) and other candidate therapies accelerates clearance of the virus and proteinuria. The most effective tool in reducing the incidence of the disease is the use of HBV vaccines."

In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."

In 2003, a face-to-face survey was conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) selected in a random, stratified sample of French hospital departments. Among solicited individuals, 2,932 agreed to participate and were asked if they had ever AS. Among the respondents, 23% had AS. Female gender, younger age, native French citizenship, reporting household financial difficulties, having been HIV-contaminated through homosexual contact or through injection drug use and suffering from lipodystrophy-related symptoms were all independently associated with AS. HIV-discrimination and the lack of social support from family remained independently associated with AS. Our findings indicate a high level of AS among PLWHA and emphasize the multiple roles of factors associated with living with HIV, together with sociodemographic factors. The results enable the possibility for vulnerable groups to be targeted for specific future interventions in order to prevent attempted suicide."
53,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Recent analysis of antiretroviral treatment (ART) program data in Georgia showed that end-stage liver disease was a leading cause of death among HIV/HCV co infected patients in 2005. The objective of this retrospective study was to study prevailing genotypes and subtypes of HCV virus in a cohort of HIV infected patients. The investigation revealed that of 1490 patients, 879 (59%) were hepatitis C antibody positive. Detectable HCV RNA was found among 91% of patients. Median liver HCV RNA level was higher than among mono-infected patients. The most prevalent genotypes were genotype 1 (41.6%), followed by genotype 3 (34.7%) and genotype 2 (17.6%), inter (mix) genotype recombinants were found among 5.8 % of patients. The genotype distribution in our study is slightly different from what was seen in Georgia in 2000. The differences of prevailing HCV genotypes among general population and HIV co infected group was probably attributed to the different methods for sample selection used within our study or possible influence of diverse transmission networks among HIV infected group. Another explanation can be the possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the result of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Our study demonstrated high prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected patients and revealed 1b as predominant genotype. IDUs were less likely to spontaneously clear the virus than homosexual man and heterosexually infected woman. A greater HCV RNA levels were associated with a greater chance to be infected with HCV genotypes 1. Possible shift from predominance of genotype 1 to non 1 genotypes can be of option. This shift may have a major and beneficial impact on treatment schedules and costs. The higher number intergenotype recombinant forms might be the results of continues parenteral exposure to different HCV genotypes during drug injection paraphernalia. Study results highlights and strengthens the need for careful follow-up of HCV/HIV co infected patients, effective management and therapies against HCV in order to reduce liver related death rates in patients on ART."

Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
3205,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"The factors determining the responsiveness of different hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes to interferon treatment are not fully understood. We investigated the relationship between HBV genetic characteristics and the outcome of short (16 weeks) or prolonged (32 weeks) treatment with standard interferon-alpha in a prospectively followed cohort of 103 patients across Europe with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. INNO-LiPA assays and HBV DNA sequencing were used to determine HBV genotypes, mutations in the core promoter and precore/core regions. After 16-weeks interferon-alpha treatment, the rate of HBeAg clearance was higher in genotype A versus all other genotypes (P = 0.014), or genotype D alone (P = 0.05). The HBV genome analysis revealed that: (i) after 16-weeks treatment, an HBV subpopulation with core promoter mutations emerged or increased (P < 0.001) only in genotype A; (ii) the core gene of genotype A has the lowest number of amino acid variations in comparison with genotypes B, C, or D. Logistic regression analysis identified genotype A as a positive predictor of short (16 weeks) treatment response (P = 0.001; odds ratio 6.19, 95 confidence interval 1.94-19.8), having a greater impact than baseline HBV DNA or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In contrast, the response to prolonged interferon-alpha treatment was not different between HBV genotypes. These results suggest that HBV genotype A responds earlier to interferon treatment than other genotypes, which is associated with its molecular characteristics. The optimal duration of interferon-based therapies in chronic hepatitis B may vary between different HBV genotypes."
7144,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance. While great progress has been made in treating hepatitis B, many important issues require further study."

Consequently, HIV is now considered a chronic disease, one that affects nearly 40 million people worldwide. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), first instituted in 1996, has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of perinatally infected children; however, in 2004, there were still 640,000 children under the age of 15 living with HIV worldwide.1 This population of patients faces more mature health issues compared to most children their age. For example, rampant dental decay is common among children with HIV and requires advanced treatment planning that needs to be closely coordinated with members of the medical team. Maintaining good oral health in combination with medication compliance leads to sustained overall health in HIV-infected children; however, many of the medications these children take have severe adverse effects on their oral health. Furthermore, these medications may interfere with other medications that are prescribed or administered in connection with oral health care. Lastly, the systemic and oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS are different for children than they are for adults; as a result, the prognosis and treatment options for these manifestations vary, depending on the patient's age. This article will address factors that affect the oral health of HIV-infected children and adults, as well as common oral manifestations of HIV and AIDS. Key differences in treatment planning for HIV-infected children and HIV-infected adults will be outlined."

Serum levels were monitored for a 1-year period in 25 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) who were naive for HAART at the initiation of the study, and in four HIV-1-infected long-term non-progressors. Serum levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII at baseline were significantly higher in HIV-1-infected patients than in controls. Baseline levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII were not significantly different in long-term non-progressors compared with the other patients. HCV co-infected patients had significantly higher levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII at each time-point compared with patients who were not co-infected with HCV. Irrespective of HCV status, response to HAART resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of both IL-18 and sTNFRII, particularly among patients who achieved HIV viral suppression, but the net decrease observed at the end of follow-up was lower in patients co-infected with HCV. No information was obtained from IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 (p70) measurements. The data suggest that analysis of serum levels of IL-18 and sTNFRII may be a valuable tool for evaluating the response to HAART, and perhaps for assessing the degree of immune restoration achieved by HAART responders. The results also highlight the relevance of considering the HCV infection status of HIV-1-infected patients in order to avoid misinterpretation of IL-18 and sTNFRII measurements."

The 27 individuals were antiretroviral naive with CD4(+) T-cell counts of >500 cells/ microl for more than 8 years after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Effector CTL activity was determined using a standard ex vivo chromium release assay. Individuals with CTL activity (HIV-1 env(IIIB) or pol or gag) were then compared to those without CTL activity in relation to plasma HIV-1 RNA, ICD p24 antigen, beta(2)-microglobulin, CD4 and CD8 T-cell counts, CCR5 and CCR2b genotypes, and progression to CD4 <500 cells/microl or commencement of antiretroviral treatment. Of the 27 individuals examined, 19 had no detectable effector CTL activity. The eight individuals with detectable CTL activity had significantly higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA (P = 0.014), immune complex dissociated p24 antigen (P = 0.006), and beta(2)-microglobulin (P = 0.009). There was increased risk of progression within 4 years of study entry in individuals with detectable effector CTL activity, higher plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA, higher beta(2)-microglobulin levels, and higher immune complex dissociated p24 antigen levels at enrollment (P = 0.017, P = 0.004, P = 0.027, P = 0.008 respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated viral load remained the strongest predictor of disease progression within this group (P = 0.017). There were no significant associations between CTL response and chemokine receptor genotype. These findings demonstrate the importance of HIV replication in generating an effector CTL response and show that effector CTL activity may be an early predictor of progression in people with long-term asymptomatic HIV infection."

They were also interviewed with regard to their past history of blood transfusion, vaccination against HBV, liver diseases and repeated skin piercing treatments such as tattooing, acupuncture and intravenous drug use. Sera from 300 female blood donors (aged 20 s-40 s), of the same district, collected during the same year, were assessed for comparison. Incidence of seropositives for anti-HCV and anti-TP were found to be significantly high in the prostitute group (11.0% and 16.2%, respectively) compared to the control (0% for both). Anti-HBV seropositives were 14.1% in the prostitute group and 12.7% in the control group without significant difference and none of our subjects were found to be anti-HIV positive. Among HCV infected only 5 experienced repeated skin-piercing treatment and none underwent blood transfusion. From these results it is concluded that HCV has a potential for being transmitted by heterosexual contact, although the exact risk for infection needs to be determined by further investigation."

The aim of this work was to assess the fibrosis progression rate in HIV-HCV coinfected patients and in patients infected by HCV only. A cohort of 122 HIV-HCV coinfected patients was compared with a control group of 122 HIV-negative HCV-infected patients. Groups were matched according to age, sex, daily alcohol consumption, age at HCV infection, and duration and route of HCV infection. The fibrosis progression rate was defined as the ratio between fibrosis stage (METAVIR scoring system) and the HCV duration. The prevalence of extensive liver fibrosis (METAVIR fibrosis scores 2, 3, and 4) and moderate or severe activity were higher in HIV-infected patients (60% and 54%, respectively) than in control patients (47% and 30%, respectively; P <.05 and P <.001, respectively). The median fibrosis progression rate in coinfected patients and in control patients was 0.153 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.117-0.181) and 0.106 (95% CI, 0.084-0.125) fibrosis units per year, respectively (P <.0001). HIV seropositivity (P <.0001), alcohol consumption (>50 g/d, P =.0002), age at HCV infection (<25 years old, P <.0001), and severe immunosuppression (CD4 count </=200 cells/microL, P <.0001) were associated with an increase in the fibrosis progression rate. In coinfected patients, alcohol consumption (>50 g/d), CD4 count (</=200 cells/microL), and age at HCV infection (<25 years old) (P <. 0001, respectively) were associated with a higher fibrosis progression rate. HIV seropositivity accelerates HCV-related liver fibrosis progression. In coinfected patients, a low CD4 count, alcohol consumption rate, and age at HCV infection are associated with a higher liver fibrosis progression rate."

Potent anti-HBV therapy is available and can be used to improve outcomes by suppressing HBV DNA. Many HBV agents have dual activity with HIV and may be used to treat both diseases. However, care must be taken when using HBV nucleos(t)ides that have not been fully studied in the HIV-infected population because the emergence of strains resistant to HIV treatment has been reported. Careful monitoring of response to treatment is needed when treating an HIV/HBV patient with severe immune suppression.

2295,0.0033333333333333335,2.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of HBV coinfection in a large U.S. population of HCV patients. We used the National Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry to identify patients tested for HCV during 1997-2005. Patients were categorized based on HCV exposure (any two +HCV tests or one test with a diagnostic code), HCV infection (+RNA or genotype), HBV exposure (any +HBV test, excluding +HBsAb only), and HBV infection (+HBsAg, HBV DNA, or HBeAg). The prevalence of HBV exposure among patients with HCV exposure and that of HBV infection among patients with HCV infection were determined. Multivariate logistic regression evaluated potential demographic and clinical predictors of HBV coinfection. Among 168,239 patients with HCV exposure, 58,415 patients had HBV exposure for a prevalence of 34.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.5-35.0). Among 102,971 patients with HCV infection, 1,431 patients had HBV coinfection for a prevalence of 1.4% (95% CI 1.3-1.5). Independent associations with HBV coinfection compared with HCV monoinfection were age ≤ 50 years, male sex, positive HIV status, history of hemophilia, sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, history of blood transfusion, cocaine and other drug use; there was decreased risk in patients of Hispanic ethnicity."

Previous studies in wealthy nations have found that experiencing severe traumas can cause elevated levels of anxiety, but few studies have examined this association in non-disaster situations in less wealthy nations. Trauma and trauma-related anxiety are associated with greater sexual risk taking behaviours, lower HIV medication adherence levels and poorer health outcomes in wealthy nations. The objectives of this manuscript are: (1) to compare rates of trauma in two HIV-positive samples from areas that have not experienced disaster situations that are recognized by the international community as traumatic events; and (2) to examine whether the reported traumatic experiences are similarly associated with self-reported mental and physical health. The samples come from a region of a wealthy nation that consistently experiences large increases in incident AIDS cases and where the epidemic is largely transmitted heterosexually (Deep South, United States; n =611) and a region in a less wealthy nation with relatively high HIV prevalence and incidence rates and where transmission is also primarily heterosexual (Moshi, Tanzania; n =72). Compared to the US sample, the Tanzanian sample reported significantly higher rates of trauma in the areas of illness, injury, accidents and ""other"" significant traumas, a higher prevalence of anxiety and poorer physical health. The experience of trauma was similarly associated with greater mental health symptomatology and poorer physical health in both samples. Further investigation into the area of trauma and its sequelae is warranted, particularly in relation to risk behaviours and HIV medication adherence. At a time of increasing anti-retroviral therapy (ART) availability in less wealthy nations, additional focus on trauma care could improve ART adherence rates and reduce risk behaviors, thereby assisting in stemming the further spread of the epidemic."

To characterize the potential impact of CAM use on HIV care, we conducted a systematic review of 40 studies of CAM use among HIV-positive people. The goals of this review are to: (1) describe the demographic, biomedical, psychosocial and health behavior correlates of CAM use; (2) characterize patient-reported reasons for CAM use; and (3) identify methodological and conceptual limitations of the reviewed studies. Findings confirm that a high proportion of HIV-positive individuals report CAM use (M=60%). Overall, CAM use is more common among HIV-positive individuals who are men who have sex with men (MSM), non-minority, better educated and less impoverished. The use of CAM is also associated with greater HIV-symptom severity and longer disease duration. HIV-positive CAM users commonly report that they use CAM to prevent or alleviate HIV-related symptoms, reduce treatment side-effects and improve quality of life. Findings regarding the association between CAM use, psychosocial adjustment and adherence to conventional HIV medications are mixed. While the reviewed studies are instrumental in describing the characteristics of HIV-positive CAM users, this literature lacks a conceptual framework to identify causal factors involved in the decision to use CAM or explain implications of CAM use for conventional HIV care. To address this concern, we propose the use of health behavior theory and discuss implications of review findings for HIV care providers."

This cross-sectional study presents data from a reference HIV-outpatient service in Dourados (Brazil) that evaluated the association between depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, and clinical, socioeconomic, and demographic factors in newly diagnosed HIV/AIDS patients. Using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 61% with a predominance of self-deprecating and cognitive-affective factors. Depressive symptoms were associated with lower income (p=0.019) and disadvantaged social class (p=0.005). Poorer quality of life was related to depressive symptoms (p<0.0001), low educational level (p=0.05), and lower income (p=0.03). These data suggest that socioeconomic factors, including level of income and education, are mediating the risk of depression and poor quality of life of PLHIV. Possible explanations for this effect are discussed, including the possible role of stigma."

It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."

The basis for these guidelines were the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines from April 2017. According to qualified estimates, there are 240 million people with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection worldwide. The Czech Republic is among the countries with a low prevalence of HBV infection. According to the latest seroprevalence study, 0.56 % of the Czech citizens were chronically infected with HBV in 2001. A similar study conducted in only two regions of the Czech Republic in 2013 showed a prevalence of only 0.064 %. HBV infection can lead to serious life-threatening liver damage - fulminant hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The main goals of treatment are to prolong the length of life and improve its quality by preventing the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis, cirrhosis decompensation and development of HCC. The goals may be achieved if HBV replication is suppressed in a sustained manner. Additional goals are prevention of vertical transmission from mother to newborn, inhibition of HBV reactivation and therapy of HBV-related extrahepatic manifestations. Generally, there are two different strategies of chronic hepatitis B therapy available - treatment with nucleoside or nucleotide inhibitors (NIs) or with pegylated interferon alfa. Currently, the vast majority of Czech and European patients are treated with NIs. The NIs that have been approved for HBV treatment in the European Union include lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir (ETV), telbivudin (TBV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). TAF and TBV have not yet been marketed in the Czech Republic. The main advantages of treatment with potent NIs with a high barrier to resistance (ETV, TDF, TAF) are their predictable high long-term antiviral efficacy leading to undetectable HBV DNA levels in the vast majority of compliant patients as well as their favorable safety profiles. These drugs can be used in any HBV infected patient and represent the only treatment option for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplants, extrahepatic HBV-related manifestations, severe acute hepatitis B or chronic HBV reactivation."

Fourteen untreated and 2 treated patients experienced clinical progression (p = 0.09). The difference between baseline CD4 T-cell count and after 3 years, was -240/mm3 in the untreated group +19/mm3 in the HAART group (p < 10(-3)). A better immunological outcome was significantly associated with a HIV sexual contamination (p = 0.01), HAART (p = 0.01), high baseline CD4 T-cell count (p < 10(-3)) and low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.01). In the HAART group, the incidence rate of antiretroviral modification due to tolerance difficulties was 0.23+/-0.36/patient year. A sustained undetectable HIV viral load was correlated with a low baseline HIV viral load (p = 0.003) and to be antiretroviral naive (p < 10(-3)). Thus, HAART provide a better immunological outcome in patients with high CD4 T-cell count. However, the CD4 decay slope after 3 years, the risk of therapeutic side-effects and the low risk of clinical progression do not support systematic treatment of those patients."

One hundred forty-one patients with undetectable viral load for at least 6 months and CD4+ T cells count greater than 500 per microliter were recruited. Their antiretroviral therapy was stopped and clinical, analytic, virologic, and immunologic data were recorded at baseline, during discontinuation, and after restarting treatment. Viral load rebound after discontinuation in 137 (97%) patients, and was similar to prehighly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) levels. A rapid decrease in CD4+ T-cell count (median, 240 cells per microliter), was observed in the first 3 months in all patients, with pronounced differences between them. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 45.5% patients were still without therapy. Factors related to a more severe decline were a prior lower CD4+ T nadir (<200 cells per microliter) before starting HAART, a greater increase (>500 cells per microliter) with it, a higher CD4+ T-cell count before interruption (>800 cells per microliter) and a higher viral load rebound after it. The increase in CD4+ T-cell counts after reinitiation was slower than the decline and only 55% of patients have regained the preinterruption levels at 12 months of follow- up. Twelve infectious events were registered. Treatment failure related to drug resistance was observed in two patients. Planned treatment interruptions may be safe in selected patients with previous CD4+ T cell nadir greater than 200 cells per microliter and pre-HAART VL less than 55.000 copies per milliliter, but should be not recommended in patients with the prognostic factors related to a rapid decline described in this study. Furthermore, there is a considerable concern about the development of drug resistance and the possibility of an incomplete immune reconstitution after the treatment interruption in some patients."

The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."

A total of 2636 patients (71%) had DVS, 387 (10%) had low viral rebound, and 713 (19%) had high viral rebound. Factors associated with DVS were antiretroviral-naive status, choice of PI (indinavir or boosted PI), lower virus load and higher CD4+ cell count, shorter duration of therapy (<6 months), and larger CD4+ cell increment until an undetectable virus load was attained. These factors (except for receipt of indinavir) were also associated with low versus high viral rebound. Compared with patients with DVS, patients with high viral rebound were more likely to experience clinical failure (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-3.02) and immunologic failure (aHR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.34-1.83), and patients with low viral rebound were as likely to experience these types of failure (aHR for clinical failure, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.48-2.92]; aHR for immunologic failure, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87-1.32]), suggesting that a low viral rebound while receiving HAART that contains a PI has no significant consequence on midterm clinical outcome."

We evaluated the association of HIV disease progression with body mass index (BMI) in 871 women and present cross-sectional, survival, and longitudinal analyses. A higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower rate of occurrence of the first CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3). In analyses that incorporated time-varying BMI, underweight and normal women had an increased risk of clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and underweight women had increased risk of HIV-related death, compared with obese women. The association between change in BMI and CD4 cell count was estimated; increases in BMI were associated with slight increases in CD4 cell counts, even after controlling for prior values of CD4 cell count, viral load, and treatment. Higher BMI and increases in BMI are associated with a decreased risk of HIV progression."
427,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Enfuvirtide (T-20) is the first approved HIV-1 entry into cells' inhibitor. It is a peptide with an amino acid sequence analogue to HR2 region of the viral surface glycoprotein gp41. Its mechanism of action is the competitive binding to HR1 region of the gp41, preventing the interaction between HR1 and HR2 and impeding the conformational changes in gp41 necessary for fusion of the virus with the cell. Its application is by subcutaneous injection. The main clinical trials of enfuvirtide (TORO 1 and 2) were performed in HIV-infected patients with virological failure, high antiretroviral experience and highly resistant viral isolates. Those trials showed that the addition of enfuvirtide to an optimized HAART (chosen with a resistance test) provided better results than HAART alone, measured by drop in viral load and immunologic benefit. The best results were observed in the subgroup of patients with more useful drugs in HAART (according to the information of the resistance test), a lower viral load, and a higher CD4 cell count at baseline. The most important adverse event is the production of injection drug hypersensitivity reaction in 98% of patients. The high cost is compensated by a reduction in costs derived from admissions."

A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."

It makes sense to notice that comorbidity case alowgwith tuberculosis, intestinal candidiasis, bacterial pneumonia and Kaposi's diseases were found out. The screening of the cerebrospinal fluid showed a sound cell count and even low count in 12.2% of cases. Direct examination of cerebrospinal fluid with India ink helps in diagnosis of 97.5% of cases, and the culture carried out from 74 patients was in any case positive. This culture allowed the diagnosis of three patients whose examination along side with India ink has been negative. The CD4 cell count was less than 100/mm(3) in 97.7% of cases. The rate of the fatality cases has been 66.4%, it has been badly impacted by a CD4 count <50/mm(3) and the lack of antiretroviral therapy. Despite the establishment of a national antiretroviral treatment program to do influence the frequency of opportunistic infections whose cryptococcal neuromeningitis, this condition is still present although it is declining.

We identified and characterized a novel type of mutation which is a complex of external insertion, deletion, and internal duplication in sequences from one of six patients with chronic hepatitis B virus genotype E (HBV/E). We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."

We examined 40 protease and 35 reverse transcriptase amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype C from drug inexperienced patients from rural settings in South Africa for resistance mutations. Samples were collected between 2001 and 2004 prior to the availability of antiretrovirals through public health institutions. Ninety-five percent of patients had no major mutations in the protease gene, although substitutions M46L (2.5%) and G73S (2.5%), which according to the Stanford Genotypic Resistance Interpretation Algorithm are considered major mutations, were detected. In addition, a high prevalence of minor mutations was observed in the protease, with at least three minor resistance-associated mutations in 37% of the isolates. An isoleucine insertion at codon 37 was detected in one sequence. Most of the RT sequences were wild-type, although V118I (8.5%) and Y318F (5.7%) associated with resistance to lamivudine and nevirapine, respectively, were observed. Our data suggest that major resistance mutations among the drug-inexperienced population in South Africa may be rare, and routine resistance testing before the initiation of therapy in this initial stage of the treatment program may not be necessary."

Despite its recent expansion in Brazil, HIV-1C already prevails in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. This unique HIV epidemiology has prompted us to characterize that population. Seventy-seven HIV-1-infected subjects attending the largest HIV/AIDS clinic of the state had the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of their virus subtyped and genotyped. When subtype-specific infections were plotted according to year of diagnosis, the prevalence of subtype C was shown to increase over the last 18 years of the epidemic, along with a concomitant decrease of subtype B. Comparison of subtype C-infected treated and untreated subjects revealed amino acid differences in protease and RT, especially in the RT mutation D/G123S. The overall analysis of drug resistance mutations in viruses from treated subjects has highlighted some associations between subtypes and particular mutations, such as V82A/F/T/S in protease and subtype F1 and M41L and L210W in RT and subtype B. The characterization of this important population, which is one of a few in the developing world where a large number of HIV-1C-infected subjects are under antiretroviral treatment, underscores its potential usefulness in clinical, treatment, and vaccine trials in Brazil."

From them, 20 and 4 were HBV DNA positive, respectively. These last four patients are therefore considered to be HBV infected in an occult form. The genotypes could be determined in all 24 HBV-infected patients. HBV-A was the most common (20/24; 83.3%), followed by HBV-D (2/24; 8.3%) and HBV-F (1/24; 4.2%). The remaining sample exhibited mixed infection involving genotypes A and D as pure ones, thus also forming part of three intergenotypic recombinant forms exhibiting different mosaic S gene patterns. The sexual route of transmission was predominant among HBV genotype A-infected patients. Among the 24 HBV DNA-positive patients, point mutations related to lamivudine resistance were found in four strains. These viral strains showed a methionine-to-valine substitution at codon 204 (rtM204V) in association with an upstream B-domain change at rtL180M.

Relatively stable levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, soluble TNF receptor (R)II, soluble interleukin-2R, neopterin, and beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) were documented over 5-8 weeks in patients with AIDS and for 1-4 years in the other groups. beta2M was generally the most stable marker. Interferon-gamma levels, however, fluctuated substantially. Individuals, whether normal or HIV-positive, maintain characteristic plasma levels of cytokines and immune activation markers.

Proposed pathogeneses include a disorder of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, eventually related to a reduction of mitochondrial DNA content, and interference with nerve growth factor activity. Carnitine is a substrate of energy production reactions in mitochondria and is involved in many anabolic reactions. Acetyl carnitine treatment promotes peripheral nerve regeneration and has neuroprotective properties and a direct analgesic role related to glutamatergic and cholinergic modulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate acetyl-l-carnitine in the treatment of painful antiretroviral toxic neuropathy in HIV patients. Twenty subjects affected by painful antiretroviral toxic neuropathy were treated with oral acetyl-l-carnitine at a dose of 2,000 mg/day for a 4-week period. Efficacy was evaluated by means of the modified Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire with each item rated on an 11-point intensity scale at weekly intervals and by electromyography at baseline and final visit. Mean pain intensity score was significantly reduced during the study, changing from 7.35 +/- 1.98 (mean +/- SD) at baseline to 5.80 +/- 2.63 at week 4 (p = 0.0001). Electrophysiological parameters did not significantly change between baseline and week 4.

The higher rate of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion during telbivudine treatment than other potent anti-HBV agents suggests a potential immunomodulatory effect. We sought to determine the effects of telbivudine on the immune system, particularly on cytokine production and T-cell response, using an animal model with mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced hepatitis. The effects of telbivudine on virus replication and cytokine production were investigated in vitro using MHV-3-infected macrophages, and the effects on T-cell response were investigated in vivo in an MHV-3-induced viral hepatitis model. Telbivudine had no effect on MHV-3 replication in macrophages. However, the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-12 was increased significantly in MHV-3-induced macrophages treated with telbivudine. In vivo survival was enhanced in telbivudine-treated mice, with marked normalization in clinical conditions and histological lesions. Serum levels of interferon-gamma were elevated significantly after telbivudine treatment in MHV-3-infected C3H mice. In contrast, serum interleukin-4 levels were decreased significantly. Furthermore, telbivudine treatment enhanced the ability of T cells to undergo proliferation and secrete cytokines but did not affect cytotoxicity of infected hepatocytes. Of note, we found that telbivudine treatment suppressed programmed death ligand 1 expression on T cells. The results demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of telbivudine, independent of its antiviral activity, in a mouse model of MHV-3-induced hepatitis."

HIV-infected U937 cells exhibited markedly lower levels of CD4 and HLA-DR antigens than uninfected cells did. Vitamin D3 induced a time-dependent macrophagelike differentiation, as determined by monitoring the expression of some surface antigens by means of the monoclonal antibodies OKM1, OKM5, OKM13, OKM14, OKT4, anti-HLA-DR, TecMG2, TecMG3, LeuM3, LeuM1, anti-HLA-DP, and anti-HLA-DQ. Treatment with hydroxyvitamin D3 resulted in a marked increase in HIV production compared with control cultures. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected in the culture media, whereas interferon (IFN) was not generally found. Using the polymerase chain reaction technique, we found HIV-infected U937 cells to express detectable levels of mRNAs for alpha interferon (IFN-alpha), IFN-beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta. The addition of TNF resulted in a marked increase of HIV production, whereas IL-1 beta was ineffective. In contrast, both IFN-alpha and IFN-beta exerted some inhibitory effect on HIV production, which was more marked in vitamin D3-treated cultures than in untreated cultures. HIV production was significantly increased by antibodies to IFN-alpha in both untreated and vitamin D3-treated cultures. Anti-IFN-beta antibody increased HIV production only in vitamin D3-treated cells. In contrast, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies markedly decreased HIV production in both control and differentiating U937 cells. Vitamin D3 treatment resulted in a higher expression of TNF receptors in differentiating cells than in control HIV-infected cells. These data demonstrate a strong correlation between HIV production and macrophagelike differentiation in chronically infected U937 cells and suggest that endogenous IFN and TNF exert opposite effects in the regulation of virus production in both undifferentiated and vitamin D3-treated cell cultures."

HIV-infected and uninfected U937 cells exhibited the same growth patterns in culture. However, HIV-infected cells were not tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously in nude mice, whereas large solid tumors were observed in mice injected with uninfected U937 cells. Injection of nude mice with antibody to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) enabled HIV-infected U937 cells to grow progressively in approximately 90 to 100% of mice. HIV-infected U937 cells formed solid tumors in the majority (60 to 90%) of either immunosuppressed (splenectomized, irradiated, and anti-asialo-GM1-treated) or genetically immunodeficient (bg/nu/xid) nude mice. In mice treated with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta with established HIV-positive tumors, a direct correlation was found between p24 antigenemia and tumor size. Treatment of established HIV-positive U937 cell tumors with human IFN-alpha or mouse IFN-alpha/beta resulted in a clear-cut inhibition of both tumor growth and p24 HIV antigenemia. In contrast, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha markedly inhibited tumor growth but did not significantly decrease serum p24 levels. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine treatment did not affect either tumor growth or the levels of serum p24 antigen. These data indicate that endogenous IFN-alpha/beta is a crucial factor in the restriction of both tumor growth and p24 antigenemia in mice injected with HIV-infected tumor cells. Moreover, the results suggest that the development of HIV-1 p24 antigenemia in athymic immunosuppressed mice may represent an interesting in vivo model for anti-HIV therapy."

Candidate vaginal microbicides should provide protection against circulating strains, be cheap, stable on storage, safe and easy to use. Here we describe a detailed study of the safety and efficacy of Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) in vitro, and in an ex vivo model of female genital tissue explants. CV-N demonstrated potent activity in the low nanomolar range against laboratory and primary isolates. Activity was related to the affinity of CV-N for binding to whole virions as determined by acoustic resonance. Potent activity was also observed against cell-associated HIV-1, although slightly reduced. CV-N activity in the presence of whole semen was reduced by 7-10-fold, although it remained in the low nanomolar range and was minimally modified by the presence of Candida albicans. Furthermore, CV-N potently inhibited infection of ectocervical explants and virus dissemination by tissue-emigrating cells. In peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assays, CV-N was shown to have some mitogenic activity following 3 days exposure to compound, and this was associated with a modest increase in expression of gamma interferon, stromal cell-derived factor 1beta and interleukin 4. However, 2 h exposure to CV-N had no effect on cytokine expression in PBMC or tissue explant culture over a 24 h period, suggesting that the potential for inflammation is low. Data presented here indicate that targeting HIV envelope glycoproteins may provide an effective strategy to prevent HIV-1 infection mediated by either cell-free virus or infected cells."

VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."

PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65 NF-kappa B binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin. No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells. Induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1. In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines, induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC resulted in clear induction of luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic kappa B enhancers or wild type, but not kappa B-mutated, HIV long terminal repeat constructs. HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes. NF-kappa B activation promoted by addition of exogenous PC-PLC correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol. However, addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC from B. cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate kappa B enhancer-directed vectors. PC-PLC-induced NF-kappa B activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol ester-inducible protein kinases C. These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway, dependent on specific PC breakdown, is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the HIV enhancer."

To determine the effects of PRR-mediated innate immune response on hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, a 1.3mer HBV genome was cotransfected into HepG2 or Huh7 cells with plasmid expressing TLR adaptors, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing beta interferon (TRIF), or RIG-I/MDA5 adaptor, interferon promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1). The results showed that expressing each of the three adaptors dramatically reduced the levels of HBV mRNA and DNA in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells. However, HBV replication was not significantly affected by treatment of HBV genome-transfected cells with culture media harvested from cells transfected with each of the three adaptors, indicating that the adaptor-induced antiviral response was predominantly mediated by intracellular factors rather than by secreted cytokines. Analyses of involved signaling pathways revealed that activation of NF-kappaB is required for all three adaptors to elicit antiviral response in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells. However, activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 is only essential for induction of antiviral response by IPS-1 in Huh7 cells, but not in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, our results suggest that besides NF-kappaB, additional signaling pathway(s) are required for TRIF to induce a maximum antiviral response against HBV. Knowing the molecular mechanisms by which PRR-mediated innate defense responses control HBV infections could potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics that evoke the host cellular innate antiviral response to control HBV infections."

In this study, we investigated the HGV RNA changes and responses to IFN therapy of HGV RNA-positive hepatitis C patients. The presence of HGV RNA in 264 patients who received IFN therapy at our institute was examined using the nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers deduced from the 5' non-coding region (5'-NCR) of the HGV. We also analysed the nucleotide sequences of the 5'-NCR and HGV before and after IFN therapy. Twelve (4.5%) of the 264 patients with chronic hepatitis C were HGV RNA positive. Of these 12 patients, full information was available in nine. Of those nine, seven became HGV RNA negative during IFN therapy but in six of the seven a relapse occurred. HCV RNA was not detected 1 year after IFN therapy in six patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of all the HCV RNA-negative patients post-treatment was within the normal range, irrespective of their HGV RNA status. Nucleotide sequences did not change after IFN therapy in any patient. Hence, we confirm that HGV is sensitive to IFN therapy but the liver damage caused by HGV infection is very mild or does not modify the liver function tests."

It has been suggested that suppression of HBV replication is not sufficient for patients with hepatitis B and the damaged liver function requires restoration. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were combined with short hairpin (sh)RNA to treat liver injury and suppress HBV replication in a mouse model. Lx‑shRNA157‑1694 (an shRNA expression plasmid containing two shRNA expression cassettes) and mouse immortal (mi)MSCs stably expressing shRNA (miMSC‑shRNA) were constructed and their suppressive effects on HBV expression were investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR), ELISA and immunofluorescence. Hepatogenic differentiation of miMSC‑shRNA was induced in vitro and confirmed by morphology, reverse transcription‑semi‑quantitative and ‑quantitative PCR, urea production and Periodic acid‑Schiff staining analyses. miMSCs and the shRNA expression plasmid alone or combined with miMSCs stably expressing shRNA were injected into mice. The former therapeutic regimen successfully suppressed HBV expression in sera and liver tissue, whereas the latter only suppressed HBV expression in liver tissue. Analyses of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, aspartate aminotransferase levels, liver weight/body weight ratio percentage and sirius red staining demonstrated marked amelioration of liver injury in mice treated with both therapeutic regimens. The results of the present study suggest that miMSCs combined with shRNA treatment may alleviate liver injury and suppress HBV expression, thus providing a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver injury induced by HBV infection."

To investigate whether GBV-C/HGV plays a role among Korean patients with liver diseases, GBV-C/HGV RNA were evaluated in 337 sera by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers derived from 5'-noncoding region of GBV-C/HGV genome. GBV-C/HGV RNA was identified in 11/337 (3.3%). They consisted of 1/160 (0.6%) and 10/177 (3.3%) among the general population and patients with liver diseases, respectively (P < 0.01). Nucleotide sequences of all PCR amplicons were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method and analyzed by molecular evolutionary methods. The phylogenetic tree showed all sequences could be divided into three genotypes. These results indicate that: (1) GBV-C/HGV already exist in Korea; (2) GBV-C/HGV may play some role as an etiologic factor among the Korean patients with liver diseases; (3) GBV-C/HGV infection is rare among Korean general population; and (4) there are at least three different types of GBV-C/HGV in Korea."

Previous studies have reported that GBV-C is associated with posttransfusion hepatitis, chronic viral hepatitis, and cryptogenic hepatitis. However, the clinical significance of GBV-C infection has been questioned increasingly in patients not undergoing transplantation. To investigate whether GBV-C infection under immunosuppression affects the clinical or the histological outcome in liver transplant recipients, we determined the prevalence and incidence of GBV-C infections and the clinical and histological signs in patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The presence of GBV-C was tested in sera from patients before and in regular intervals up to 6 years after OLT by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from the NS3 region. A total of 72 patients were studied. Before OLT, 8 of 72 (11.1%) patients were positive for GBV-C. After OLT, 7 of 8 (87.5%) remained positive. Of 64 patients who were negative for GBV-C before OLT, 23 became positive after OLT, resulting in a de novo rate of GBV-C infection of 35.9%. We could not detect a higher rate of histologically proven hepatitis in GBV-C-positive patients (29.1%) than in GBV-C-negative patients (14.6%, P > 0.057). Comparing GBV-C-positive with GBV-C-negative liver transplant patients, we could not find any differences in age, gender, liver function tests, number of blood transfusions, histological degree of hepatitis, or number of rejection episodes. Survival was not negatively influenced by GBV-C positivity. In conclusion, the presence of GBV-C did not influence the clinical or histological outcome in liver transplant patients."

These agents are reported to induce a higher mortality than other causes of fulminant hepatitis. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) at present constitute the major identifiable non-A, non-B hepatitis agents. Of these, HEV has been established as the sole cause of epidemic hepatitis in Afro-Asian countries, and fulminant hepatitis has been recorded during such epidemics. However, in sporadic cases, the etiological role of HEV in fulminant hepatitis has remained uncertain. The role of HCV in acute liver disease and fulminant hepatitis remains unclear. The present study was undertaken to investigate the association of HEV and HCV in patients with fulminant hepatitis by direct detection of the viral genome using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Serum samples from 50 serologically identified non-A, non-B fulminant hepatitis cases negative for cryptic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection examined via PCR were tested for HEV and HCV RNA using RT-PCR. For HEV primers from the nonstructural region (ORF-1) were used, and for HCV primers from the highly conserved 5' untranslated regions were used. The products were analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis and confirmed by hybridisation with radiolabelled internal oligonucleotide probes. HEV was detected in 31 (62%) of the 50 fulminant non-A, non-B hepatitis cases. In 18 (36%) cases, HCV RNA was detected. In 11 (22%) of the HCV cases, the HEV genome was also amplified.

The patients under effective HAART were recruited in three different hospitals in Spain, and none of them had been treated (naïve) before entering this study. HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined, and nucleotide sequences of proviral regions encoding protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) were obtained for longitudinal blood samples spanning a mean follow-up period of 88 weeks. Phylogenetic reconstructions and calculations of genetic distances among the different sequences of each patient were performed. All except one of the patients under study showed an early and sustained decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA to levels that were below 200 copies/ml. The plasma viral decline paralleled a significant increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts. Amino acid sequence analyses revealed the occurrence of mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance in nine patients (14.3%) during HAART treatment, that in some cases could be attributed to excess G to A transitions. In six of the nine patients, the mutations conferred resistance to inhibitors administered in the treatment regime, although the mutations did not result in treatment failure. Sequence comparisons revealed viral evolution during the period of treatment in 47.5% of the patients. The results indicate successful suppression of HIV-1 under HAART for extended time periods, indistinguishable for patients in which evidence of virus evolution could or could not be documented."
6614,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The innate immune system is a significant component of the brain's defense against infection, especially as the blood-brain barrier restricts access of the members of the adaptive immune system, such as T and B cells. The innate immune system includes Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Within the central nervous system, they are expressed on glial cells and their expression can be modulated by pathological states. Although their function is to recognize foreign pathogens and stimulate a protective immune response through the production of cytokines and interferons, there is emerging evidence that activation of these receptors can result in neurodegeneration. In the current study, the authors assessed the expression of TLR-related genes, using a customized Superarray gene chip, and correlated the expression findings with indices of neurodegeneration. We found that, using a stringent threshold for statistical significance to overcome the potential problem of multiple statistical testing, there were significant correlations between the expression of nine TLR-related genes and reduction in dendritic and synaptic staining. Two of these genes, TLR4 and SIGIRR, were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the authors demonstrated in vitro at the protein level that human primary astrocytes exposed to the toxic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein gp120 had a significant increase in TLR4 protein expression. In conclusion, these findings indicate that TLR-related gene expression may contribute to the development of HIV-related neurodegeneration."

Furthermore, new evidence suggests that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the course of infection is beneficial for individuals infected with HIV and reduces the rate of sexual transmission to partners who are not infected. Screening should be performed after women have been notified that HIV screening is recommended for all pregnant patients and that they will receive an HIV test as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests unless they decline (opt-out screening). Obstetrician-gynecologists or other obstetric providers should follow opt-out prenatal HIV screening where legally possible. Repeat HIV testing in the third trimester is recommended for women in areas with high HIV incidence or prevalence and women known to be at risk of acquiring HIV infection. Women who were not tested earlier in pregnancy or whose HIV status is otherwise undocumented should be offered rapid screening on labor and delivery using the opt-out approach where allowed. If a rapid HIV test result in labor is reactive, antiretroviral prophylaxis should be immediately initiated while waiting for supplemental test results. If the diagnosis of HIV infection is established, the woman should be linked into ongoing care with a specialist in HIV care for comanagement. "

Among the seropositives, all of five evaluable had been exposed to blood and four of five to needle-stick injuries.

We analyzed data from persons who tested positive for past or current HCV infection during participation in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 through 2008. A follow-up survey was conducted 6 months after examination to determine (1) how many participants testing positive for HCV infection were aware of their HCV status before being notified by NHANES, (2) what actions participants took after becoming aware of their first positive test, and (3) participants' knowledge about hepatitis C. Of 30,140 participants tested, 393 (1.3%) had evidence of past or current HCV infection and 170 (43%) could be contacted during the follow-up survey and interviewed. Only 49.7% were aware of their positive HCV infection status before being notified by NHANES, and only 3.7% of these respondents reported that they had first been tested for HCV because they or their doctor thought they were at risk for infection. Overall, 85.4% had heard of hepatitis C; correct responses to questions about hepatitis C were higher among persons 40-59 years of age, white non-Hispanics, and respondents who saw a physician after their first positive HCV test.

However, there is little information about the risk of infection among non-injection drug users (non-IDUs). The present study was designed to perform several objectives: (a) to evaluate the prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B, D, C virus and HIV in IDU and non-IDU patients; (b) to compare the prevalence of these markers between both groups; (c) to identify risk factors for HCV and HIV in this population; and (d) to correlate the presence of HCV and liver function. A total of 385 consecutive patients (122 IDUs and 263 non-IDUs), admitted to the Drug Dependency Treatment Unit at the Hospital Insular of Gran Canaria between 1993 to 1994, were included in the study. The serological markers of HBV, HDV, HCV and HIV were determined by ELISA and immunoblot methods. In all cases we also measured syphilis tests (RPR and FTAabs), serum aminotransferases and serum gammaglutamiltranspeptidase. Compared to the non-IDU, the IDU group presents a higher prevalence of antiHBc (55.0% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001), antiHCV (87.6% vs. 35.3%, p < 0.0001) and antiHIV (21.8% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in RPR positivity (0.9% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.06). Delta infection was only detected in injection drug users, and the prevalence was low. Using logistic regression, the only risk factors associated with antiHCV positivity were injection drug addiction (OR: 9.2, 95% CI: 4.9-17.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 3.0-9.9). Similarly, the associated risk factors for HIV were injection drug addiction (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 2.3-15.0) and antiHBc positivity (OR: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5-9.2). However, no correlation was found between antiHCV positive and antiHIV or between these markers and RPR positivity. Patients positive for antiHCV showed significant elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, when compared with patients negative for antiHCV: 65.0 vs. 39.2 U/l (p < 0.001) and 88.4 vs. 40.3 U/l (p < 0.001), respectively. We conclude that drug users have an elevated prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV infection, even if drug use is only inhalated. On the other hand, the main risk factors associated with HCV and HIV are injection drug addiction and exposure to hepatitis B virus. Finally, in the study population, liver dysfunction is closely related to HCV infection."

Currently there is lack of large samples and long-term systematic observations of ocular pathological changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and AIDS patients. Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "
792,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests have gained popularity to predict histology in view of the associated risks of biopsy. However, many models include tests not readily available, and there are limited data from patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. We aimed to develop a model using routine tests to predict liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. A retrospective analysis of liver histology was performed in 832 patients. Liver fibrosis was assessed via Ishak score; patients were categorized as 0-1, 2-3, or 4-6 and were randomly assigned to training (n = 555) or validation (n = 277) sets. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that platelet count (PLT), age, AST, and INR were significantly associated with fibrosis. Additional analysis revealed PLT, age, AST, and ALT as an alternative model. Based on this, a simple index (FIB-4) was developed: age ([yr] x AST [U/L]) / ((PLT [10(9)/L]) x (ALT [U/L])(1/2)). The AUROC of the index was 0.765 for differentiation between Ishak stage 0-3 and 4-6. At a cutoff of <1.45 in the validation set, the negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (stage 4-6) was 90% with a sensitivity of 70%. A cutoff of >3.25 had a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97%. Using these cutoffs, 87% of the 198 patients with FIB-4 values outside 1.45-3.25 would be correctly classified, and liver biopsy could be avoided in 71% of the validation group. In conclusion, noninvasive tests can accurately predict hepatic fibrosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy in the majority of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."

Of 38 patients diagnosed with HCC since 1969, adequate tissue was available from both the tumor and nontumorous liver in 17. Of the 17 specimens, 14 had chronic portal inflammation and three had advanced cirrhosis; 12 of the 14 were from hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. These 12 cases were studied in detail to examine the features accompanying the development of HCC unobscured by cirrhotic transformation. In the noninvolved parenchyma they included hepatocytic nodules as apparent precursors to HCC and, as markers of phenotypic alterations, dysplastic hepatocytes and hepatitis B surface antigen-laden ground-glass hepatocytes. The latter were observed in eight instances and often accumulated in nodules. Parenchyma within 1 mm of the HCC exhibited increased confluent hyperplasia and frequently conspicuous necroinflammation associated with pericellular and periductular fibrosis, which contributed, in addition to fibrous connections between displaced and heavily inflamed portal tracts, to the capsule that was forming in all cases to varying degrees in the pericarcinomatous region. The HCC was uniformly trabecular and in a few specimens, a continuous transition from hyperplasia and dysplasia near the periphery of the tumor to increasing anaplasia in the center could be made out in addition to pressure effects of the HCC. The pericarcinomatous changes, including hyperplasia progressing to neoplasia and necroinflammation, are also observed in experimental models, particularly the woodchuck HCC induced by a hepadna virus related to HBV. Coordinated morphologic and molecular biologic studies on such animal models and on human HCC detected by screening, as for instance in Eskimos, neither complicated by cirrhosis, should elucidate the direction of the evolution of the HCC and the postulated promoting role of the inflammation."
9606,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Of all the hepatotropic viruses, HBV is associated with the greatest worldwide morbidity and mortality. This is because of the ease of transmission and the potential for progression to a chronic infective carrier state, with the complications of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of PCR has shown that some of the earlier concepts concerning the interpretation of serological data were inaccurate. Many patients with anti-HBe and anti-HBs have viral DNA detectable by PCR, and some hepatocellular carcinoma patients have detectable HBV DNA in their livers in the absence of all serological markers of HBV disease. The clearance of HBV infected cells from the liver is dependent on the interplay between the interferon system and the cellular limb of the host immune response. The importance of the nucleocapsid proteins as targets for sensitized cytotoxic T cells has been established for chronic HBV infection. The importance of pre-S sequences as inducers and targets of the virus-neutralizing humoral immune response is becoming established, but their precise role must await the development of in vitro models of hepadnavirus infection and a greater understanding of the mechanisms of viral uptake. The epidemiology and clinical course of the disease can be modified by immunization, immune stimulation and antiviral chemotherapy. For the developing world, a programme of immunization at birth would be the most effective way of eliminating this disease, but at present the cost is prohibitive. For the developed world, immunization is realistic for the at-risk population, and anti-viral and immunostimulatory therapy available for those already infected. In adult acquired chronic HBV infection alpha-interferon produces HBe antigen clearance in 40-60% of cases and is followed by resolution of the hepatic inflammation. Results in neonatally acquired infection are less impressive and prednisolone priming followed by interferon may be needed. The presence of a mutation in the pre-core region of some virus isolates has recently been described. Hepatocytes infected with this virus cannot produce HBe antigen and the course of the liver disease is fairly rapid. Whether this mutant causes liver damage in the same way as the wild virus or is directly cytopathic remains unclear, and its relationship to fulminant hepatitis is under investigation."

We retrospectively collected clinical data on chronic HBV-infected patients who had developed LAM resistance under de novo LAM monotherapy and subsequently took nucleos(t)ide analogs as rescue strategy in our hospital. From initiation of rescue therapies to January 2012, incidence of antiviral drug resistance was 23.67%, 18%, 6.94% and 0% (P=0.007) in the group of switching to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) monotherapy, switching to entecavir (ETV) monotherapy, adding on ADV and switching to combination of ADV and ETV. At month 12, the median levels of serum HBV DNA were respectively 9300IU/mL, 4648IU/mL, 2054IU/mL and 100IU/mL (P<0.001), and the cumulative rates of serum ALT normalization were respectively 75%, 84%, 93% and 100% (P=0.003). Additionally, the strategy of switching to ADV monotherapy induced more single rtA181T mutations. In conclusion, switching to ADV monotherapy has been widely used in real-world clinical practice in China, however, due to the high incidence of drug resistance, switching to neither ADV nor ETV monotherapy is optimal when LAM resistance occurs; combination of ADV and ETV is most effective, whereas the strategy of adding on ADV is rational for most of LAM-resistant Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B."

HBV vaccination with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) prevents transmission of overt infection to the babies. However, whether it also prevents occult HBV infection in babies is not known. Consecutive pregnant women of any gestation found to be HBsAg positive were followed till delivery, and their babies were included in the study. Immediately after delivery, babies were randomized to receive either HBIG or placebo in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine (at 0, 6, 10 and 14 weeks). The primary end-point of the study, assessed at 18 weeks of age, was remaining free of any HBV infection (either overt or occult) plus the development of adequate immune response to vaccine. The babies were further followed up for a median of 2 years of age to determine their eventual outcome. Risk factors for HBV transmission and for poor immune response in babies were studied. Of the 283 eligible babies, 259 were included in the trial and randomized to receive either HBIG (n=128) or placebo (n=131) in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine. Of the 222 of 259 (86%) babies who completed 18 weeks of follow-up, only 62/222 (28%) reached primary end-point. Of the remaining, 6/222 (3%) developed overt HBV infection, 142/222 (64%) developed occult HBV infection, and 12/222 (5%) had no HBV infection but had poor immune response. All 6 overt infections occurred in the placebo group (P=0.030), while occult HBV infections were more common in the HBIG group (76/106 [72%] vs. 66/116 [57%]; P=0.025). This may be due to the immune pressure of HBIG. There was no significant difference between the two groups in frequency of babies developing poor immune response or those achieving primary end-point. The final outcome of these babies at 24 months of age was as follows: overt HBV infection 4%, occult HBV infection 42%, no HBV infection but poor immune response 8% and no HBV infection with good immune response 28%. Women who were anti-HBe positive were a low-risk group, and their babies were most likely to remain free of HBV infection (occult or overt) and had good immune response to the vaccine. Maternal HBeAg-positive status and negativity for anti-HBe predicted not only overt but also any infection (both overt and occult) in babies. In addition, high maternal HBV DNA and treatment with vaccine alone were significant factors for overt HBV infection in babies. The current practice of administration of vaccine with HBIG at birth to babies born of HBsAg-positive mothers is not effective in preventing occult HBV infection in babies, which may be up to 40%. Because the most important risk factors for mother-to-baby transmission of HBV infection are the replicative status and high HBV DNA level in mothers; it will be worthwhile investigating the role of antivirals and HBIG administration during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection."

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms that may contribute to the rise of PRL. We measured serum PRL levels in 54 HIV-infected and 85 healthy age-matched men. The association between PRL levels among anti-PRL autoantibodies and other clinical variables in HIV-infected men was studied. We also evaluated the changes in serum PRL levels by chromatographic separation (affinity with protein G and gel filtration) after a 10-mg iv bolus of metoclopramide. HIV-infected men had higher serum PRL levels compared with healthy men. Sera from 9 of the 54 (16.7%)HIV-infected men were found to have hyperprolactinemia. Moreover, the anti-PRL autoantibody was present in four of nine (44.4%)HIV-infected men with hyperprolactinemia; it was also associated with hyperprolactinemic status. Serum total PRL levels were higher in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies than hyperprolactinemic HIV-infected men without anti-PRL autoantibodies; by contrast, free PRL levels were lower. In HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies, gel filtration showed that big big PRL isoform was present as the predominant circulating form of PRL throughout each measurement after iv metoclopramide. By contrast, the predominant isoform of PRL in serum from healthy men and HIV-infected men who were anti-PRL autoantibody negative was little PRL. On the other hand, high serum total PRL levels were observed at each measurement throughout the metoclopramide test in HIV-infected men with anti-PRL autoantibodies; however, the serum free PRL levels were similar to those found in subjects without anti-PRL autoantibodies. These data demonstrated that anti-PRL autoantibodies are associated with hyperprolactinemic status in HIV-infected subjects, particularly in those with high serum PRL levels."

Economic analyses of different types that have been performed for several countries to investigate the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid for treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLHIV) based on the clinical data gathered in the POWER and TITAN trials are reviewed for consistency and their value to different decision-makers is assessed. Cost-utility analyses for the USA and several European countries indicate that DRV/r-based HAART is cost effective compared with other standard of care protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimens in PLHIV with evidence of PI resistance. For all of these countries, the estimated cost-utility ratio is well below typical benchmark values and these ratios are robust, as demonstrated by one-way sensitivity and variability analyses and multi-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Studies using other metrics including the average 1-year drug cost per patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the incremental drug cost per additional patient with a plasma HIV-RNA level less than 50 copies/mL at 48 weeks, the total (antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral) costs during the first year of treatment, and the total healthcare budget impact during the first 5 years of treatment provided further evidence of the positive economic outcomes with the use of DRV/r in treatment-experienced PLHIV. Different measures of economic outcomes are useful for different types of decision-makers and different types of decisions. In general, the results of these different types of analyses will be consistent with each other. For darunavir, the economic analyses reviewed in this paper demonstrate that the use of DRV/r 600/100 mg bid in the management of HIV-infected, treatment-experienced adults who have failed at least one of the other currently available PIs is cost effective and may be cost saving."

Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation. This study reports the predominance of HBeAg (-ve) and HBV core promoter mutation."

This assay approach could detect preC mutants or wild-type sequences when either form constituted more than 10% of the total sample. Overall, 65.5% (76/116) of HBeAg-positive carriers had only the preC wild-type. All HBeAg-positive asymptomatic carriers (n = 14) had only the preC wild-type. In patients with chronic hepatitis B and in anti-HBe-positive asymptomatic carriers, increased prevalence of the preC mutant was associated with the development of anti-HBe antibodies and normalization of the serum alanine aminotransferase concentration. Furthermore, 27 (29.0%) of 93 HBeAg-negative carriers had unexpectedly preC wild-type sequences only. Direct sequencing of the HBV precore region of HBV specimens from 24 patients revealed no mutation at nt 1896, supporting the specificity of the RFLP analysis. These results suggest that RFLP analysis was accurate for the detection of the preC mutation and that the absence of serum HBeAg cannot be explained solely by the dominance of the preC mutant."

A total of 1021 healthy controls, 302 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance subjects, and 2011 HBsAg-positive subjects (including 1021 HCC patients) were enrolled in this study. Quantitative PCR was used to genotype rs3783553. HBV mutations were determined by direct sequencing. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations of rs3783553, mutations, and their interactions with the risk of HCC. No significant association was found between rs3783553 and the risk of HCC among healthy controls, HBsAg seroclearance subjects, HBsAg-positive subjects without HCC, and all controls. Additionally, rs3783553 was not significantly associated with chronic HBV infection, liver cirrhosis, HBV e antigen seroconversion, abnormal alanine aminotransferase, and high viral load (> 10(4) copies/ml). However, the TTCA insertion allele of rs3783553 was significantly associated with an increased frequency of HBV C7A mutation compared with homozygous TTCA deletion carriers [(del/ins + ins/ins) vs. del/del, adjusted odds ratio (OR)= 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI)= 1.09-2.02, P = 0.013]. Multiplicative interaction of rs3783553 with HBV preS deletion significantly reduced the risk of HCC in males, with an adjusted OR of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.42-0.98; P = 0.041) after age and HBV genotype were adjusted. Although rs3783553 did not significantly affect genetic susceptibility to HBV-related HCC, its variant allele may predispose the host to selecting HBV C7A mutation during evolution and significantly reduce the risk of HCC caused by HBV preS deletion. This study provides an insight into the complex host-virus interaction in HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and is helpful in determining HBsAg-positive subjects who are likely to develop HCC. "
9288,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hepatocarcinogenesis is heavily influenced by chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection. Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) have been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with viral infection. The gene encoding SERPINE1 is highly polymorphic and the frequently associated 4/5 guanosine (4G/5G) polymorphism in the gene promoter may influence its expression. Here, we investigated the distribution of genotypes and the frequency of alleles of the 4G/5G polymorphism in patients with HCC, the influence of the 4G/5G polymorphism on plasma SERPINE1 levels and its association with viral infection. A total of 75 patients with HCC were enrolled: 32 (42.6%) were HBV(+)/HCV(+), 11 (14.6%) were only HCV(+), and 32 (42.6%) were negative for both viruses. A control group of healthy donors was also enrolled (n=50). SERPINE1 plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA and the detection of the promoter 4G/5G polymorphism was performed by an allele-specific PCR analysis. We found that the frequency of both the 4G/4G genotype (p=0.02) and the 4G allele (p=0.006) were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to the control group, and particularly higher in patients with HCC co-infected with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than in those with no viral infection. We also found that patients with the 4G/4G genotype had significantly higher plasma SERPINE1 protein levels when compared with patients with the 4G/5G or 5G/5G genotype (p<0.001). Differences in frequency of 4G allele and genetic variability of 4G/5G SERPINE1 polymorphism with a higher level of SERPINE1 protein in patients with HCC with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than those without infection, suggest the presence of two distinct pathogenic mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis, depending on the etiology."

Mutations in the HBV genome, in particular precore (PC) and basal core promoter (BCP) mutations, may be important factors in the pathogenesis of disease. In this study genetic heterogeneity and phylogenetic analysis of HBV isolates from 32 naïve patients with acute HBV infection was investigated. Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had self-limiting illness. Only four isolates from patients with severe HBV infection harbored the G1896A stop codon mutation. One isolate (Irish-13), collected from a patient with acute asymptomatic infection, had a G1896A mutation and a 243 bp deletion of the polymerase gene. A triple mutation, T1753C/A1762T/G1764A was identified in only one isolate (Irish-3) associated with severe infection. The latter also had a mutation, A2339G, in the core gene, not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by genotype D. Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 isolates, including Gly145Ala, associated with vaccine immune escape, Asp144Glu, Ser143Leu and Phe134Leu, each associated with failure to detect HBsAg. Phylogenetic analysis was determined using amplicons of the S gene (678 bp) and distal-X/PC region (672 bp). Genotype A was the most common (75%), followed by genotype D (15.6%), and equal proportions of C, E, F, and H. A novel recombinant of genotypes D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West Africa. Genetic heterogeneity of HBV isolates of HBV isolates from patients with acute infection needs further study of its significance."

Genetic polymorphisms in the chemokine receptors and their ligands were related to the susceptibility and resistance to HIV-1 infection. A polymorphism in the conserved 3' untranslated region of the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) gene, which encodes a ligand of the CXCR4 receptor, has been related either to delayed progression to AIDS or to rapid disease progression and death. Global, regional, and ethnic distributions of frequencies of SDF1 genotypes and of the SDF1-3'A allele vary significantly. Although the HIV-1 epidemic is increasing in Brazil, little information about the frequencies of host genetic mutations related to HIV/AIDS resistance in the Brazilian population has been reported. To address this question, this study was carried out in order to determine the frequencies of the SDF1 polymorphism and the SDF1-3'A allele on 1061 genomic DNA samples purified from peripheral blood cells of 136 healthy individuals (group 1), 147 HIV-1-exposed seronegative individuals (group 2), 161 HIV-1-infected asymptomatic individuals and with CD4(+) T-cells count 350 mm(-3) (group 3), and 617 HIV-1-infected individuals with AIDS and/or CD4(+) T-cells count < 350 mm(-3) (group 4). The frequencies of the SDF1-3'A homozygous mutation were 3.7%, 6.1%, 4.3%, and 5.3% among groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (P = 0.5120). The overall frequency of the SDF1-3'A allele was 0. 1984 and did not differ among the four groups (P = 0.2744). The results underscore the global distribution of the SDF1 polymorphism and the hypothesis that the SDF1-3'A allele, itself, may not be sufficient to prevent the risk of HIV-1 infection and may be not related to the progression of the disease in the Brazilian population."

These subjects were adult residents of Baltimore City and the surrounding Maryland counties, recruited via outreach into the community between February 1988 and March 1989. In contrast to the first report on the cocaine-HIV association, the present study sample was not recruited solely from drug treatment programs. In the present study, estimated HIV seroprevalence was 26.4% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 10.6% among all other recent intravenous drug users; the relative odds estimate was 3.03. In the untreated segment of the sample, HIV seroprevalence was 26.0% for recent cocaine injectors as compared with 8.9% among others (relative odds (RO) = 3.61). The estimated degree of association did not change appreciably when multiple logistic regression was used to hold constant potentially confounding and/or mediating variables such as receptive anal intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of injection equipment obtained at shooting galleries (RO = 2.64). Augmenting these cross-sectional data, preliminary prospective data showed excess risk of HIV seroconversion among recent cocaine injectors (estimated relative risk = 2.11). While other research has examined the cocaine-HIV association, the present study differs in that it has allowed a test for whether the association was a spurious artifact of studying drug users recruited solely from drug treatment programs, a broad array of alternative determinants of HIV infection have been held constant, and the association has been examined with seroconversion data. The results lend support to the abiding concern about the risk of HIV infection among cocaine users."

Overall, 121 swabs (22%) yielded Staphylococcus aureus, there being significantly higher carriage in HIV-positive patients (71/264, 27%) than in HIV-negative patients (50/290, 17%); p = 0.008. Antimicrobial resistance rates were determined for 110 isolates and were high for penicillin (91%) and tetracycline (72%) and low for erythromycin (8%), methicillin (3%), gentamicin (5%) and chloramphenicol (0%). Genetic analysis showed plasmids in the range of 24-42 MDa to be associated with beta-lactamase production and plasmids in the range of 3-5 MDa to be associated with resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin and trimethoprim. All nine erythromycin-resistant strains were from HIV-positive patients (p = 0.02). There was a significant association of tetracycline resistance with HIV seropositivity (p = 0.002). The association of HIV seropositivity with Staphylococcus aureus carriage and carriage of antibiotic-resistant strains against the background of the HIV epidemic are of relevance in individual patient care and raise concern for public health."

Twenty-four patients (23.8%) had anti-HBc alone as a serological marker compared with four patients who were positive for anti-HBs alone and 12 patients (11.9%) who were anti-HBc and anti-HBs-positive. Occult HBV infection (presence of HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg) is found to be relatively high (28.7%) in HIV-infected Lebanese patients and the overwhelming majority (83.3%) of those who were positive for anti-HBc alone had a detectable HBV DNA in their serum. However, none of our HIV-positive patients with occult HBV infection had abnormal alanine aminotransferase level, which also raises the question as to whether occult HBV plays a role in the aetiology of liver disease in HIV-infected patients.

3911,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The simultaneous presence of multiple HIV-1 subtypes has become common in communities with the growth of the pandemic. As a consequence, the potentiality for an increased frequency of HIV-1 mixed infections caused by viruses of distinct subtypes could be expected. Thus, there is a need to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype as well as coinfections caused by two or more HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. To address this need, we have developed a genetic method based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to screen for these two types of infections within infected populations. In this assay, restriction enzymes may be used to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1 infected samples. A 297 bp pol fragment spanning the entire viral protease gene and a 311 bp fragment of the p24 gag region are used for this analysis. The viral regions are amplified by nested PCR using DNA templates from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or virus culture. Classification of HIV-1 strains to well defined subtypes B, D, F, and A/C is done by sequential endonuclease restriction analysis of a PCR amplified-protease gene followed by analysis of the p24 gag region. The electrophoretic migration patterns visualized by ethidium bromide staining or by radiolabeled probes are then determined on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. In infections caused by viruses of a singular subtype, a single restriction pattern is detected, whereas in multiple infections caused by two or more viral strains of different subtypes, the combination of different digestion patterns are observed in infected individuals. Using this methodology we have screened for genetic variations in HIV-1 proviral DNA from thirty-three Brazilian samples. Our RFLP procedure classified thirty-two samples as single infections caused by viruses of subtypes B (31) and F (1), and one sample as dual infection caused by distinct viral strains. Subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the viral protease gene in lymphocytes of all these patients confirmed our RFLP findings in single infections, and demonstrated the existence of two distinct HIV-1 strains of subtypes F and D in a patient which lymphocytes showed the simultaneous presence of two different digestion patterns. As up to now, single infections caused by subtype D variants were not identified in Brazil, our data provide the first evidence of subtype D HIV-1 in this country. Because sequencing of HIV proviral DNA is not particularly practical for large-scale molecular epidemiological studies, the protease/gag-based RFLP screening method will be useful to predict the phylogroup of HIV-1, and to identify multiple infections caused by HIV-1 strains of distinct subtypes. We believe that this information is crucial for both evaluation of the HIV-1/AIDS pandemic and intervention strategies."

CD3, CD4, CD29, and CD45RA phenotypes were analyzed by two-color flow cytometry. Significant depletion of CD4+ T cells and both memory (CD4+/CD29+) and naive (CD4+/CD45RA+) T-cell subsets was found among SPCs and AIDS patients compared with the numbers of such cells in the HV and SNH groups. Responses to optimal doses of Candida albicans, streptokinase, and tetanus toxoid were explored in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4(+)- and CD4+/CD29(+)-enriched cell populations. In SPCs, the response to C. albicans in peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a statistically significant diminution compared with the response of HVs (15,308 versus 35,951 cpm). In addition, a significantly reduced response to streptokinase was evident only when cell preparations were CD4+/CD29+ enriched (3,048 versus 10,367 cpm). Furthermore, the SPC group comprised seven responders to at least one antigen and seven nonresponders to any of the selected specific antigens. Absence of a response in these latter patients was independent of the absolute counts of memory and naive T-cell populations. The response to tetanus toxoid, although diminished in SPCs, was not significantly different from that in controls. Our results suggest that defective responses to common environmental antigens, unrelated to the absolute number of CD4+/CD29+ cells, is probably an early indicator of an HIV-induced lymphocyte lesion."

The median baseline HIV-1 DNA level was 750 copies/10(6) PBMC. After initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-1 DNA levels decreased gradually, reaching a plateau from week 80 through week 104 (median HIV-1 DNA level, 263 copies/10(6) PBMC). Children who had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL after receiving HAART for 8 weeks (n=16) had persistently lower quantities of intracellular HIV-1 DNA than children whose HIV-1 RNA levels reached < 50 copies/mL after 8 weeks of HAART (n=15).

These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes.

About the course of the HCV infection, only 30% of patients with acute hepatitis get biochemical resolution, and 50-70% become carriers and have persistent chronic hepatitis or active chronic hepatitis. In this case, HCV infection showed an unusual acute and fatal course, it is possible that the impaired immune status of the patient could play a role in the acute course of the disease.

In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."

However, the relationship between immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV, characterized by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of serological markers, is unknown. We tested this in 113 anti-HCV-negative patients; 87 with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and 26 controls with hereditary glomerular nephropathies. All patients were serum HCV-RNA negative by conventional real-time PCR. Significantly, occult HCV-RNA (detectable viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in serum after ultracentrifugation) was found in 34 of 87 patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus 1 of 26 control patients. The serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with than in those without occult HCV (1.5 versus 1.1 mg/dl, respectively). A multivariate analysis adjusted for gender showed a significantly increased risk of occult HCV in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus the controls (odds ratio of 13.29). Progression to end-stage renal disease tended to be faster in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV than in the negative cases. Thus, occult HCV is strongly associated with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and may have a role in the progression of the disease."

Unfortunately, experimental models of HIV-induced reactivated TB are lacking. We examined whether cynomolgus macaques, which accurately model latent TB in humans, could be used to model pathogenesis of HIV infection in the lungs and associated lymph nodes. These experiments precede studies modeling the effects of HIV infection on latent TB. We infected two groups of macaques with chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIV-89.6P and SHIV-KU2) and followed viral titers and immunologic parameters including lymphocytes numbers and phenotype in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage cells, and lymph nodes over the course of infection. Tissues from the lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, and lymph nodes were similarly examined at necropsy. Both strains produced dramatic CD4(+) T cell depletion. Plasma titers were not different between viruses, but we found more SHIV-89.6P in the lungs. Both viruses induced similar patterns of cell activation markers. SHIV-89.6P induced more IFN-gamma expression than SHIV-KU2. These results indicate SHIV-89.6P and SHIV-KU2 infect cynomolgus macaques and may be used to accurately model effects of HIV infection on latent TB."

A retrospective survey of the prevalence of HBV infection in cryoglobulinemic patients was carried out in 596 cases of cryoglobulinemia. On the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria the cases were grouped as secondary to connective tissue disease, to lymphoproliferative disorders, to chronic liver diseases or to chronic infectious diseases. The cases in which an associated disease was not evidenced were considered as essential mixed cryogobulinemias. Subjects in which liver dysfunction was first diagnosed simultaneously with cryoglobulinemia, were considered as a separate group. A greater prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies was found in cryoglobulinemias secondary to chronic liver disease (p < 0.0001) and in those associated with liver involvement at diagnosis (p < 0.05) than that found in EMCs. The prevalence of anti-HBs antibodies did not differ significantly among the groups. Proven contact with the virus, documented by at least one positive marker, was evidenced more frequently in cryoglobulinemias secondary to liver disease than in the other groups (p < 0.01). The prevalence of HBV related markers in EMCs and in hospitalized patients not suffering from diseases associated with cryoglobulin production were similar, and seems to reflect the epidemiological situation of HBV infection in Italy. In conclusion, our findings do not support an association of HBV with EMC."

The reason for inadequate HIV/AIDS management among minority populations is not fully understood, however recent research indicates that patients rate the quality of their health care higher if they are racially/ethnically concordant with their providers. As trust plays prominently on health care ratings, we examined whether racial/ethnicity concordance was associated with two dimensions of trust, trust in the provider and mistrust in the health care system, in 380 HIV infected people New York City. In this sample, concordance was associated with lower mistrust in the health care system, but not with trust in provider. We conclude that in this patient population and within the health care system available to them, racial/ethnic concordance might be more important for helping patients to understand and navigate the health care system rather than in interpersonal relationships with a single provider."

The prevalence rates among volunteer blood donors were 0.02% and 0% for HTLV and HIV, respectively. Significantly increased HTLV prevalence rates were observed among paid blood donors, African American health care clinic patients, Amerindians, recipients of HTLV-positive cellular blood products, intravenous drug users, sexual contacts and family members of HTLV-positive people, and patients with primary thrombocytosis and other-than-low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Among some of these groups there were significant differences in the prevalence of HTLV-I versus HTLV-II. The eight HTLV-positive NHL patients all had mature, high-grade, CD4+ T-cell lymphomas with clonally integrated HTLV-I, for a prevalence of 4% among other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Seven of the eight died from their disease within 2 years despite treatment. Interestingly, two groups at risk for HTLV infection, namely needle stick victims and recipients of HTLV-infected and/or pooled plasma products, showed no evidence for infection. Significantly increased HIV-1 prevalence was observed among paid blood donors, African Americans, homosexuals, female prostitutes, hemophiliacs, and other-than-low-grade NHL patients. Only one patient was infected with HIV-2. Of the nine HIV-positive, other-than-low-grade NHL patients, seven HIV-1 positives had B-cell lymphomas, one HIV-1 positive had an HTLV-I-positive CD4+ T-cell lymphoma, and one infected with HIV-2 had a CD4+ T-cell lymphoma that was HTLV negative. The data indicate that HTLV-I lymphoma, while uncommon, is not necessarily rare among other-than-low-grade NHL cases in the United States and, given its poor prognosis, should probably be studied separately in clinical trials."

Blacks [odds ratio (OR) = 9.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.1-15.9] and Hispanics (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.9-8.8) were at increased risk of HIV-1 infection, relative to non-Hispanic whites. Those who lived closer to New York City, injected drugs more frequently, used intravenous drugs for a longer duration, used shooting galleries, had greater numbers of sexual partners, had human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibodies, and had the lowest annual incomes were also at increased risk. However, none of these other factors accounted for the black and Hispanic HIV-1 risk in stratified analysis. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, proximity to New York City, and number of drug injections in the past year each also remained significant, independent risk factors in a multivariate analysis. The increased HIV-1 risk of nonwhite IVDUs remained unexplained. Behavioral, sociologic, and/or biologic factors not identified in this study may modulate HIV-1 transmission dynamics in IVDUs."

2917,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Previous reports from India have been limited to the incidences of hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) in health and disease. This paper reports on a study undertaken over the last two years to determine the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection, the serotypes prevalent among apparently healthy individuals and patients with liver diseases, and the seasonal incidence of sporadic acute hepatitis in this geographic area. The incidences of infection in health and disease show an endemic pattern. The Y subtype predominates among healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases, whereas the D subtype predominates in patients with acute hepatitis. The similarity of subtypes of HB Ag among the majority of healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases suggests that the majority of asymptomatic carriers (subclinically infected) would develop chronic liver disease. The proportion of HB Ag-positive cases of acute hepatitis was significantly higher during the two summer seasons than during the two winter seasons; this could be due to more frequent transmission of the virus by the faecal/urinary-oral route and its activation during the summer months, especially in areas with poor hygienic conditions. The urinary/faecal excretion of virus could thus maintain the natural transmission of the virus in such an environment."

Design was a population-based case-control study. We randomly selected 150 case patients and 150 control patients whose AIDS diagnosis was made during 1994 to 1996 (male:female, 2:1) from among 19,238 persons reported to the NYC Health Department HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Case patients had died of AIDS-related causes in 1996. Control patients, category matched with case patients on gender, were not known to have died by the end of 1996. Analysis was performed on 279 patients (142 cases and 137 controls). Cases and controls were similar in age, gender, race, HIV transmission category, and health insurance coverage. The median baseline CD4 count was 30 cells/microL for those who died and 103 cells/microL for survivors (p < 0.001). The prescription of HAART (antiretroviral combination that includes at least one protease inhibitor) in 1996 was strongly associated with survival in univariate analysis (OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 2.5-10.2). This association remained in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, race, health insurance status, HIV transmission categories, year of AIDS diagnosis, baseline CD4 count, and other antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI = 3.5-20.7). Prescription of combination therapy other than HAART in 1996 and baseline CD4 count were also associated with survival, but less strongly so. The survival benefit of HAART extends beyond the confines of a few highly selected patients into the ""real world,"" reducing AIDS deaths at the population level. This population-based study supports the likelihood that the introduction of HAART in 1996 played a primary role in the decline in NYC AIDS mortality."

In contrast to reports of heterosexual transmission of subtype C HIV-1, in which the transmitted virus appears to be more neutralization sensitive, we demonstrate that in our study population, relatively few phenotypic changes in neutralization sensitivity or genotypic changes in envelope occurred during transmission of subtype B HIV-1. We suggest that limited genetic variation within the infecting host reduces the likelihood of selective transmission of neutralization-sensitive HIV."

However, given fatigue's pervasive effects on well-being and functioning, the identification of its physiologic and psychological causes and strategies to alleviate it are important to patients' quality of life. As part of a study to understand better how HIV-positive middle-aged and older adults (50+) manage common symptoms, 49 participants discussed in depth their experience with fatigue. Most engaged in both self-care activities and sought the assistance of a health care professional. Frequent strategies included dietary changes, vitamins, modification of routines, rest, exercise, and prescribed medications for anemia, Vitamin B(12) deficiency, or testosterone deficiency. Complementary and alternative medicine (e.g., acupuncture, massage, herbal remedies, special juices) was also commonly used. Participants often used multiple strategies to alleviate their fatigue, possibly because of their tendency to attribute it to multiple causes. These HIV-positive older adults were also apt to view fatigue as an indirect indicator of their overall health status and immune functioning. This may explain why many of the coping strategies they used could be considered approaches to improving their overall health status as a means to increasing their energy levels. Health care professionals can play an important role in helping HIV-positive individuals manage their fatigue. The majority of participants tried to implement the coping suggestions offered by health care professionals, as well as those from family, friends, and support group members."

This medical care has 5 main objectives: 1) Promotion of good health (through standard recommendation of hygiene, health habits and regular checkups); 2) prevention of infectious complications (through detection of latent pathogens, chemoprophylaxis, vaccination and avoidance of risky exposures); 3) Treatment of complications (mainly infectious, through early diagnosis and proper treatment); 4) Delay of HIV disease progression (through timely and properly chosen antiretroviral therapy); 5) Reduction of HIV infection spread from index case to others (through promotion of responsible behavior and avoidance of pregnancy and HIV exposure to others). Studies for evaluating global health and immunologic status and carriage of potential pathogens are discussed as well as the criteria and timing for chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis and P carinii pneumonia (PCP). Algorithms for the management of major clinical syndromes are presented: Diarrhea (afebrile, mostly parasitic, versus febrile, frequently bacterial); Pneumonia (lobar mostly bacterial versus interstitial, frequently PCP especially if lymphopenic and not receiving PCP prophylaxis); Brain mass lesion (most commonly toxoplasmosis).

PSS was defined using the MacArthur scale of subjective social status translated and adapted for the study setting. Socio-demographic and psychosocial correlates of PSS ranking at enrollment were determined using linear regression models. High versus low PSS was defined based on the median PSS score and evaluated as a determinant of body mass index, hemoglobin, quality of life (QOL) and frailty-related phenotype via linear regression. A log-binomial regression model estimated the relative-risk of good, very good or excellent versus fair or poor self-rated health (SRH) in relation to PSS. Older age, increasing social support and material wealth were correlated with high PSS ranking, whereas female sex, experience of multiple stigmas and multiple depressive symptoms were correlated with low PSS ranking. High PSS participants were on average 1.1 kg/m(2) heavier, had 4.7 % lower frailty scores and 3.6 % higher QOL scores compared to low PSS patients (all p < 0.05); they were also more likely to self-classify as high SRH (RR 1.4, 95 % confidence interval 1.1, 1.7) but had comparable hemoglobin levels (p = 0.634). Low PSS correlated with poor physical and psychosocial wellbeing in HIV-positive Ugandan adults. The assessment of PSS as part of clinical management, combined with efforts to reduce stigma and improve social support, may identify and possibly reduce PSS-associated health inequality in Ugandan adults with HIV."

We conducted a qualitative interview study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia in 2006. The aim of the study was to explore patients' and health care professionals' perceived barriers and facilitators to patients' adherence to ART. Based on data from individual interviews and focus group interviews with a total of 60 patients and 12 health care professionals, we identified barriers and facilitators related to patients' beliefs and behaviours, the health service, and socio-economic and cultural factors. Among the barriers we identified were lack of communication and information about ART, inadequate time during consultations, lack of follow-up and counselling, forgetfulness, stigma, discrimination and disclosure of HIV status, lack of confidentiality in the treatment centres, and lack of nutritional support. Feeling better, prospects of living longer, family support, information about ART, support for income-generating activities, disclosure of HIV status, prayers and transport support were among the facilitators. Our study suggests that several issues need to be considered when providing ART. Further research is needed to study interactions between patients and their health care providers. Our findings can inform interventions to improve adherence to ART."

Housing as a structural intervention for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS has been shown both to be feasible and to improve access to care. However, few studies report the impact of accessing stable housing on residents' viral load counts, even though viral load has been accepted as the best predictor of clinical prognosis for over a decade. The Open Door is a nonprofit agency that utilizes a harm reduction, housing first model of care to improve clinical outcomes for homeless people living with HIV. This article describes the first study that utilizes viral load to assess the effectiveness of a housing first approach. During the study period, we found that 69% of residents of The Open Door achieved undetectable viral loads, which far exceeds adherence rates ranging from 13 to 32% that were found in other studies of similar vulnerable populations. This finding supports the feasibility of this approach and its potential impact on reducing HIV morbidity, mortality, and secondary transmission. Given that the majority of the residents were active substance users during the study period and achieved undetectable viral loads, our findings also substantiate other studies demonstrating that substance users are able to maintain clinical adherence."

Because CTLs have not been identified in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) brains, the authors identified their cytotoxic granules in autopsy AIDS brains with HIVE and without HIVE (HIVnE) plus controls (7 to 13 cases/group) and determined gene expression profiles of CTL-associated genes in a separate series of cases. CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased (P < .01) in perivascular spaces and inflammatory nodules in HIVE but were rare or absent in brain parenchyma in HIVnE and control brains. Eight HIVE brains contained granzyme B+ T cells and five contained perforin+ T cells. Their T-cell origin was confirmed by colocalization of CD8 and granzyme B in the same cell and the absence of CD56+ natural killer cells. The CTLs directly contacted with neurons, as the authors showed previously for CD3+ and CD8+ T cells. CTLs were rare or absent in HIV nonencephalitis (HIVnE) and controls. Granzyme B and H precursor gene expression was up-regulated and interleukin (IL)-12A precursor, a maturation factor for natural killer cells and CTLs, was down-regulated in HIVE versus HIVnE brain. This study demonstrates, for the first time, CTLs in HIVE and shows that parenchymal T cells and CTLs are sensitive biomarkers for HIVE.

However, previous studies of factors associated with adherence to ART among IDU have been limited primarily to samples drawn from clinical settings and in areas with financial barriers to healthcare.We evaluated patterns of ART adherence and rates of plasma HIV RNA response among a Canadian cohort of community-recruited IDU. Using data from a community-recruited cohort of antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU, we investigated ART adherence patterns based on prescription refill compliance and factors associated with time to plasma HIV-1 RNA suppression (<500 copies/mL) using Cox proportional hazards regression in a setting with universal health care, including free ART. Between 1996 and 2008, 267 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected IDU initiated ART and had a median of 51 months (inter-quartile range: 17-95 months) of follow-up. Overall, 81 (30.3%) were ≥95% adherent during the first year of HAART and 187 (70.0%) achieved HIV RNA suppression at least once over the study period, for an incidence-density of 34.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.8-39.9) per 100 person-years. The Kaplan-Meier cumulative plasma HIV RNA suppression rates at 12 months after the initiation of ART were 80.8% (95% CI: 71.2-88.7) for adherent and 28.9% (95% CI: 22.8-36.1) for non-adherent participants. While several socio-demographic characteristics and drug-using behaviours were identified as barriers to successful treatment in unadjusted analyses, the factor most strongly associated with time to HIV RNA suppression in multivariate analysis was adherence to ART of at least 95% (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 6.0, 95% CI: 4.2-8.6, p<0.001). These results demonstrate low rates of adherence to ART among a community-recruited cohort of IDU and reinforce the importance of adherence as the key determinant of successful virological response to antiretroviral therapy."

We determined full-length pol gene over 20 years and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reviewed medical records. Eighteen HPs experienced various opportunistic infections or clinical manifestations. There were significant inverse correlations between the HLA prognostic score and the annual decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts prior to HAART (AD) (P < 0.05) and the amount of KRG and the AD (P < 0.01). From 1998, the HPs had been treated with HAART. Each of the two patients died without and with HAART regimen respectively. At present, 16 HPs have been alive with HAART. Among the 16 HPs, 12 and 4 are on HAART-plus-KRG and HAART only respectively. Eleven HPs including 2 HPs with G-to-A hypermutations had revealed resistance mutations. Ten and two HPs have shown poor adherence and incomplete viral suppres-sion on HAART respectively. Virological failure based on WHO guidelines was not observed on KRG-plus-HAART.

Because activated monocytes primarily use glucose to support cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection induces a hypermetabolic response with increased glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expression and glucose uptake by monocyte subpopulations in HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) treatment-naive individuals (n = 17), HIV(+) individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy with viral loads below detection (n = 11), and HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals (n = 16). Surface expression of Glut1 and cellular uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose were analyzed by flow cytometry on monocyte subpopulations. Irrespective of treatment status, monocytes from HIV(+) persons had significantly increased surface expression of Glut1 compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) and intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocyte subpopulations showed higher Glut1 expression than did classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes. Intermediate monocytes from treatment-naive HIV(+) individuals also showed increased uptake of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Our results show that HIV infection is associated with increased glucose metabolism in monocytes and that Glut1 expression by proinflammatory monocytes is a potential marker of inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. However, the possibility exists whereby other Gluts such as Glut3 and Glut4 may also support the influx of glucose into activated and inflammatory monocyte populations. "

Thus, a potential anti-viral strategy is to target the host metabolic factors necessary for HBV gene expression and replication. Recent studies revealed that fatty acid translocase CD36 is involved in the replication, assembly, storage, and secretion of certain viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the relationship between CD36 and the HBV life cycle remains unclear. Here, we showed, for the first time, that increased CD36 expression enhances HBV replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. To understand the underlying molecular basis, we performed genome-wide sequencing of the mRNA from HepG2.2.15-CD36 overexpression (CD36OE) cells and HepG2.2.15-vector cells using RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq) technology to analyze the differential transcriptomic profile. Our results identified 141 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to CD36 overexpression, including 79 upregulated genes and 62 downregulated genes. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that some of the DEGs were involved in various metabolic processes and the HBV life cycle. The reliability of the RNA-Seq data was confirmed by qPCR analysis. Our findings provide clues to build a link between CD36, host metabolism and the HBV life cycle and identified areas that require further investigation."

This deletion causes a frameshift generating a premature stop codon at (64) Asn in the HBV core gene (codon 93 in the precore gene), that truncates the precore protein, precursor of the secreted hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg), and the core protein which forms the viral nucleocapsid. However, the replication phenotype of the -1G mutant HBV is unknown. An in vitro cell culture model in which hepatoma cells were transiently transfected with infectious cDNAs was used to show that the -1G mutant HBV is incapable of autonomous replication and, as expected, replication was restored to wild-type (wt) levels by supplying HBV core protein in trans. Although the -1G mutation had no deleterious effect on intracellular HBV-DNA levels, high levels of -1G mutant HBV relative to wt HBV reduced virus secretion and HBeAg secretion relative to empty vector controls. Importantly, the -1G mutant HBV also caused intracellular retention of truncated precore protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Together, these effects may be contributing to the increased pathology observed in the setting of HIV/HBV co-infection."

However, the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif remains unknown and needs to be further determined. In this report, we show that, like many other proteins encoded by HIV-1, Vif proteins possess a strong tendency toward self-association. In relatively native conditions, Vif proteins formed multimers in vitro, including dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Through in vivo binding assays such as coimmunoprecipitation and the mammalian two-hybrid system, we also demonstrated that Vif proteins could interact with each other within a cell, indicating that the multimerization of Vif proteins is not simply due to fortuitous aggregation. Further studies indicated that the domain affecting Vif self-association is located at the C terminus of this protein, especially the proline-enriched 151-164 region. Moreover, we found that a Vif mutant with deletion at amino acid 151-164 was unable to rescue the infectivity of vif-defective viruses generated from H9 T-cells, suggesting that the multimerization of Vif proteins could be important for Vif function in the viral life cycle. Our studies identified a new feature of Vif and should accelerate our understanding of its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."

It is incorporated into selenoproteins as the amino acid selenocysteine and it is known to inhibit the expression of some viruses. In this study, we show that selenium supplementation for 3 days prior to exposure to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) partially suppresses the induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in both chronically infected T lymphocytic and monocytic cell lines. In acute HIV-1 infection of T lymphocytes and monocytes in the absence of exogenous TNF-alpha, the suppressive effect of selenium supplementation was not observed. However, selenium supplementation did suppress the enhancing effect of TNF-alpha on HIV-1 replication in vitro in acutely infected human monocytes, but not in T lymphocytes. Selenium supplementation also increased the activities of the selenoproteins, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), which serve as cellular antioxidants. Taken together, these results suggest that selenium supplementation may prove beneficial as an adjuvant therapy for AIDS through reinforcement of endogenous antioxidative systems."

Th17 cells initiate immune‑mediated pathogenesis and have a critical role in the process of HBV‑related liver cirrhosis (HBV‑LC). The mechanisms underlying this process are attributed to Th17‑secreted cytokines, which include interleukin (IL)‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22; however, a systemic analysis regarding these mechanisms has yet to be conducted. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC. All randomized clinical trials, case series, case reports and meta‑analyses that contained the aforementioned keywords were included in the review process. In addition, unpublished information from the Food and Drug Administration was included. The findings indicated that Th17‑secreted cytokines, including IL‑17, IL‑21 and IL‑22, function by activating or silencing hepatic stellate cells, modulating proinflammatory and pro‑ or antifibrogenic effectors, regulating extracellular matrix formation, upregulating chemokine expression, and inducing hepatocellular damage or hepatoprotection during the HBV‑LC process. In addition, Th17 cells and Th17‑secreted cytokines may be considered a potential tool in the diagnosis or treatment of HBV‑LC. The present review summarized the role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of HBV‑LC in order to deepen the clinical understanding of the role of Th17 cells and also to support the development of effective therapies for patients with HBV‑LC."

However, infection was subject to individual variations even in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which appeared to increase the amounts of viral DNA associated with the cells. In this study, we have defined conditions which enhance hepatitis B virus penetration into the cells, and we show that, under these conditions, infection of hepatocytes is always possible, regardless of their individual origin. We have found that addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the cultures maintained in the presence of 2% DMSO at the time of infection markedly increased the infection process and made it highly reproducible. Moreover, both the tissue and species specificity were preserved. This increased HBV infection was correlated to increased amount of internalized HBV DNA and to enhanced attachment of the virions. From these results it may be assumed that PEG could favor a better interaction between virions and cells, resulting in an activated internalization of bound viral particles. Data also show that adult human hepatocyte primary cultures, which are not equally susceptible to HBV infection, are consistently capable of viral replication when the viral genome has entered the cells. This suggests that the main limitation of the in vitro HBV infection lies in the ability of human hepatocytes to specifically bind the viral particles."

It is known as idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia and rarely occurs in immunosuppressed patients who are not infected by HIV. We describe a case of persistent idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia in an HIV-negative 65-year-old woman. At autopsy, polymerase chain reaction analysis evidenced JC virus DNA in kidney, brain and liver although there were no signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or evidence of oligodendrocyte infection. While her disease was not HIV-induced, it closely resembled AIDS in terms of the nature of the immune derangement and the clinical picture. The case also evidences the reactivation of JC virus infection in non-HIV-related immunosuppression in cerebral and/or extracerebral sites: liver infection seems to be particularly relevant since it has not yet been recognized as a common target of JC virus infection or a source of virus spreading. The absence of any sign of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy was remarkable: histological examination failed to disclose demyelination or other progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy changes, and the search for JC virus DNA with in situ methods also gave negative results. The lack of lytic brain infection in this case would seem to support the hypothesis that the expression of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is directly dependent on the presence of HIV infection."

Typically, however, the virus evolves mutations in the RT gene that circumvent the drugs. We develop a mathematical model for this situation. The model distinguishes quiescent from activated CD4+ T cells, incorporates the fact that only activated cells can become productively infected by HIV-1, embodies empirical estimates for the drug resistance and the mutation frequency for each of the HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants, and assumes the antiviral immune response to remain constant over the course of the experiments. We analyze clinical data on the evolution of drug-resistant mutants for the RT inhibitors lamivudine and zidovudine. The results show that the evolutionary sequence of the drug-resistant mutants in both data sets is accounted for by our model, given that lamivudine is more effective than zidovudine. Thus, current empirical estimates of the mutation frequencies and the drug resistances of the mutants suffice for explaining the data. We derive a critical treatment level below which the wild-type HIV-1 RNA load can rebound before the first drug-resistant mutant appears. Our zidovudine data confirm this to be the case. Thus, we demonstrate in the model and the data that the rebound of the HIV-1 RNA load in the case of zidovudine is due to the outgrowth of wild-type virus and the first drug-resistant mutant, whereas that in the case of lamivudine can only be due to the drug-resistant mutants. The evolution of drug resistance proceeds slower in the case of zidovudine because (i) zidovudine is not as effective as lamivudine and (ii) the first zidovudine drug-resistant mutant is competing with the rebounding wild-type virus."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common etiologic agent of HCC in the world, particularly in areas prevalent for HBV infection such as Asia, Africa, southern part of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Middle East. Risk factors of HBV-related HCC include (1) viral factors-persistent high viral replication, HBV genotype C or D, pre-S2 or core promoter mutants; (2) host factors-older age (>40 years old) at HBeAg seroconversion, male gender; (3) mother-to-infant transmission; and (4) other carcinogenic factors-smoking, habitual use of alcohol, etc. Prevention is the best way to control cancer. There are three levels of liver cancer prevention, i.e., primary prevention by HBV vaccination targeting the general population, secondary prevention by antiviral agent for high-risk subjects with chronic HBV infection, and tertiary prevention by antiviral agent to prevent recurrence for patients who have been successfully treated for liver cancer. Primary prevention by hepatitis B vaccination is most cost effective. Its cancer preventive efficacy supports it as the first successful example of cancer preventive vaccine in human. This experience can be extended to the development of other cancer preventive vaccine. Careful basic and clinical research is needed to develop ideal vaccines to induce adequate protection. Understanding the main transmission route and age at primary infection may help to set the optimal target age to start a new cancer preventive vaccination program. Besides timely HBV vaccination, the earlier administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately after birth, and even antiviral agent during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV are possible strategies to enhance the prevention efficacy of HBV infection and its related liver cancer.

Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015.

These patients tend to have a faster progression of hepatic fibrosis. This cross-sectional study describes the demographic features and clinical profile of human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis co-infected patients in Paraná, Southern Brazil. A total of 93 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients attending a tertiary care academic hospital in Southern Brazil were included. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data were evaluated. Hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus positive serology was found in 6.6% of patients. The anti-hepatitis C virus serum test was positive in 85% (79/93) of patients, and the infection was confirmed in 72% of the cases. Eighteen patients (19%) were human immunodeficiency virus/hepatitis B virus positive (detectable HBsAg). Among co-infected patients, there was a high frequency of drug use, and investigations for the detection of co-infection were conducted late. A low number of patients were eligible for treatment and, although the response to antiretroviral therapy was good, there was a very poor response to hepatitis therapy. Our preliminary findings indicate the need for protocols aimed at systematic investigation of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, thus allowing for early detection and treatment of co-infected patients.

Fifteen neonates were inoculated with the W8 strain of WHV. In 11, infection was resolved, and 4 became chronic carriers. Nineteen neonates were inoculated with the W7 strain and all became chronic carriers. Seven age-matched uninfected woodchucks served as controls. Virologic and vCMI profiles among the W8 and W7 infections were compared and related to the outcome of infection. Resolving woodchucks had robust, acute-phase vCMI to WHV antigens (core, surface, and x) and to several nonoverlapping core peptides. The acute-phase vCMI was associated temporally with the clearance of viral DNA and of surface antigen from serum at 14 to 22 weeks postinfection. In contrast, in approximately half of the W8 and W7 infections that progressed to chronicity, no significant acute-phase vCMI was detected. In the remaining carriers, acute-phase vCMI was observed, but it was less frequent and incomplete compared to that of resolved woodchucks. Serum viral load developed less rapidly in those carriers that had evidence of acute-phase vCMI, but it was still increased compared to that of resolving woodchucks. Thus, vigorous and multispecific acute-phase vCMI was associated with resolution of neonatal WHV infection. Absent or incomplete acute-phase vCMI was associated with the progression to chronic infection. By analogy, these results suggest that the onset of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans may be associated with deficiencies in the primary T-cell response to acute HBV infection."

Whereas determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase important for replication in T lymphocytes have been extensively characterized, regions of the att site important for viral spread have not been thoroughly examined. Previous transposon-mediated footprinting of preintegration complexes isolated from infected cells revealed enhanced regions of bacteriophage Mu insertion near the ends of HIV-1 cDNA, in the regions of the att sites. Here, we identified the subterminal cDNA sequences cleaved during in vitro footprinting and used this structure-based information together with results of previous work to construct and characterize 24 att site mutant viruses. We found that although subterminal cDNA sequences contributed to HIV-1 replication, the identities of these bases were not critical for integration. In contrast, the phylogenetically conserved CA dinucleotides located at the ends of HIV-1 contributed significantly to virus replication and integration. Mutants containing one intact CA end displayed delays in peak virus growth compared to the wild type. In contrast, double mutant viruses lacking both CAs were replication defective. The A of the CA appeared to be the most critical determinant of integration, because two different U5 mutant viruses containing the substitution of TG for CA partially reverted by changing the G back to A. We also identified a U5 deletion mutant in which the CA played a crucial role in reverse transcription."

An understudied therapeutic target is HIV integrase, an essential enzyme that mediates integration of the HIV genome into the host chromosome. The dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQAs) and the dicaffeoyltartaric acids (DCTAs) have potent activity against HIV integrase in vitro and prevent HIV replication in tissue culture. However, their specificity against HIV integrase in cell culture has been questioned. Thus, the ability of the DCQAs and DCTAs to inhibit binding of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 to CD4 and their activities against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HIV RNase H were studied. The DCQAs and DCTAs inhibited HIV-1 integrase at concentrations between 150 and 840 nM. They inhibited HIV replication at concentrations between 2 and 12 microM. Their activity against reverse transcriptase ranged from 7 microM to greater than 100 microM. Concentrations that inhibited gp120 binding to CD4 exceeded 80 microM. None of the compounds blocked HIV-1 RNase H by 50% at concentrations exceeding 80 microM. Furthermore, when the effects of the DCTAs on reverse transcription in acutely infected cells were measured, they were found to have no activity. Therefore, the DCQAs and DCTAs exhibit > 10- to > 100-fold specificity for HIV integrase, and their activity against integrase in biochemical assays is consistent with their observed anti-HIV activity in tissue culture. Thus, the DCQAs and DCTAs are a potentially important class of HIV inhibitors that act at a site distinct from that of current HIV therapeutic agents."

Preinfection of MDM with M. tuberculosis followed by HIV-1 infection resulted in an increase in p24 release, reverse transcriptase activity, and infective virus production. In contrast, no increase in HIV-1 production was observed when MDM were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex or heat-killed M. tuberculosis. Coinfected MDM were potent stimulators of T cell proliferation, while HIV-1-infected MDM failed to present exogenous tuberculin to T cells. Furthermore, coinfected MDM showed an increased capacity to transmit HIV-1 to activated T cells. These results suggest that M. tuberculosis infection can both up-regulate HIV-1 infection and replication within MDM and increase the efficiency of virus transmission from infected MDM to T cells."

The sustained HBeAg seroconversion rate in patients who have received 100 mg lamivudine rate increase from 17% at year one to 27% after 2 years. Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis.

Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."

Here, we report for the first time a patient with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis who emerged with virologic breakthrough during combination therapy with TDF and entecavir (ETV), against ETV-resistant virus. A 51-year-old Japanese woman with hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), whose genotype was C, received ETV monotherapy continuously followed by TDF and ETV combination therapy, because her HBV DNA levels had been >3.5 log copies/mL. At the start of combination therapy, amino acid substitutions of the reverse transcriptase (rt) gene, rtL180M, rtT184I/M, and rtM204V, were detected. After this, serum HBV DNA decreased to less than 2.1 log copies/mL and remained at this level until 31 months of combination therapy, when it again began to increase. Amino acid substitutions of rtL180M, rtS202G, and rtM204V emerged and were associated with an increase in serum HBV DNA at virologic breakthrough. Long-term therapy with TDF against the ETV-resistant virus has the potential to induce virologic breakthrough and resistance, and careful follow-up should be carried out. "

In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase."

Multiple logistic regression identified associations between anti-HBc and older age, family members with chronic hepatitis, job category and history of transfusion before 1992. HBsAg(+) was associated with older age and history of transfusion before 1992. None of the risk/prognostic factors had sufficient sensitivity and specificity for HBV but report of at least one risk factor identified all HCV(+) cases. Anti-HCV screening of those with at least two parenteral risk factors not only identified all anti-HCV(+) cases but also resulted in 86% decrease in the screening cost.

The response rate was 51 per cent, and the final usable sample was 451. Variables examined were: demographic characteristics, the number of HIV-infected patients, personal contact with people living with HIV or AIDS, personal contact with homosexuals, the degree of anxiety about HIV or AIDS, and the degree of HIV-related discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes among general practitioners decreased as contact with HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001), other people living with HIV or AIDS (P < 0.001), and homosexuals (P < 0.001) increased. Anxiety about HIV or AIDS also decreased as contact increased (P < 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were strongly associated with higher levels of HIV-related discrimination (P < 0.001). The demographic correlates of discrimination among general practitioners were the same as those found in the wider population. The professional care of people living with HIV and AIDS was concentrated among a small number of general practitioners, many of whom were homosexual. Ten general practitioners were carrying extraordinarily high caseloads of over 200 HIV-infected patients each. Older, heterosexual and male general practitioners are an important target for education campaigns, and the professional care of people living with HIV or AIDS should be encouraged among a wider group of general practitioners."

Integrating HIV and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and care will, at least in part, reduce missed opportunities for implementing NCD prevention in HIV-infected people in care."

Data collected included age group, race/ethnicity, syphilis serologic results and self-admitted drug use. Remnant serum specimens were tested for HIV-1 antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot. Of 2236 inmates surveyed, 413 (18.5%) were HIV-1 positive. Rates varied by subgroup, and were higher for women than men (25.8 versus 16.1%; odds ratio 1.8; P less than 0.01), for drug users than inmates who denied drug use (25 versus 14%; odds ratio 2.3; P less than 0.01), for intravenous heroin users (43 versus 15% in drug users not using heroin), and for inmates with positive rapid plasma reagin test (RPR) results (34.5 versus 16.1% in RPR-negative inmates). Use of intravenous heroin was most strongly related, by logistic regression, to HIV-1 seropositivity. The results are among the highest found in US inmates, and suggest that there were 12,500 seropositive individuals incarcerated in 1989. This represents approximately 10% of the estimated number of seropositive individuals in NYC. The NYC Correctional System should be viewed as a front-line institution in the fight against AIDS through provision of HIV-related prevention services and clinical care, and drug treatment."

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary burn care hospital in Iran, retrospectively reviewing the data records of all patients admitted between February 2011 and February 2012. The HIV status of all the patients was assessed in relation to clinical outcomes and the patient's prognosis. A total of 969 patients were included in this study. Five patients (0·5%) were HIV positive, and all of them were male. Mean burn area was significantly larger in HIV-positive patients than the healthy group (P < 0·05). HIV-positive patients had a longer period of hospitalisation than HIV-negative patients (23·2 ± 16·3 versus 13·1 ± 14·6, P = 0·008). Nonetheless, the average number of procedures and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between the study groups (P > 0·05). Comparison of age, sex and burn extent between HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative cases also revealed similar results. Prevalence of HIV infection among our burn population was 0·5%; thus, HIV status may be related with more extensive injuries and longer hospital stays."

Sera were tested with a second generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and positive samples were retested by a confirmatory assay (line immunoassay). All children attending day care centers were anti-HCV negative. Only one (0.2%) adolescent was positive in the student group. However, higher positivity was found in street youths; four (1.0%) living at home and three (3.0%) living in the streets and anti-HCV antibodies. Among these, the prevalence of anti-HCV increased significantly with age from 0% in the 9-12-year-old group to 6.9% in the 17-20-year-old group. Risk factors including blood transfusion, tattooing, intravenous drug use, and sexual intercourse with multiple partners were significantly associated with the presence of anti-HCV in street youths. These results indicate that apparently healthy children and adolescents attending day care centers or primary schools in central Brazil have a low exposure to HCV infection, but street youths in the same area are at risk for infection with this virus."

Effective vaccines are available since over 10 years, but many HCWs are not aware of the risk of infection and are still not immunized against hepatitis B. This study aimed to assess immunization coverage against hepatitis B among the students of the University of Health Sciences (UHS) of Lao PDR in 2013 and to look for the causes of non-vaccination. A cross-sectional survey was conducted by self-administered questionnaire on a representative stratified sample of each academic year in each faculty. In total, 961 questionnaires were collected, Basic Sciences: 143, Medicine: 167, Pharmacy: 148, Dentistry: 139, Nursing Sciences: 159, Medical Technology: 99, and Postgraduate Studies: 106. Respondents were predominantly female (59.1%), mean age 25.1±7.0 years, single (76.3%), from the provinces (68.0%), of the Lao Loum ethnic group (84.4%). Among them, 21% were fully vaccinated against hepatitis B and 9.5% partially. Immunization coverage rates were significantly higher among women (p=0.01), students aged over 25 years, married or belonging to the post-graduate faculty (p<0.001). The most common reason (38.6%) given for non-vaccination was not knowing where to get vaccinated. Knowledge about hepatitis B, scored from 0 to 5, was poor (0-1) for 86.5% of the students, but 77.5% were aware of the hepatitis B vaccine. The knowledge scores were significantly higher for students aged over 25 years, married or post-graduated (p<0.001). Vaccination coverage against hepatitis B is dramatically low among students of health professions in Laos, largely because of their lack of knowledge and awareness. Upon admission to the University, all future HCWs should receive information about the occupational risks of blood-borne viruses transmission and be encouraged to get vaccinated against hepatitis B.

We also aimed to compare the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear tests for patients with HIV using sputum cultures as the gold standard. A cross-section study was conducted among adult patients (> or = 18 years old) with prolonged cough (greater than two weeks), night sweats, fever, and/or weight loss suspected of pulmonary TB between February and March 2006. Sputum samples were obtained and processed for 165 patients; 53 (32.1%) were culture positive for TB. Patients with TB were predominantly male (92.1%), young (median age of 32 years), and the HIV-seroprevalence was high (41.5%). In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age, HIV infection was significantly associated (POR = 2.0, p < 0.05) with the presence of TB disease. Among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates recovered from 53 cases, 25 (47.2%) were resistant to > or = 1 first line anti-TB drugs and 7 (13.2%) were MDR-TB. The sensitivity of AFB smears among HIV negative and positive participants was 35.5% and 18.0%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that the sensitivity of AFB smears to detect TB among HIV positive patients was low. Additionally, we found that even in regions where population drug resistance estimates are low, sentinel surveillance of MDR-TB in high-risk populations is useful to prioritize target groups in need of additional prevention, monitoring and health outreach."
987,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Cell-mediated immune responses constitute a major defense against the spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, multiple alterations within a particular epitope may accumulate during disease progression, allowing the virus to escape cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Therefore, the best candidate for a peptide vaccine that would prevent the onset of the disease might be a chain section containing epitopes for the generation of CTLs in regions of conserved sequences among different HIV-1 isolates. We previously showed that immunizing mice with synthetic peptides consisting of 23-amino acids (Gag-23mer; 287-309 amino acid residues) in a highly conserved region derived from the major core protein p24 of HIV-1 generates specific CTLs as well as antibodies. Here, we identified one CTL (T-1; 291-300) and two B-cell (B-1; 290-299 and B-2; 300-309) epitopes, all of which consisted of 10 amino acids within the region. In addition, helper T cells primed by the Gag-23mer peptide were proliferated by in vitro stimulation with a 21mer (H-1; 289-309) or a 19mer (H-2; 291-309) peptide, but not with a 17mer peptide (293-309) or 19mer peptide (287-305). Immunization with the H-1 peptide generated an antibody reactive to B-1, but not B-2, whereas that with H-2 generated an antibody reactive to B-2, but not B-1. CTLs were not generated by immunization with these peptides, indicating that the entire sequence of Gag-23mer is the helper epitope for CTLs. Thus, the Gag-23mer is a chain section containing epitopes for cytotoxic T, B and helper T-cells within a highly conserved region of HIV-1 Gag protein."

In developed countries, nearly 30% of new HIV diagnoses occurred at advanced stages of the disease, and it is important because advanced HIV disease has been associated with worse clinical outcomes, including lower rates of virological response, higher morbidity, and higher mortality. However, there are scarce data regarding which is the best antiretroviral regimen in these patients. Nowadays, integrase inhibitor-based regimens are widely recommended as the best initial therapy for treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients by all international guidelines. However, these guidelines hardly mention the recommended regimens in individuals with advanced HIV disease. Otherwise, recent data indicating a higher risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated to the use of integrase inhibitors have raised concerns on the use of these drugs in patients with advanced HIV disease. The aim of this article is to review the available evidence from randomized clinical trials for the best treatment in patients with advanced HIV disease."

These long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) exhibit lower viral loads and stable CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The immunologic basis for this disease-free condition is not known. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) constitute a major immune defense mechanism for sustained recovery from viral infections, we analyzed HIV-specific CTL responses in three asymptomatic LTNPs. We observed the presence of HIV-1 envelope-specific CTL responses mediated by HLA class I C-restricted CD8+ cells in these individuals. Using autologous target cells and a panel of HLA-matching and -mismatching B-cell lines as targets, we determined that HLA-Cw7 is the restricting element for the observed CTL activity. Additionally, we identified three peptides, one previously not reported, from conserved regions in the envelope protein as CTL epitopes. We previously reported these peptides to be efficient in inducing HIV-specific cellular immune responses in murine and nonhuman primate models. Our results support the role of the HLA-C locus in generating CTL responses and constitute the first report of an HLA-Cw7-restricted HIV-1 envelope-specific CTL response in HIV+ LTNPs, which may be important in the control of HIV replication in vivo."

Of HIV-1-infected donors from various clinical categories 90% (27/30) had sensitized cells that proliferated in response to at least one of 21 HIV peptides tested. Cells from HIV seronegative controls did not proliferate (0/9) in response to these HIV peptides. Individuals with fewer clinical manifestations of HIV-1 disease responded to a greater number of peptides (average for asymptomatic seropositives = 8.1 peptides; AIDS patients averaged 2.0). The number of peptides recognized also correlated with absolute number of CD4+ cells, but not with delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity to a (non-HIV) battery of Ag. However, clinical stage at no time correlated with the response to any particular peptide. Response patterns differed considerably among individuals, and some peptides stimulated proliferation in many (48%) HIV-infected donors (peptides gp41-2 and pol-3), whereas another peptide elicited no T cell response in any donor tested (peptide gp120-8). We have also begun to investigate the basis for individual heterogeneity of T lymphocyte proliferative responses of HIV-infected donors to the 21 HIV synthetic peptides. Peptide structure and HLA class II determinants both influenced patterns of lymphocyte responses. Reactivity correlated with peptide size, the presence of alpha and beta secondary structure and lack of reverse turn potential. Hydropathy and charge had no predictive value. Peptides derived from HIV sequences that vary highly among strains tended to be recognized less frequently. HIV-infected lymphocyte donors were HLA typed to examine the influence of the MHC on T lymphocyte proliferation. Analysis of the frequencies of individuals reacting to specific peptides, when compared to the allele frequencies in the population at large, indicated association of some responses to DR alleles. More DR association was observed with peptides that showed ""moderate"" reactivity than with those that were ""highly"" reactive. We suggest that highly reactive peptides are capable of forming a structure closer to an ""ideal"" T cell epitope that can associate with many DR alleles. In contrast, ""moderately"" reactive determinants have less favorable structures for interaction, are more limited in their ability to interact and therefore show more restriction to specific class II alleles."

Multiple neuromuscular diseases were observed, including tropical spastic paraparesis, polymyositis, and polyneuropathies. Only one patient developed AIDS. HIV-1 infected patients with HTLV-I, but not HTLV-II, coinfection have maintained stable CD4 counts, despite the fact that quantitative HIV DNA PCR suggests a relatively high copy number. HTLV-I/II antigens were detected in lymphocyte cultures from four patients, and lymphoblastoid cell lines have been established from two.

The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."

Perforin and TIA-1-positive cells were detected in the follicles and paracortex of lymph nodes from HIV-infected patients, whereas labelling was seen only in cells of the paracortex in the hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV-negative patients. Cytotoxic granules, staining positive for perforin and TIA-1, were identified by transmission electronmicroscopy, often in proximity to follicular dendritic cells within the hyperplastic germinal centres of only HIV-positive patients. These cytotoxic cells may play a role in the follicular dendritic cell loss and concomitant follicular involution that occur during the evolution of HIV disease."

Greater understanding of local STI burdens can assist in the development of more effective STI and HIV prevention strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and incidence of STIs among South Indian men and women identified to be at increased risk for HIV infection. Individuals at increased risk for HIV infection were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study in Chennai, India (n = 480) between August 2002 and December 2003. Participants were enrolled from patients seeking services at an sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic and a confidential HIV testing and counseling program. The most common prevalent STIs were herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 (50% of women, 29% of men), syphilis (11% of women, 8% of men), and Trichomonas vaginalis (6% of women). At enrollment, women, participants with no schooling, participants with greater than four sex partners, and single participants were found to be at increased risk for HSV-2 infection (p < 0.05). The two most common incident STIs at 12 months were HSV-2 with 12% of men and 8% of women testing positive and hepatitis B with 2% of men and 5% of women testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. In this cohort of South Indian men and women with a high background prevalence of HSV-2, suppressive therapy against herpes replication may have a substantial impact in reducing both HSV-2 transmission and HIV acquisition. With the high incidence of STIs, targeted prevention and clinical management strategies among individuals practicing high risk behaviors may help to slow the continued spread of HIV in India."

The viral dynamic and immunologic responses of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to daily interferon therapy were characterized in twelve patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Three out of the twelve patients (25%) achieved an early viral response, a two-log reduction in HCV RNA by week 12. The mean epsilon of IFN-alpha in blocking HCV and HIV production were 72% and 74%, respectively. For HCV epsilon was highest (97%) in the one patient who had a sustained viral response, while it was reduced in the other two patients (68% and 77%). Baseline HCV RNA and the number of CD3+CD56+16+ cells were inversely related (r = -0.89, p = 0.03), and baseline HCV-specific immune responses were significantly higher in the three patients with 2-log viral load reductions. These data suggest that: 1) interferon efficacy at blocking virion production is correlated with treatment outcome in HIV/HCV co-infected patients, 2) that immunodeficient patients can respond to standard IFN-alpha, 3) that both innate and adaptive immune responses may be important determinants of HCV RNA decline in response to interferon."

The tendency of purified virions to release their extracellular gp120 component, either spontaneously or after interacting with soluble CD4 (CD4-induced shedding) was assessed. A single amino acid substitution in part of the CD4 binding site of gp120 (Gly-427 to Arg) enhanced both spontaneous and CD4-induced shedding of gp120 from virions, while a single change in the fusogenic region of gp41 (Met-7 to Val) affected only CD4-induced shedding. Although each codon change alone conferred increased growth ability, virus with both mutations exhibited the most rapid replication kinetics. In addition, when both of these mutations were present, virions had the highest tendency to shed gp120, both spontaneously and after exposure to soluble CD4. Analysis of CD4 binding to virion-associated gp120 showed that the changes in both gp120 and gp41 contributed to increased binding. These results demonstrated that the increased replicative capacity of the ELI variants in human CD4+ cell lines was associated with altered physical and functional properties of the virion envelope glycoproteins."

This was increased in a dose-dependent manner in the control groups consisting of healthy blood donors and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In contrast, PMNLs from the HIV and HIV/TB groups responded reciprocally in the same assay; that is, higher IL-8 input concentrations resulted in the release of less enzyme than lower IL-8 input concentrations. The degranulation response of PMNLs from HIV-1-infected individuals was similarly altered for another agonist, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, suggesting that impairment of the nonoxidative armature of PMNL was a more generalized phenomenon. However, impaired IL-8-induced degranulation was found to be associated with the reduced expression of both IL-8 receptors, A and B, on whole-blood PMNLs from HIV-1-infected patients compared with that on whole-blood PMNLs from healthy persons. The density of IL-8RA, in particular, was most reduced on the surfaces of PMNLs from those patients with the poorest degranulation in response to IL-8. Inefficient agonist-induced degranulation may contribute to the increased susceptibility of HIV-1-infected persons to secondary microbial infections, this being further exacerbated in HIV/TB patients who, in addition, display defects in phagocytosis and oxidative burst."

Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can control viral replication, but it is unable to restore HIV-specific immunity. Newer approaches for managing HIV infection are focusing on cell-mediated immune responses, including the potential for improved immunologic control over HIV replication. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-12, are being evaluated for their ability to enhance cell-mediated immunity, which is thought to be critical for immunologic control. Initial studies with IL-2 have demonstrated an improvement in CD4 cell counts, and large randomized trials are underway to determine the long-term clinical efficacy of IL-2 in combination with antiretroviral therapy, including HAART. Stimulating the immune response against HIV by use of exogenous (therapeutic vaccination) or endogenous (structured treatment interruption) antigens with or without immune adjuvants or cytokines, such as IL-2, is another approach currently being explored."

Production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1 beta was monitored between days 3 and 26 after MDM infection. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected in cell culture supernatants from days 16 to 21 following HIV-1/DAS, HIV-1/PAR and HIV-1/Ba-L infection, at the time of high viral replication. IL-1 beta was not found at the same time points. TNF-alpha mRNA expression occurred around the peak of both TNF-alpha levels and supernatant RT activities. In HIV-1/THI-infected macrophage cultures no endogenously produced TNF-alpha was observed, despite high levels of HIV-1 in MDM. This result demonstrates that a primary isolate may replicate independently of TNF-alpha in MDM. To investigate the relationship between TNF-alpha and viral replication we used a TNF-alpha synthesis inhibitor, RP 55778. Treatment throughout the course of cell culture resulted in a significant decrease in both TNF-alpha levels and viral production in HIV-1/DAS-, HIV-1/PAR- and HIV-1/Ba-L-infected MDM cultures. This phenomenon is reversed by adding recombinant human TNF-alpha to the RP 55778-treated cell cultures from day 14 post-infection. No effect of RP 55778 was observed in MDM cultures infected with the primary isolate HIV-1/THI, whose replication is independent of TNF-alpha production and therefore remained unchanged after RP 55778 treatment. We conclude that the clinical value of such a drug is directly dependent on the ability of the HIV-1 strains involved to induce TNF-alpha production at the time of viral replication."

We examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on the cytokine and chemokine responses of peripheral blood-derived CD8(+) T cells in an in vitro system. Activation of HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cells with phytohemagglutinin resulted in a 4- to 8-fold increase in the production of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, and interleukin (IL)-16. Treatment of activated HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal (M) antibody (Ab) and IL-15 induced strong production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Treatment of cells with anti-IL-12 MAb and IL-4 to induce a Tc1-to-Tc2 shift resulted in no change in viral production levels or IFN-γ production within the HIV-1-infected CD8(+) T cell population. Initiation of a Tc2-to-Tc1 shift resulted in a 6-fold increase in HIV-1 replication and 2- to 3-fold higher levels of IFN-γ, demonstrating that infection can protect against a Tc1-to-Tc2 shift in CD8(+) T cells."

The rate-limiting enzyme for this pathway is indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). We tested the efficacy of different strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1-BaL, HIV1-JRFL, and HIV1-631) to induce IDO in cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). A significant increase in both IDO protein and kynurenine synthesis was observed after 48 h in MDM infected with the brain-derived HIV-1 isolates, laboratory-adapted (LA) HIV1-JRFL, and primary isolate HIV1-631. In contrast, almost no kynurenine production or IDO protein was evident in MDM infected with the highly replicating macrophage-tropic LA strain HIV1-BaL. The induction of IDO and kynurenine synthesis by HIV1-JRFL and HIV1-631 declined to baseline levels by day 8 postinfection. Abundant HIV-1 replication did not reduce the ability of exogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) to induce IDO and kynurenine synthesis in HIV-infected MDM. The addition of anti-IFN-gamma antibody to MDM infected with HIV1-JRFL resulted in an absence of detectable IDO protein after 48 h and a decrease of 64% +/- 1% in supernatant kynurenine concentration. Together, these results indicate that only selected strains of HIV-1 are capable of inducing IDO synthesis and subsequent kynurenine metabolism in MDM. The induction of IDO, while apparently independent of replication capacity, appears to be mediated by a transient production of IFN-gamma in MDM responding to the initial infection with selected strains of HIV-1."

The mechanisms by which nef contributes to pathogenesis in vivo remain unclear. We investigated the contribution of nef to HIV-1 replication in human lymphoid tissue ex vivo by studying infection with parental HIV-1 strain NL4-3 and with a nef mutant (DeltanefNL4-3). In human tonsillar histocultures, NL4-3 replicated to higher levels than DeltanefNL4-3 did. Increased virus production with NL4-3 infection was associated with increased numbers of productively infected cells and greater loss of CD4(+) T cells over time. While the numbers of productively infected T cells were increased in the presence of nef, the levels of viral expression and production per infected T cell were similar whether the nef gene was present or not. Exogenous interleukin-2 (IL-2) increased HIV-1 production in NL4-3-infected tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, DeltanefNL4-3 production was enhanced only marginally by IL-2. Thus, Nef can facilitate HIV-1 replication in human lymphoid tissue ex vivo by increasing the numbers of productively infected cells and by increasing the responsiveness to IL-2 stimulation."

Interferon alfa and ribavirin therapy lead to sustained clearance of virus in 31% to 64% of patients with type 1 and non-type 1 genotypes, respectively. It is not clear to what extent these drugs act directly to reduce HCV replication, or indirectly via host immune responses, and what evoked immune responses are associated with clinical outcome. We have examined prospectively 15 patients with chronic HCV infection before, during, and after combination therapy. Quantitative assays for HCV antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and flow cytometric assays for analysis of the phenotype of T cells, in addition to viral sequencing of core protein, were performed throughout the treatment and follow-up period over 18 months. We found enhancement of proliferative T-cell responses during therapy. Proliferative responses are strikingly heterogeneous in terms of specificity, kinetics, and magnitude. Proliferative responses are often not associated with interferon-gamma release. T-cell responses are rarely sustained irrespective of treatment outcome and this is not due to the evolution of new immune escape variants. T-cell responses tend to peak late in the course of treatment. In conclusion, combination therapy for HCV has a transient effect on host virus-specific T cells in the blood. Induction of sustained T-cell responses may require additional immune modulation later in therapy."

Sera and PBMCs were collected from 90 HB patients. Gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) analysis was used to determine the distribution and expansion of populations expressing specific TCRBV complementary determined region 3 (CDR3) genes. TCRBV genes associated with monoclonal expansion were sequenced. TCRBV families from the majority of patients (80/90) displayed skewed T-cell expansion. Furthermore, TCRBV11, BV12 and BV13.1 were more frequent than other TCRBV genes; the sequence of TCRBV11 CDR3 was expressed as 'VYNEQ' in all patients and was accompanied by the BJ2.1 fragment. In patients with chronic HB, the frequency of skewed TCRBV was inversely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. The persistently skewed TCRBV gene families in HB patients may be associated with the development and maintenance of hepatitis. GMSP analysis of TCRBV gene families may be helpful in estimating disease status, and BV11 may be associated with HBV replication in patients with chronic HBV infection."

HIV-1 is a predominant subtype of HIV which counts on human cellular mechanism virtually in every aspect of its life cycle. Binding of viral envelope glycoprotein-gp120 with human cell surface CD4 receptor triggers the early infection stage of HIV-1. This study focuses on the interaction interface between these two proteins that play a crucial role for viral infectivity. The CD4-gp120 interaction interface has been studied through a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis and highlighted as a useful step towards identifying potential therapeutic drug targets against HIV-1 infection. We prioritized gp41, Nef and Tat proteins of HIV-1 as valuable drug targets at early stage of viral infection. Lack of crystal structure has made it difficult to understand the biological implication of these proteins during disease progression. Here, computational protein modeling techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to generate three-dimensional models of these targets. Besides, molecular docking was initiated to determine the desirability of these target proteins for already available HIV-1 specific drugs which indicates the usefulness of these protein structures to identify an effective drug combination therapy against AIDS."

The early and near-total loss of these cells from the rectal mucosa severely compromises the ability of the mucosal immune system to control various opportunistic infections. Protecting these cells from infection and destruction can delay disease progression, leading to a better long-term outcome. Here we show that effective suppression of viral infection in memory CD4 T cells from the rectal mucosa and peripheral blood to a very low level with antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated prior to the peak of infection is associated with opposite outcomes in these tissues. A near-total loss of CD4 T cells in the rectal mucosa contrasted with preservation of most memory CD4 T cells in peripheral blood during the course of treatment. Interestingly, ART significantly reduced viral infection in memory CD4 T cells from both rectal mucosa and peripheral blood. Although early ART was of limited value in protecting the CD4 T cells in the rectal mucosa, the significant preservation of peripheral CD4 T cells could contribute to maintaining immune competence, leading to a better long-term outcome."

We used ex vivo HIV-1 infection of sorted blood mononuclear cells to model the in vivo infection of blood leukocytes. Using quantitative real-time PCR to detect full-length HIV-1 DNA, both sorted CD11c(+) myeloid and CD11c(-) plasmacytoid DCs were more frequently infected than other blood mononuclear cells, including CD16(+) or CD14(+) monocytes or resting CD4(+) T cells. There was a strong correlation between CCR5 coreceptor use and preferential DC infection across a range of HIV-1 isolates. After infection of unsorted blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 was initially detected in the CD11c(+) DCs and later in other leukocytes, including clustering DCs and activated T cells. DC infection with R5 virus was productive, as shown by efficient transmission to CD4(+) T cells in coculture. Blood DCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and cultured alone expressed only low levels of multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA unless cocultured with CD4(+) T cells. Early selective infection of immature blood DCs by R5 virus and upregulation of viral expression during DC-T-cell interaction and transmission provide a potential pathway for R5 selection following parenteral transmission."

The present study aimed at characterizing genotypic subtypes of viral isolates from 70 HTLV-I-infected individuals from São Paulo, Brazil, including 42 asymptomatic carriers and 28 patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), using restricted fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of long terminal repeat (LTR) HTLV-I proviral DNA sequences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates were amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplicons submitted to enzymatic digestion using a panel of endonucleases. Among HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers, viral cosmopolitan subtypes A, B, C and E were identified in 73.8%, 7.1%, 7.1% and 12% of tested samples, respectively, whereas among HAM/TSP patients, cosmopolitan A (89.3%), cosmopolitan C (7.1%) and cosmopolitan E (3.6%) subtypes were detected. HTLV-I subtypes were not statistically significant associated with patients' clinical status. We also conclude that RFLP analysis is a suitable tool for descriptive studies on the molecular epidemiology of HTLV-I infections in our environment."

However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."

Six (66.7%) of them were positive for anti-HD, a prevalence much higher than that in HBsAg carriers without hemophilia in Japan (1/113 or 0.9%, p less than 0.001). Anti-HIV was found in 96 (47.5%), in sharp contrast to the low prevalence (0/1205) in apparently healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001).

Activation of JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling is essential for the induction of cellular antiviral responses, contributes to apoptosis and is negatively regulated by SOCS proteins. Recent reports have shown that SOCS3 activation interferes with viral protein expression and treatment response and thereby plays a major role in hepatitis virus infections. We analyzed the expression of SOCS3 in liver specimens from HBV-infected patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determined the effect of HBV on STAT/SOCS signaling in functional cell culture experiments (HuH-7) using HBV-expressing adenoviral constructs (AdHBV). Increased expression of SOCS3 protein was identified in liver specimens from patients with chronic HBV-infection and this correlated with the severity of liver inflammation. In accordance with the IHC-findings, in vitro analyses demonstrated that HBV infection of HuH7 cells was associated with increased expression of SOCS3 protein. In spite of the over expression of its negative regulator SOCS3 we observed a constitutive activation of STAT3. SOCS1 levels were not increased while pSTAT1 was suppressed in HBV-infected HuH7 cells. Our results demonstrate that STAT/SOCS-signaling is dysregulated in HBV-infected hepatocytes both in vivo and in vitro and this correlated with the severity of liver inflammatory changes. This interference of STAT/SOCS signaling by HBV may result in an ineffective immune response against HBV and potentially contributes to viral pathogenesis, malignant transformation and may represent an important mechanism of viral persistence."

HIV-1 utilizes a number of viral proteins and subsequent cytokine inductions to unleash its toxicity on neurons. Among HIV-1 viral proteins, Nef is a small protein expressed abundantly in astrocytes of HIV-1-infected brains and has been suggested to have a role in the pathogenesis of HAND. In order to explore its effect in the central nervous system, HIV-1 Nef was expressed in primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFAs) using an adenovirus. Our results revealed that HIV-1 Nef is released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from PHFA cells expressing the protein. Interestingly, HIV-1 Nef release in EVs was enriched significantly when the cells were treated with autophagy activators perifosine, tomaxifen, MG-132, and autophagy inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin suggesting a novel role of autophagy signaling in HIV-1 Nef release from astrocytes. Next, Nef-carrying EVs were purified from astrocyte cultures and neurotoxic effects on neurons were analyzed. We observed that HIV-1 Nef-containing EVs were readily taken up by neurons as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. Furthermore, treatment of neurons with Nef-carrying EVs induced oxidative stress as evidenced by a decrease in glutathione levels. To further investigate its neurotoxic effects, we expressed HIV-1 Nef in primary neurons by adenoviral transduction. Intracellular expression of HIV-1 Nef caused axonal and neurite degeneration of neurons. Furthermore, expression of HIV-1 Nef decreased the levels of phospho-tau while enhancing total tau in primary neurons. In addition, treatment of primary neurons with Nef-carrying EVs suppressed functional neuronal action potential assessed by multielectrode array studies. Collectively, these data suggested that HIV-1 Nef can be a formidable contributor to neurotoxicity along with other factors, which leads to HAND in HIV-1-infected AIDS patients."

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects 25% of HIV+ individuals, with greater rates ( approximately 75%) in intravenous drug users and persons infected through contaminated blood or blood products. HIV-hepatitis co-infected individuals show an accelerated course of liver disease, with faster progression to cirrhosis. The number of anti-HBV drugs has increased in the last few years, and some agents (e.g. lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir) also exert significant activity against HIV. Emergence of drug resistance challenges the long-term benefit of anti-HBV monotherapy, mainly with lamivudine. The results using new more potent anti-HBV drugs (e.g. tenofovir) are very promising, with prospects for stopping or even revert HBV-related liver damage in most cases. With respect to chronic hepatitis C, the combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin given for 1 year permits to achieve sustained HCV clearance in no more than 40% of HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Thus, new direct anti-HCV drugs are eagerly awaited for this population. Although being a minority, HIV+ patients with delta hepatitis and those with multiple hepatitis show the worst prognosis. Appropriate diagnosis and monitoring of chronic viral hepatitis, including the use of non-invasive tools for assessing liver fibrosis and measurement of viral load, may allow to confront adequately chronic viral hepatitis in HIV+ patients, preventing the development of end-stage liver disease, for which the only option available is liver transplantation.

One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pararetrovirus that replicates its genomic DNA via reverse transcription of a viral pregenomic (pg) RNA precursor. Here, we demonstrate that the two isoforms of human ZAP (hZAP-L and -S) inhibit HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cells through posttranscriptional down-regulation of viral pgRNA. Mechanistically, the zinc finger motif-containing N-terminus of hZAP is responsible for the reduction of HBV RNA, and the integrity of the four zinc finger motifs is essential for ZAP to bind to HBV RNA and fulfill its antiviral function. The ZRE sequences conferring the susceptibility of viral RNA to ZAP-mediated RNA decay were mapped to the terminal redundant region (nt 1820-1918) of HBV pgRNA. In agreement with its role as a host restriction factor and as an innate immune mediator for HBV infection, ZAP was upregulated in cultured primary human hepatocytes and hepatocyte-derived cells upon IFN-α treatment or IPS-1 activation, and in the livers of hepatitis B patients during immune active phase. Knock down of ZAP expression increased the level of HBV RNA and partially attenuated the antiviral effect elicited by IPS-1 in cell cultures. In summary, we demonstrated that ZAP is an intrinsic host antiviral factor with activity against HBV through down-regulation of viral RNA, and that ZAP plays a role in the innate control of HBV replication. Our findings thus shed light on virus-host interaction, viral pathogenesis, and antiviral approaches. "

We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage.

Two decades of research have shown that HIV-related immunosuppression is correlated with increased malaria infection, burden, and treatment failure, and with complicated malaria, irrespective of immune status. The recent role out of antiretroviral therapies and new antimalarials, such as artemisinin combination therapies, raise additional concerns regarding possible synergistic and antagonistic effects on efficacy and toxicity. Co-trimoxazole, which is used to prevent opportunistic infections, has been shown to have strong antimalarial prophylactic properties, despite its long-term use and increasing antifolate resistance. The administration of efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, with amodiaquine-artesunate has been associated with increased toxicity. Recent in vivo observations have confirmed that protease inhibitors have strong antimalarial properties. Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and artemether-lumefantrine have a synergistic effect in terms of improved malaria treatment outcomes, with no apparent increase in the risk of toxicity. Overall, for the prevention and treatment of malaria in HIV-infected populations, the current standard of care is similar to that in non-HIV-infected populations. The available data show that the wider use of insecticide-treated bed-nets, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy might substantially reduce the morbidity of malaria in HIV-infected patients. These observations show that those accessing care for HIV infection are now, paradoxically, well protected from malaria. These findings therefore highlight the need for confirmatory diagnosis of malaria in HIV-infected individuals receiving these interventions, and the provision of different artemisinin-based combination therapies to treat malaria only when the diagnosis is confirmed."

Macrophages and T-cells are the natural target cells of HIV-1 infection. A consensus has not been reached as to whether HIV replication results in differential recombination between primary T-cells and macrophages. Here, we used HIV with silent mutation markers along with next generation sequencing to compare the mutation and the recombination rates of HIV directly in T lymphocytes and macrophages. We observed a more than four-fold higher recombination rate of HIV in macrophages compared to T-cells (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this difference is not due to different reliance on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptors between T-cells and macrophages. We also found that the pattern of recombination across the HIV genome (hot and cold spots) remains constant between T-cells and macrophages despite a three-fold increase in the overall recombination rate. This indicates that the difference in rates is a general feature of HIV DNA synthesis during macrophage infection. In contrast to HIV recombination, we found that T-cells have a 30% higher mutation rate than macrophages (p < 0.001) and that the mutational profile is similar between these cell types. Unexpectedly, we found no association between mutation and recombination in macrophages, in contrast to T-cells. Our data highlights some of the fundamental difference of HIV recombination and mutation amongst these two major target cells of infection. Understanding these differences will provide invaluable insights toward HIV evolution and how the virus evades immune surveillance and anti-retroviral therapeutics. "

Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, aminotransferases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), ferritin and viral markers of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) and anti-HIV were assayed for all cases by a third-generation ELISA method. HCV PCR was performed for 75 cases. Of the 174 patients, none of them were HBsAg and anti-HIV positive. However, 90 patients were anti-HCV positive (51.7%). HCV PCR was positive in 56 patients (74.3%) of the 75 with positive antibody tested. HCV antibody positivity is statistically significant with age of the patient, serum ferritin and liver transaminases (P < 0.01). HCV-RNA by PCR positivity was significantly related to patients' age and serum ferritin (P < 0.05). Serum ferritin showed statistically significant positive correlation with liver transaminases. Despite the decrease in prevalence of HCV antibody in our patients from 71% in 1995 to 51.7% in our study, yet HCV infection still represents a major health problem for our thalassemic patients, which requires more attention and efforts to challenge. There is a dramatic decrease in the prevalence of HBV infection over the last decade, thanks to mass compulsory vaccination and blood screening. HIV infection does not represent a problem owing to very low population prevalence."

After the release of highly active antiretroviral therapy, liver disease has become the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. Prior to 2011, HCV treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin in HCV/HIV co-infected patients only allowed 14-38% of patients with HCV genotype 1 to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR). Additionally, treatment was commonly discontinued as a result of adverse events. Recently, simeprevir and sofosbuvir have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for HCV mono-infection. Sofosbuvir has been given FDA approval in co-infected patients offering unprecedented SVR rates and the potential for interferon-free therapy. HCV therapies that are in the pipeline offer improved treatment times, safety profiles, and rates of SVR. Despite these improvements, several new issues including adherence, drug-drug interactions with antiretroviral therapies, adverse events, resistance, and patient selection may complicate therapy. This article reviews the current status of direct-acting antivirals (DAA)-containing regimens for HIV/HCV co-infected patients in the USA. New results investigating telaprevir and boceprevir are also discussed as they are relevant for locations where new DAAs are not available. The impact future interferon-free therapies may have on co-infected patients is also discussed."

The goals of this paper are to guide the establishment and development of pharmacy services for patients infected with HCV and to highlight HCV research and educational opportunities. Recommendations were based on the following: a review of published data on clinical pharmacist involvement in the treatment and management of HCV-infected patients; a consensus of clinical pharmacists who provide direct patient care to HCV-infected patients and practice in different pharmacy models, including community-based and academic settings; and a review of published guidelines and literature focusing on the treatment and management of HCV infections. The recommendations provided in this opinion paper define the areas of clinical pharmacist involvement and clinical pharmacy practice in the treatment and management of patients with HCV. Clinical pharmacists can promote preventive measures and education about reducing HCV transmission, improve medication adherence, assist in monitoring clinical and adverse effects, recommend treatment strategies to minimize adverse effects and drug interactions, and facilitate medication acquisition and logistics that positively improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care system costs.

Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."

One sample each year from the date of HCV infection to 1994 was analysed for genotype, virus load and nucleotide sequence of the two genetic loci. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 throughout the study period. The virus load profiles were similar except that the profile for the HIV infected patient was displaced 4 years earlier relative to the other patient. Mean divergence of the quasispecies at both the 5'UTR and NS4 loci was higher in the HIV coinfected patient. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the 5'UTR was host independent, whereas the NS4 region containing a CD8 restricted CTL epitope evolved in a host specific fashion."

The aim of this study was to assess the role of medical procedures in transmission of hepatitis C in north-eastern Poland. In total, 194 patients with chronic hepatitis C were eligible for the study. The control group consisted of 275 age- and sex-matched individuals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use were excluded. On multivariate analysis, transfusions [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.3], minor surgery (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7) and dental care (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were independently associated with HCV infection.

3845,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."

Specimens should be transported to the laboratory in plastic bags labeled with an easily recognized biohazard warning. Placing patients in private rooms is unnecessary unless a patient has an additional illness that requires such an arrangement.

Asymptomatic hospital personnel with HIV antibody can safely engage in direct patient care. Routine HIV serologic screening of personnel or patients is not recommended. Counseling and HIV antibody testing should be offered to pregnant high-risk women. Laboratories that process specimens potentially containing HIV virus should adhere to maximum containment procedures.

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group.

We evaluated the seroprevalence of these viruses in selected individuals from a clinic of infectology, who were referred to the University Regional Hospital of the West Region of state of São Paulo, Brazil. Among a total of 7,021 individuals seen in the clinic following receipt of preliminary ELISA results or having the suggested clinical signs of viral hepatitis or HIV, 1,228 were systematically screened. Isolated or associated HBsAg, HCV and HIV antibodies were found in 44.9% of the subjects. Anti-HIV antibodies were found in 24.7% of the patients, 20.3% of whom had an HIV monoinfection and 4.4% of whom were co-infected with hepatitis viruses (HCV: 4%; HBV: 0.4%).

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV in blood donors at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul and to evaluate the effect of changes in the national blood transfusion policies on the prevalence of these infections. The screening results of 72695 blood donations at the Red Crescent Center in Istanbul between January and December 2007 were evaluated retrospectively. HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were screened by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) method. Samples found to be positive for anti-HIV 1/2 and anti-HCV were confirmed by Inno-Lia HCV Ab III and Inno-Lia HIV I/II Score, respectively. The seropositivity rates for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HIV-1/2 were determined as 1.76%, 0.07%, and 0.008%, respectively. Compared to the previously published data from Red Crescent Centers in Turkey, it was found that HBV and HCV seroprevalances decreased and HIV seroprevalance increased in recent years. In conclusion, we believe that the drop in HBV and HCV prevalence rates are likely multifactorial and may have resulted from more diligent donor questioning upon screening, a higher level of public awareness on viral hepatitis as well as the expansion of HBV vaccination coverage in Turkey. Another factor to contribute to the decreased prevalence of HCV stems from the use of more sensitive confirmation testing on all reactive results, thereby eliminating a fair amount of false positive cases. Despite similar transmission routes, the increase in HIV prevalence in contrast to HBV and HCV may be linked to the increase in AIDS cases in Turkey in recent years."

This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

To investigate the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/2) and other blood-borne or sexually transmitted agents we tested a total of 256 serum samples collected in the summer of 1995 from blood donors, hospitalized children and adults in Mogadishu. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) carrier rate was 191%, 5.6% and 21.3 % among blood donors, hospitalized children and hospitalized adults, respectively. However, no children under 2 years of age were HbsAg positive. The overall presence of antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) was 2.4% (6/256). In blood donors this was 0.6% (1/157). In none of the samples tested, antibodies against HIV 1 and 2 or human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV I and II) were detected. Our results indicate that, during the civil war in Somalia, no evidence of an increase of HIV infections was found. Our findings indicate that preventive measures in Somalia should focus mainly on prevention of HBV-infections. HBV-vaccine could be administered within the framework of the expanded programme on immunization, as none of the children less than 2 years of age were HbsAg positive."

Clinical guidelines aim at streamlining medical attitudes: in this respect, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recently issued clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic hepatitis B. Guidelines made by international experts need however to be adapted to local health care systems. Here, we summarise the EASL guidelines with some minor modifications in order to be compatible with the particular Swiss situation, while discussing in more detail some aspects. Chronic hepatitis B is a complex disease with several phases where host and viral factors interact: the features of this continuous interplay need to be evaluated when choosing the most appropriate treatment. The EASL guidelines recommend, as first-line agents, using the most potent antivirals available with the optimal resistance profile, in order to abate HBV DNA as rapidly and as sustainably as possible. Once therapy has been started, the infection evolves and resistant viral strains may emerge. Rescue therapy needs to be started early with more potent agents lacking cross-resistance."

Health care workers face occupational hazards for HCV infection primarily through needlestick and other contaminated sharps accidents, although the risks are much lower than those historically documented for HBV. Current universal bloodborne precautions for infection control appear to be effective against occupational cross-infection in patient care settings. Ongoing studies in patients with long-term persistent hepatitis C are investigating the usefulness of prolonged interferon therapy to reduce hepatic damage and HCV chronicity."

Recently, however, there has been quite dramatic improvement in the understanding of HBV associated liver disease and its treatment. It has become clear that high viral replication is a major risk factor for the development of both cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early studies have shown lamivudine lowers the risk of HBV associated complications. There are currently three nucleos(t)ides licensed, in addition to interferon, and there are more drugs coming to the market soon. Interferon or its pegylated counterpart are still the only options for treatment with defined end points, while nucleos(t)ides therapy is used mostly for long term treatment. Combination therapies have not been shown to be superior to monotherapy in naive patients, however, the outcome depends on how the end point is defined. Interferon plus lamivudine achieves a higher viral suppression than either treatment alone, even though Hbe-seroconversion was not different after a one year treatment. HBV-genotypes emerge as relevant factors, with genotypes ""A"" and ""B"" responding relatively well to interferon, achieving up to 20% HBsAg clearance in the case of genotype ""A"". In addition to having a defined treatment duration, interferon has the advantage of lacking resistance selection, which is a major drawback for lamivudine and the other nucleos(t)ides. The emergence of resistance against adefovir and entecavir is somewhat slower in naive compared to lamivudine resistant patients. Adefovir has a low resistance profile with 3%, 9%, 18%, and 28% after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively, while entecavir has rarely produced resistance in naive patients for up to 3 years."

Clinical observations have suggested that HBV genotype is associated with the response to IFN therapy; however, its role in viral responsiveness to IFN in HBV-infected hepatocytes remains unclear. Here, we produced infectious virions of HBV genotypes A to D to infect three well-recognized cell-culture-based HBV infection systems, including primary human hepatocytes (PHH), differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG), and HepG2-NTCP cells to quantitatively compare the antiviral effect of IFN-α on HBV across genotypes and cell models. The efficacy of IFN-α against HBV in hepatocytes was generally similar across genotypes A2, B5, C2, and D3; however, it was significantly different among the infection models given that the half maximal inhibitory concentration value of IFN-α for inhibition of viral DNA replication in PHH (<20 U/mL) and dHepaRG cells were much lower than that in HepG2-NTCP cells (>500 U/mL). Notably, even in PHH, IFN-α did not reduce HBV covalently closed circular DNA at the concentrations for which viral antigens and DNA replication intermediates were strongly reduced. The three cell-culture models exhibited differential cellular response to IFN-α. The genes reported to be associated with responsiveness to IFN-α in patients were robustly induced in PHH while weakly induced in HepG2-NTCP cells upon IFN-α treatment. Reduction or promotion of IFN response in PHH or HepG2-NTCP cells significantly attenuated or improved the inhibitory capacity of IFN-α on HBV replication, respectively."

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

We report here systematic design and characterization of 28 novel TALENs targeting multiple regions of CCR5 gene (CCR5-TALEN) which encodes the co-receptor critical for entry of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). By systemic characterization of these CCR5-TALENs, we have identified one (CCR5-TALEN-515) with higher nuclease activity, specificity, and lower cytotoxicity compared with zinc-finger nuclease (CCR5-ZFN) currently undergoing clinical trials. Sequence analysis of target cell line GHOST-CCR5-CXCR4 and human primary CD4 T cells showed that the double-strand breaks at the TALEN targeted sites resulted in truncated or nonfunctional CCR5 proteins thereby conferring protection against HIV-1 infection in vitro. None of the CCR5-TALENs had detectable levels of off-target nuclease activity against the homologous region in CCR2 although substantial level was identified for CCR5-ZFN in the primary CD4 T cells. Our results suggest that the CCR5-TALENs identified here are highly functional nucleases that produce protective genetic alterations to human CCR5. Application of these TALENs directly to the primary CD4 T cells and CD34 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of infected individuals could help to create an immune system resistant to HIV-1 infection, recapitulating the success of ""Berlin patient"" and serving as an essential first step towards a ""functional"" cure of AIDS."

However, the rate of spontaneous mutation of human HBV in vivo is currently unknown. Here, based on the evolutionary principle that the population frequency of lethal mutations equals the rate at which they are produced, we have estimated the mutation rate of HBV in vivo by scoring premature stop codons in 621 publicly available, full-length, molecular clone sequences derived from patients. This yielded an estimate of 8.7 × 10-5 spontaneous mutations per nucleotide per cell infection in untreated patients, which should be taken as an upper limit estimate because PCR errors and/or lack of effective lethality may inflate observed mutation frequencies. We found that, in patients undergoing lamivudine/adefovir treatment, the HBV mutation rate was elevated by more than sixfold, revealing a mutagenic effect of this treatment. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that lamivudine/adefovir treatment increases the fraction of A/T-to-G/C base substitutions, consistent with recent work showing similar effects of lamivudine in cellular DNA. Based on these data, the rate at which HBV produces new genetic variants in treated patients is similar to or even higher than in RNA viruses. "

Here, we identify an individual whose good initial control of viremia was lost in association with reduced containment of a superinfecting strain. Subject 2030 presented with acute symptoms of HIV-1 infection with high viremia and an incomplete seroconversion as shown by Western blotting. A low set point of viremia (approximately 1,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) was initially established without drug therapy, but a new higher set point (approximately 40,000 HIV-1 copies/ml) manifested about 5 months after infection. Drug susceptibility testing demonstrated a multidrug-resistant virus initially but a fully sensitive virus after 5 months, and an analysis of pol genotypes showed that these were two phylogenetically distinct strains of virus (strains A and B). Replication capacity assays suggested that the outgrowth of strain B was not due to higher fitness conferred by pol, and env sequences indicated that the two strains had the same R5 coreceptor phenotype. Delineation of CD8+-T-lymphocyte responses against HIV-1 showed a striking pattern of decay of the initial cellular immune responses after superinfection, followed by some adaptation of targeting to new epitopes. An examination of targeted sequences suggested that differences in the recognized epitopes contributed to the poor immune containment of strain B. In conclusion, the rapid overgrowth of a superinfecting strain of HIV-1 of the same subtype raises major concerns for effective vaccine development."

However, the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine is frequently suboptimal in this population. High CD4+ cell counts and low HIV viraemia are well known factors associated with a better rate of response. Moreover, higher hepatitis B vaccine doses and/or prolongation of the vaccination schedule, as implemented for patients with immune deficiencies other than HIV, may be considered. New vaccination cycles should be considered if post-vaccination titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are < 10 mIU/mL (< 10 UI/L).

HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1, and infection with HIV-2 leads to significantly lower plasma viral load. To identify the source of this difference, we measured both viral RNA and proviral DNA in matched samples from 34 HIV-2-infected individuals. Nearly half had undetectable viral RNA loads (<100 copies/ml), but levels of proviral DNA were relatively high and confirmed that quantities of provirus in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection were similar. Overall, HIV-2 proviral DNA load did not correlate with viral RNA load, and higher viral RNA load was associated with increased production of plasma virus from the proviral template. These results suggest that low viral load in HIV-2 infection is due to decreased rates of viral production, rather than differences in target cell infectivity."
314,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"We have studied the extent of genetic and phenotypic diversification of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) upon 15 serial passages of clonal viral populations in MT-4 cell cultures. Several genetic and phenotypic modifications previously noted during evolution of HIV-1 in infected humans were also observed upon passages of the virus in cell culture. Notably, the transition from non-syncytium-inducing to syncytium-inducing phenotype (previously observed during disease progression) and fixation of amino acid substitutions at the main antigenic loop V3 of gp120 were observed in the course of replication of the virus in MT-4 cell cultures in the absence of immune selection. Interestingly, most genetic and phenotypic alterations occurred upon passage of the virus at a low multiplicity of infection (0.001 infectious particles per cell) rather than at a higher multiplicity of infection (0.1 infectious particles per cell). The degree of genetic diversification attained by HIV-1, estimated by the RNase A mismatch cleavage method and by nucleotide sequencing, is of about 0.03% of genomic sites mutated after 15 serial passages. This value is not significantly different from previous estimates for foot-and-mouth disease virus when subjected to a similar process and analysis. We conclude that several genetic and phenotypic modifications of HIV-1 previously observed in vivo occur also in the constant environment provided by a cell culture system. Dilute passage promotes in a highly significant way the expression of deviant HIV-1 genomes."

Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."

The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."
8537,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"It is estimated that, in the United States and Europe, 15-30% of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Among these patients, approximately 80% are intravenous drug users (IVDU), 71% are hemophiliacs, and around 20% are homosexual/bi-sexual men. HIV infection accelerates the natural history of HCV infection. On the contrary, highly active antiretroviral therapy reduces the rate of mortality due to liver disease by immune restoration. Since having HIV implies being at risk also for HCV as both infections can be acquired in similar ways, all individuals with the former should be screened for the latter. Loss of antibodies against HCV in HIV-seropositive IVDU has been shown. Thus, quantitative tests determining HCV-RNA levels in blood are currently being employed for diagnosis confirmation in case of an obvious ''risk group''. Since HIV can progress more rapidly than HCV, it may be preferable to treat HIV first. The 2007 recommendations from HCV-HIV International Panel indicate current treatment of HCV in coinfected patients with pegylated formulation of interferon at standard doses plus weight based ribavirin. The treatment duration should be evaluated on the basis of HCV genotype. Liver transplantation is a most debated issue when dealing with HCV/HIV coinfected subjects. Mortality among HIV-infected liver transplant recipients is similar to that of age and race-matched HIV-negative controls.

As a comparison group, HIV-infected patients from Europe were tested. African and European patients showed an almost identical antibody reactivity profile in terms of epitope specificity and involvement of IgG, IgG subclass, IgA and IgM responses. A V3-peptide of gp120 was identified as major epitope recognized by IgG1>IgG2 = IgG4>IgG3, IgA>IgM antibodies and a C-terminal peptide represented another major peptide epitope for the four IgG subclasses. By contrast, gp41-derived-peptides were mainly recognized by IgG1 but not by the other IgG subclasses, IgA or IgM. Among the non-surface proteins, protease, reverse transcriptase+RNAseH, integrase, as well as the capsid and matrix proteins were the most frequently and strongly recognized antigens which showed broad IgG subclass and IgA reactivity. Specificities and magnitudes of antibody responses in African patients were stable during disease and antiretroviral treatment, and persisted despite severe T cell loss. Using a comprehensive panel of gp120, gp41 peptides and recombinant non-surface proteins of HIV-1 clade C we found an almost identical antibody recognition profile in African and European patients regarding epitopes and involved IgG-sublass, IgA- and IgM-responses. Immune recognition of gp120 peptides and non-surface proteins involved all four IgG subclasses and was indicative of a mixed Th1/Th2 immune response. The HIV-1 clade C proteome-based test allowed diagnosis and monitoring of antibody responses in the course of HIV-infections and assessment of isotype and subclass responses. "

Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically naïve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."
4844,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "

However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account.

HBV can be classified into six genotypic families: A, B, C, D, E and F, but only genotypes A and D are significantly represented in western Europe, where they account for some 90% of cases of infection with HBV. In the present study, we investigated a possible association between HBV genotype A or D and clinical outcome of the infection. We compared the prevalence of these genotypes in a group of patients with chronic active hepatitis to that of a group with acute resolving hepatitis. In patients with chronic active hepatitis, genotype A was found in 28 of 35 patients and genotype D in only four. The remaining three patients were infected with genotype non-A, non-D. In contrast, genotype D was found in 24 of 30 patients with acute hepatitis, whilst genotype A was found in only three patients of this group. Three were infected with genotype non-A, non-D. Our results show a clear association between genotype A and chronic outcome (Ficher's exact test: two-sided P-value, P < 0.0001). They suggest that HBV genotypes may play a role in the virus-host relationship. Possible mechanisms for such a role are discussed."

Overall, spontaneous viral clearance rate is 10-25% and the only approach that can halt disease progression is hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by means of antiviral therapy. In non-haemophilic patients a single nucleotide polymorphism located upstream the gene of interferon lambda 3 (IFNλ3) has been associated with both spontaneous viral clearance and sustained virological response after antiviral treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether the rs12979860 polymorphism was a predictor of spontaneous viral clearance and of sustained virological response after antiviral therapy in a large cohort of haemophilic patients with HCV infection. The rs12979860 polymorphism, defined as CC genotype or T allele, was tested in a cohort of 342 haemophilic patients and evaluated as predictor of spontaneous clearance or response to antiviral therapy. By multivariate regression analysis the IFNλ3 CC genotype was an independent predictor of spontaneous viral clearance (odds ratio: 3.7, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.8). Sustained virological response rates were doubled in patients with the CC genotype than in those with the T allele (78% vs 44%; p<0.001), especially in patients with HCV type 1 (67% vs 32%; p<0.001) and higher sustained response rates were observed in patients with the CC genotype who did not achieve rapid virological response (61% vs 30% in T allele patients; p=0.006).

One possible reason for this phenotype is alteration in large (L-HBsAg) to small (S-HBsAg) envelope protein ratio associated with reduced or non secretion of HBsAg. This results in quantitative levels of serum HBsAg below the detection limit of enzyme immunoassays. Genotype D of HBV has a characteristic 33 nucleotide (nt) deletion upstream of the pre-S2/S promoter. This deletion may reduce HBsAg secretion in occult infection patients infected with genotype D HBV. Additional deletions in the pre-S2/S promoter may further aggravate reduced HBsAg secretion in patients infected with genotype D HBV. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of genotype D specific 33nt deletion and additional pre-S2/S promoter deletions in causing reduced or no secretion of HBsAg, in occult infection. Since these deletions overlap virus polymerase, their effect on virus replication was also investigated."

However, the role of IL28B in subtype 3a infection remains unclear, and has not yet been assessed in the UK population where subtype 3a is dominant. In this study, we evaluated the role of the IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8099917 in 201 patients recruited from two well-defined cohorts (from Nottingham and Oxford), treated with the standard-of-care therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24 weeks. We showed that the 'favourable' IL28B gene was associated with a rapid virological response to therapy at 4 weeks (P<0.0001), but not with a sustained virological response to therapy. The median viral load at baseline, before therapy, was markedly increased in people with the 'favourable' IL28B genotype [median viral load for the TT allele, 925,961 IU ml(-1) (range 2200-21,116,965 IU ml(-1)), and for the GT or GG allele, 260,284 IU ml(-1) (range 740-7,560,000 IU ml(-1)); P = 0.0010]. Our results suggest that the host genetic response plays an important role in early viral clearance of subtype 3a virus from the blood. However, significant reservoirs of infection must persist, as viral relapse is common, even in those with the favourable host genotype."

In this study we aimed to analyze HIV-1 gp41 transmembrane protein (TM) variability and primary resistance to T-20 in plasma viruses from 10 HIV-1 subtype B infected homosexuals. Nine out of ten were documented seroconverters. Nine individuals (including one long time infected therapy naïve individual) were part of four linked virus infection chains. We also examined TM polymorphism in two AIDS patients under HAART and T-20 therapy. Obtained TM amplicons were examined for minor variants by clonal analysis.Sequences polymorphism of the N-terminal regions of the fusion domain (FD) and the heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domain were demonstrated in examined seroconverters. Analysis of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain revealed T-20 resistance in cloned sequences from 3/10 individuals. In two individuals these mutations were present as minor viral quasispecies. Transmission of the resistant virus to the sexual partner was traced in virus infection chain.Baseline TM amplicons (population sequence) and clones from two patients under HAART did not contain T-20 resistance associated mutations. After onset of T-20 therapy only resistant viruses were identified in plasma from the patients. As shown by clonal analysis of plasma from one patient, treatment interruption results in viruses reverting to a T-20-sensitive genotype."

Strategies for managing HCV, however, require an assessment of the effectiveness of intervention in routine clinical practice. We report the outcomes of combination therapy in a large cohort of HCV-infected individuals in the UK. A total of 347 (113 genotype 1, 234 genotype non-1) patients were treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin according to current guidelines. Forty-two (37.2%) of those with genotype 1 infection and 164 (70.1%) with genotype non-1 infection achieved sustained viral response (SVR). Thirty-nine (11%) patients withdrew from treatment. In addition to viral genotype, factors predictive of a response to therapy were age at start of treatment and disease stage on pretreatment liver biopsy. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age [odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval (0.31-0.82) per 10-year increment (P = 0.006)] were confined to genotype 1 disease. In order to further inform the management of the individual patient, a multivariate logistic model was used to predict the probability of SVR for subgroups defined by disease stage, genotype and age at commencement of therapy. This model revealed striking differences in predicted response rates between subgroups and provided a strong rationale for early treatment, particularly for those with genotype 1 disease. Our study demonstrates that results comparable with those of RCTs can be achieved in clinical practice, and suggests that prediction of response rates based on probability modelling will provide a valuable adjunct to individual patient management."

Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies performed prior to this showed transient in vivo decreases of HIV-1 plasma viremia in all three subjects. Surrogate markers of HIV activity, clinical status, HIV-1 p24 antigen, plasma HIV-1 titers, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) intracellular titers of virus were measured at entry, and every other week after onset of therapy. All subjects demonstrated rsCD4 concentration-dependent reduction in plasma viremia, with two subjects having complete neutralization of cell-free virus. The third subject's isolate was relatively resistant to the in vivo effects of rsCD4 and only partial reduction in plasma virus titers was obtained, even at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg. There was no change in the PBMC intracellular viral titer or surrogate markers of HIV-1 activity (including CD4 cell count and beta 2-microglobulin). There was subjective improvement in clinical symptoms, and all subjects gained weight with the highest doses of rsCD4. rsCD4 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied. We conclude that high-dose intravenous rsCD4 can be safely given for up to 10 weeks and that it has a stable pharmacokinetic profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."

Nevertheless, HB vaccine hesitancy may result in low vaccination coverage in present-day at-risk adults. We aimed to determine HB vaccination coverage in adults attending a free testing center for sexually transmitted infections (STI). As part of routine care, three classes of data were anonymously collected from attendees over a 3-month period: results of HB serologic tests; date and number of past anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) immunization(s) (if any) according to health records; and the risk of STI and blood-transmitted infections (BTI). The study included 735 participants (age 27.9 ± 9.2; 59.9% men). According to available health records (341 participants), 56.6% had received at least three and 67.2% at least one vaccine injection(s); 57.7% had received their last injection between 1994 and 1998, reflecting the strong vaccine policy during these years. Serologic testing (in 705 participants) showed evidence of a past or active HBV infection for 33 participants; of the remaining patients, 55.3% had anti-HBs antibody titers ≥10 IU/L. This rate was not higher in participants considered at risk for STI/BTI. Of the participants who received their last vaccine injection more than 15 years previously, 90.5% had anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥10 and 60.3% ≥100 IU/mL.

Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."

Tumor histology was mixed germ cell tumor in 4 patients, pure seminoma in 1 and Burkitt's lymphoma in 1. Patients underwent routine staging evaluations. Three patients had low stage mixed germ cell tumor (clinical stage 1 or 2A) and underwent retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy, which revealed pathological stage 1 or 2A disease in 1 and 2, respectively. These patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients had advanced mixed germ cell tumor (clinical stage 2C) or Burkitt's lymphoma (clinical stage 4) and received combination chemotherapy from the onset. Outcome was evaluated with regard to progression of HIV disease and tumor status. The 2 patients who were only HIV positive remained so for 9 and 48 months. The 3 patients with AIDS-related complex had progression to AIDS within 1 to 9 months and 2 of these patients died 1 1/2 and 7 months after tumor diagnosis. All 3 patients with resected low stage disease had tumor recurrence within 1 to 9 months and were begun on platinum-based combination chemotherapy. The risk of false low clinical staging and early tumor progression may be higher in HIV positive men than in other testis tumor patients. Patient ability to tolerate chemotherapy and to obtain a satisfactory tumor response appeared to be primarily related to lack of progression of HIV disease to frank AIDS."

In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."

We studied the prevalence and risk factors of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among systematically followed HIV-infected women enrolled from a population with low HIV prevalence. The study population consisted of 108 HIV-infected women enrolled between 1989 and 2003 with a mean follow-up 4.4 years. Risk factors of SIL were assessed based on samples collected during 2000-02. The overall rates of atypical glandular cells of uncertain significance (AGUS), atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS), low-grade SIL (LSIL) and high-grade SIL (HSIL) were 4, 24, 15 and 5%, respectively. Reduced CD4-lymphocyte count was associated with an increased prevalence of SIL, whereas duration of HIV infection (< or > or =5 years), use of antiretroviral medication, or HIV viral load (<50 or > or =50 copies/mL) was not. The cumulative risk of developing SIL after 1 and 5 years was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7-27%) and 48% (95% CI 33-63%), respectively. The cumulative risk of SIL was increased among women younger than 31 years (P = 0.04) as well as in women displaying high initial HIV viral load (P = 0.01). Our results from a low HIV-incidence population re-emphasize the importance of guidelines for cytologic screening of HIV-seropositive women."

Despite the importance of the human A3 protein family for the innate immune response little is known about the clinical relevance for hepatitis B. The aim of this study was to utilize ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) data to analyse the phenomenon of G-to-A hypermutation of the complete HBV genome and to relate it to fundamental characteristics of patients with chronic hepatitis B. By analysing the viral population of 80 treatment naïve patients (47 HBeAg-positive and 33 HBeAg-negative), we identified an unequal distribution of G-to-A hypermutations across the genome. Our data indicate that G-to-A hypermutation occurs predominantly in a region between nucleotide positions 600 and 1800 a region which is usually single stranded in matured HBV particles. This implies that A3 likely edits HBV in the virion. Hypermutation rates for HBeAg-negative patients were more than 10-fold higher than those of HBeAg-positive patients. For HBeAg-negative patients higher hypermutation rates were significantly associated with the degree of fibrosis. Additionally, we found that for HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis G-to-A hypermutation rates were significantly associated with the relative prevalence of the G1764A mutation, which is related to HBeAg seroconversion. In total, our data imply an important association of hypermutation mediated by A3 deaminases with the natural progression of chronic hepatitis B infections both in terms of HBeAg seroconversion and disease progression towards cirrhosis.

A retrospective cohort study of representative samples of AIDS patients treated with a NVP-based regimen was performed. A total of 206 adult HIV/AIDS cases with median age (IQR) 33 years (range, 29-38 years), 51% male, treated between January 2004-December 2005, were included. Most (92.2%) of the patients were naïve to antiretroviral drug. The incidence of NVP toxicity was 1.09/100 person-months. The median onset time was 4 weeks post NVP initiation (2.57 weeks for skin toxicity and 12.43 weeks for hepatic toxicity). History of drug allergy and NVP toxicity were significantly associated (p = 0.006), as were sulfamethoxazole allergy and toxicity (p = 0.015). Regarding concomitant medication, concurrent anti-tuberculosis drugs significantly increased the risk of NVP associated liver toxicity (p = 0.001). Therefore, it is important to monitor adverse events from NVP, including liver function tests among HIV/AIDS patients with history of drug allergy, especially against sulfamethoxazole, and those concurrently treated with antituberculosis drugs."

However, most have focused on naïve patients and do not assess the impact of HAART on viral load (VL). Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adherence program in a cohort of multitreated and poorly adherent patients. We performed a cohort study of all adult HIV-1 infected patients with detectable VL who were treatment experienced and poorly adherent to HAART, included in an adherence program since its introduction in 2009 (n=136). The adherence program consisted of a multidisciplinary team with a nurse who specialized in behavioral intervention, counselling on substance abuse, and motivational interviewing, as well as a social worker responsible for referring patients to local healthcare centers. Effectiveness was evaluated as percentage of patients with VL <50 copies/mL at week 48 by modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis. Initially, 76.6% of the patients had an adherence <30% according to the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ). At 48 weeks, 48.1% of the patients had VL <50 copies/mL, and the adherence was >90% in 71% of the patients. In multivariate analysis, a ratio of bottle refill per month >0.9 during the study [odds ratio (OR) 14.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.08-50.08, p<0.001] and being on a b.i.d. regimen (OR 12.5; 95% CI 1.81-86.4, p=0.010) were associated with an undetectable VL. In conclusion, the adherence program was successful in almost half of the patients, despite their long treatment experience and prior poor adherence. This strategy may help to prevent disease progression and the risk of HIV transmission in these patients."

While cross-sectional studies suggest that cocaine users may be at increased risk for depression, long-term effects of cocaine on depressive symptoms remain unclear. This is a longitudinal study of 341 HIV-infected and uninfected men (135 cocaine users and 206 controls) ages 30-60 enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during 1996-2009. The median baseline age was 41; 73% were African-American. In mixed-effects models over a median of 4.8 years of observation, cocaine use was associated with higher depressive symptoms independent of age, education level, and smoking (n = 288; p = 0.02); HIV infection modified this association (p = 0.03). Latent class mixed models were used to empirically identify distinct depressive trajectories (n = 160). In adjusted models, cocaine use was associated with threefold increased odds of membership in the class with persistent high depressive symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-6.69) and eightfold increased odds (95% CI (2.73-25.83) when tested among HIV-infected subjects only. Cocaine use is a risk factor for chronic depressive symptoms, particularly among HIV-infected men, highlighting the importance of integrating mental health and substance use treatments to address barriers to well-being and successful HIV-care."

By an enzyme immunoassay, 9 of the 699 recipients were repeatedly positive. Serial serum samples of these 9 patients were then confirmed with a Western blot analysis and with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for HTLV-I genome. Four were already positive for anti-HTLV before transfusion, 1 carried antibodies to HTLV-I transiently after transfusion, and only 4 cases had de nova seroconversions. These patients and their family members were called back and tested for HTLV-I genome in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma. All the serologically positive patients, except the ""transient one,"" were positive for HTLV sequences in the PBMCs. Viral sequences could also be detected in several serum or plasma samples. In the family members, only the spouse of a pretransfusion-positive patient was infected. These results suggested that approximately 0.6% of the blood recipients were infected by HTLV-I through transfusion in Taiwan, and that the frequency of intrafamilial HTLV-I transmission is low. We also observed the unusual coinfection by both HTLV-I and hepatitis C virus in 2 patients, and superinfection of hepatitis C virus after blood transfusion in 1 HTLV-I carrier. Cases of coinfection suggest a prevalence of both viruses in blood donors and warrant further screening."

The availability of these small animal models for the study of HIV-related syndromes including KS, epidermal proliferative lesions, HIV-associated nephropathy, AIDS-related growth failure and cachexia may well facilitate the development of novel therapies for these complications. Other phenotypes created in mice, such as cataracts and hepatic cancer [59], may not have human analogies but may still provide insight into pathogenesis. Thus, transgenic models have already provided resources to study many manifestations of AIDS and others are likely to be developed. The optimal strategy for designing future transgenic animals, however, is less clear. No transgenic mouse model has been generated to date that will provide an avenue for vaccine development. This advance awaits the further discovery of the host factors that facilitate the virus replicative cycle in humans and a better understanding of these pathways in the mouse. For the development of molecular-based therapy, however, the currently available models may well be adequate to test molecular inhibitors of transcription [7,60,61] and post-transcriptional processing of viral mRNA [62]. Whether single or multigenic constructs under the control of the LTR are better or worse for this purpose is a debatable issue. Transgenic technology may yet make an additional contribution to the development of molecular therapy for AIDS. The best method of demonstrating that a gene therapeutic strategy is safe to administer to patients has not been determined. By introducing potentially therapeutic constructs into mice as transgenes, their safety can be assessed in many different cell types in vivo, analogous to toxicological testing in rodents for systemically administered drugs. Thus, transgenic technology has already provided insights into the pathogenesis of HIV-1. While it has not yet proven its utility for vaccine development, transgenic technology holds the promise of being an active participant in the development of both safe and effective gene therapy approaches for the treatment of AIDS."

The prevalence of GBV-C/HGV RNA, determined by reverse transcription-PCR for a portion of the NS3 region of the viral genome, was 2.7% (4 of 150) among randomly collected blood donor sera, which were all negative for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen and antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV). On the other hand, the prevalence among anti-HCV-positive blood donors was 17.8% (13 of 73), with the ratio being significantly higher than that observed with the anti-HCV-negative blood donors (P < 0.001). A high prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection was also observed among patients with chronic liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis (5.7%), liver cirrhosis (11. 5%), and hepatocellular carcinoma (7.0%), and patients on maintenance hemodialysis (29.0%). No correlation was observed between GBV-C/HGV viremia and serum alanine aminotransferase levels in the populations tested, suggesting the possibility that GBV-C/HGV does not cause apparent liver injury. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of a portion of the 5' untranslated region and the E1 region of the viral genome identified, in addition to a previously reported then novel group of GBV-C/HGV variants (group 4), another novel group of variants (group 5). This result suggests that GBV-C/HGV can be classified into at least five genetic groups. GBV-C/HGV isolates of group 4 and group 5 were each shown to comprise approximately 40% of the total Indonesian isolates."

Subtypes adw and ayw represented 21 of the 22 sequenced isolates. The sequence of the X gene of HBV strains from these patients differed from the ones of Far East origin by A to T(1678) and G to A(1759) changes for subtype ayw and C to T(1792) for adw. The expression of the preC region, as indicated by the detection of HBe antigen (HBeAg), was not observed in 11 patients. In 6 patients (3 HCC and 3 non HCC), the absence of HBeAg could be related to a stop codon at position 28. For the 5 remaining patients, the precore stop mutation at codon 28 was not evidenced but 3 out these 5 patients had mutations at nt 1764 and nt 1766 in the promoter of the preC/C gene. These two mutations were also observed in 2 patients with HBeAg, indicating that they are not implicated in the suppression of expression of this gene. Independently of the serotype, two main differences were noted between aminoacid (aa) sequences of chronic hepatitis and HCC related strains: first, twice as many aa changes were found in HCC patients than in chronic hepatitis B carriers (mean of aa changes per patient 4.1 vs. 2.0) and second, we found apparition of polar aa in HCC patients. Most mutations already described in patients from the Far East with HCC have been found in strains of patients from Lorraine. The changes K130M and V131I, considered as ""hot spot mutations,"" were found in strains of HCC patients carrying an ayw subtype of the HBV genome but not in the ones of chronically infected patients. In contrast, strains of the adw subtype had these two changes in the two groups of patients.

We describe 4 patients with CRF on hemodialysis who showed a rapid and full response to 3TC, administered for a median of 10 months. All patients had serum alanine transferase (ALT) levels 3 to 6 times the upper limit of normal prior to treatment, and different degrees of histologic inflammatory activity (Knodell score 4 to 8, median 6). All were serum HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive, with serum HBV DNA 1-3.9 x 107 copies/mL (median 1 x 107 copies/mL). Within 4 to 8 weeks of initiation of therapy, HBV DNA became undetectable and serum ALT normalized. Serum HBeAg disappeared in all 4 patients, with the emergence of anti-HBeAb in 3 of them. Three patients also lost HBsAg with the evolution of a protective anti-HBsAb titer. One patient has already undergone successful kidney transplantation with no evidence of HBV recurrence (serum HBV DNA negative) 16 months postoperatively. Although our study sample is small, these data suggest that 3TC can induce a complete biochemical, virological and serological response in patients with CRF and HBV infection.

Among 34 asymptomatic carriers who had hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA in the serum, HBV DNA was detected in 29 (85%) PBMC. In remarkable contrast, of the remaining 42 carriers seronegative for HBeAg, only 1 (2%) had HBV DNA in the serum, and none exhibited HBV DNA in PBMC. Among 32 patients seropositive for HBeAg, HBV DNA was detected in 28 (88%) sera, and in 24 (75%) PBMC. Of 68 patients seronegative for HBeAg, HBV DNA was found in 10 (15%) sera, and in 7 (10%) PBMC. Among 62 cases with HBV DNA in PBMC, only 1 had it integrated into the host's DNA. The remaining 61 had free HBV DNA in PBMC. Only 8 of them possessed replicative intermediate forms of HBV DNA, with molecular sizes less than 2.0 kilobases as observed in liver infected with HBV, and they all were patients with chronic active hepatitis. HBV DNA was not detectable in PBMC from 172 controls comprising 44 healthy individuals and 128 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis. Based on these results, the state of HBV DNA in PBMC reflects the phase of HBV infection with HBeAg in the serum, and a high activity of hepatitis accompanied by active HBV replication."

Baseline genotypic resistance testing was performed for HIV-1-infected treatment-naive patients who were newly diagnosed between 2003 and 2007 and attended the government HIV clinic in Hong Kong. International AIDS Society-USA mutation figures and the Stanford resistance interpretation algorithm were used to identify resistance mutations and drug susceptibility, respectively. The pattern and factors associated with resistance were examined. The presence of one or more IAS-USA resistance mutations was found in 26 (3.6%) of 731 patients over the 5-year study period. Overall, protease inhibitor (PI) resistance mutations were most common (16), followed by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) (8) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (3). Resistance to drugs in one, two, and three classes was present in 25 (3.4%), 1 (0.1%), and 0, respectively. Seventy-eight (10.7%) had strains of reduced susceptibility, as predicted by the Stanford algorithm to display at least low-level resistance to one or more drugs of the three classes. Intermediate or high-level resistance was found in 1.6% overall, and in descending order for NRTIs, PIs, and NNRTIs. There was no temporal trend of increase in resistance. Sex between men, Chinese ethnicity, and lower baseline CD4 were associated with harboring resistant strains as elucidated by either method. We conclude that transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance is uncommon in up to two decades of antiretroviral therapy in Hong Kong. The situation has to be continually monitored for any change in significance."

The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."

The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."

This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."

Using purified nef recombinant protein and six synthetic nef peptides, antibodies to the product of an HIV-1 regulatory gene, the negative regulatory factor (nef) involved in maintenance of proviral latency, were detected by Western blot and radioimmunoassay techniques in HIV-1-seronegative, viral antigen-negative, and virus culture-negative individuals at risk for HIV infection. This antibody response to nef was correlated in eight individuals with the detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA by oligonucleotide hybridization, following enzymatic amplification of HIV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such latent HIV infections have now been followed for up to 6 or 10 months in five individuals. In addition, retrospective and prospective analysis of HIV-1-seropositive individuals have shown (1) antibodies to nef preceding seroconversion, and (2) the persistence of antibodies to nef and of HIV-1 proviral DNA in a case of spontaneous complete HIV-1 seronegativation. Since DNA amplification cannot be currently considered for routine use, screening for anti-nef antibodies followed by confirmation by DNA amplification could represent a basis for new diagnostic strategies. Beyond their diagnostic implications, these findings, suggesting that regulatory genes of the HIV-1 provirus can be expressed prior to the initiation of virion synthesis, may also be applicable in the design of alternative vaccines against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

Histologically, the testes contained peritubular fibrosis and variable spermatogenic arrest, which were inconsistent with the young age of these patients. There were also numerous foci of germ cell degeneration and occasional germ cell loss. The Leydig cells were atrophic and decreased in number. The prostates contained increased numbers of concretions. Sections of testis and prostate were stained with an anti-HIV P17 monoclonal antibody with the use of the avidin-biotin technique. Small scattered foci of positive staining were identified in 8 of 14 testes (57%). They were located over one or several degenerating germ cells and the surrounding Sertoli cells. In addition, in 9 of 14 prostates (64%) there were a few minute foci of positive staining in several adjacent glandular epithelial cells. In one case the testis was positive and the prostate was negative, whereas in two cases the testes were negative and the prostate positive. In contrast, 22 testes and 22 prostates of control non-AIDS patients, read double-blind, were negative. The positive controls were HIV-infected tissue culture HUT 78 lymphoma cells in which there were many scattered positive cells. The results indicate the presence of focal HIV-associated protein in the testes and prostates of patients with AIDS, particularly within the foci of germ cell degeneration. The present observations are in accordance with previous research demonstrating the presence of HIV in the seminal fluid of patients with AIDS and appears to indicate the presence of an infection of the male genital tract by the HIV virus."

Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."

Adherence was measured by self-reported number of ART pills/capsules missed during the previous week and previous month, evaluated as satisfactory when less than 5%. 101 HIV+ adults took part in this study, 60.4% males, ranging from 20 to 71 years of age (mean = 37.9 years), and 73.3% symptomatic. Data procedures included interviews and the use of validated instruments. The majority of participants (n = 73; 72.3%) reported adherence of > 95%. Logistic regression showed that a history of self-reported ART interruption and self-efficacy expectations were significant adherence predictors. Upgrading of care with interdisciplinary teams is needed to develop an appropriate approach to the medical and psychosocial difficulties of ART adherence by persons with HIV/AIDS."

Previously, we demonstrated ethanol-mediated alterations to metabolism of elvitegravir (EVG) in human liver microsomes. In the current study, we investigated ethanol influence on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of EVG in HIV infected monocytic (U1) cells. U1 cells were treated with 5 μM EVG, 2 μM Cobicistat (COBI), a booster drug, and 20 mM ethanol for up to 24 hours. EVG, HIV p24 levels, alterations in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, MRP1, and MDR1 protein expressions were measured. Presence of ethanol demonstrated a significant effect on the total exposures of both EVG and EVG in combination with COBI. Ethanol also increased the HIV replication despite the presence of drugs and this elevated HIV replication was reduced in the presence of MRP1 and MDR1 inhibitors. Consequently, a slight increase in EVG concentration was observed in the presence of MRP1 inhibitor but not with MDR1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CYP3A4, MRP1 and MDR1 protein levels were significantly induced in treatment groups which included ethanol compared to those with no treatment. In summary, these findings suggest that Ethanol reduces intra cellular EVG exposure by modifying drug metabolism and transporter protein expression. This study provides valuable evidence for further investigation of ethanol effects on the intracellular concentration of EVG in ex vivo or in vivo studies."

We investigated whether severe immunodeficiency in co-infection is associated with changes in intrahepatic inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels. We measured interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 mRNA levels by real-time PCR performed on liver samples from HCV mono-infected (n = 19) and HCV/HIV co-infected (n = 24) patients. Co-infected patients had decreased intrahepatic mRNA levels of IFN-gamma (P = 0.09), IL-4 (P = 0.05) and IL-12p35 (P = 0.04) compared with mono-infected patients, while IL-10 was increased (P = 0.07). In co-infected patients, IFN-gamma mRNA levels increased linearly with increasing peripheral CD4+ cell counts by 1.23 times relative to the calibrator for every 100 CD4+ cells/mm(3) increase (P = 0.02). No other cytokines were significantly associated with CD4+ cell counts. In conclusion, HIV-induced lymphopenia may result in hepatic inflammatory cytokine suppression in HCV/HIV co-infection. Intrahepatic IFN-gamma levels are significantly reduced in patients with advanced immunodeficiency. Further studies are needed to assess whether decreased IFN-gamma secretion by HCV-specific CD4+ cells may account for accelerated fibrogenesis in these patients."

New IMx assays for HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc detection were also used. The population studied was composed of 65 chronic hepatitis cases (40 positive for hepatitis B antigen [HBeAg] and 25 positive for anti-HBe) and 23 anti-HBe-positive, asymptomatic HBsAg carriers. Serum HBsAg levels detected by IMx were higher in HBeAg-positive than in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers (all patient subgroups included) and correlated with the serum HBV DNA level (P = 0.0001). Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ags were detected by enzyme immunoassays in almost all HBsAg carriers. Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ag titers correlated positively with the serum HBsAg concentration (P = 0.0001), but only the pre-S1 Ag titer correlated with the level of serum HBV DNA (P = 0.02). The detection of low levels of IgM anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibodies by IMx was associated with the presence of liver disease (P = 0.05) but not with the level of viral replication. The prevalence of anti-HBx antibodies detected by the enzyme immunoassay was slightly, although not significantly, higher in patients with high levels of HBV DNA (greater than 100 pg/ml) than in patients without detectable HBV DNA (P = 0.16). In anti-HBe-positive chronic HBsAg carriers, the quantitative detection of serum HBV DNA, pre-S Ag titers, and IgM anti HBc allowed us to predict which patients suffered from chronic liver disease and/or supported viral replication (P < 0.05). In a follow-up study of eight patients undergoing antiviral therapy, the clearance of both pre-S1 Ag and HBV DNA was associated with a subsequent clearance of HBV. Therefore, the quantitative determination of HBV DNA, pre-S Ags, IgM anti-HBc may prove useful for the decision to use and the monitoring of antiviral therapy, especially in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers."

In this study, we investigated clinical and immunohistological features of HBV-associated glomerulonephritis in 14 children aged from 2.5 to 16 years (mean 10 years). The nephrotic syndrome was present in 9 (64%) and the nephritic syndrome in 8 children (57%). Five children had both nephrotic and nephritic syndrome together (35%). Renal insufficiency was determined in 4 of 14 patients (28%). Surface antigen (HBsAg) was present in all, with no history of clinically apparent hepatitis. Investigation of all renal tissue samples with light and immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed the diagnosis of membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) in 6, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in 7, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in 1 child. Renal tissue samples were studied by the immunoperoxidase method for HBsAg in all cases; only in 4 children was HBsAg detected in the glomeruli. Examination of liver tissue samples was available in 4 cases, revealing chronic hepatitis in all, with additional development of cirrhosis in 1 and the presence of HBsAg in hepatocytes in all. Of the patients, 8 received corticosteroid treatment; 1 of them achieved a complete remission, while 4 had a partial remission with persistent proteinuria and hematuria. Four patients who received no treatment had a spontaneous remission within 5 months to 10 years following the onset of the renal disease. Two patients died of renal failure, while 1 died of intercurrent sepsis. The patient with IgAN received interferon-alpha 2a and lamuvidine, which resulted in a remission and a marked decrease in HBV DNA titer. The remaining 2 were lost to follow-up. Although MGN has been reported as the nephropathy most commonly associated with HBsAg antigenemia in adults, our study revealed that MPGN could occur in children as well as MGN, without any clinical or historical evidence of hepatitis. The present study provides further evidence for a causal relationship between HBV hepatitis and HBs antigenemia-related glomerulonephritides in the pediatric age group. It also indicates the prognosis (71%) of the associated nephropathies with or without treatment is quite favorable in childhood."

Most of the patients were injecting drug users (71%) and male (88%). All patients were studied for CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, resistance mutations, and viral phenotype. The patients showed a high accumulation of resistance-associated mutations, their CD4(+) cell count and viral load directly correlated with their respective values at initiation of therapy, and the presence of K103N was inversely associated with lower viral load. On the other hand, patients with K103N had the same level of CD4(+) cell count compared with patients without this mutation. Among the patients, a majority with a specific viral phenotype was not present. Rather, a dual-tropic virus was found most frequently, suggesting a preferential suppression of X4-specific strains and less cytopathogenicity during antiretroviral therapy and a greater proportion of R5X4 viruses due to an adaptation to that pressure."

The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

In this scenario, a precise knowledge of the situation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV chronic co-infection is required to adequately address this disease. This cross-sectional study was performed in 21 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients with an active HCV chronic infection who were not receiving HCV treatment at the time of inclusion. A total of 13,506 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Of them, 2561 (18.9 %) presented chronic HCV infection. The majority of the patients included were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 96.2 %), showed plasma levels with an undetectable HIV viral load (92.5 %), and had a good immunological status (median CD4+ cell count of 486 cells/mL). The HCV genotype distribution was as follows: 58.1 % were genotype 1, 1.1 % were genotype 2, 16.1 % were genotype 3, and 22.1 % were genotype 4 (2.6 % were missing data).

With regards to previous HCV treatment experiences, 68.05 % of the patients were naïve and 31.95 % had failed to respond to a previous treatment. The burden of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in our population was reported as one in five HIV-infected patients requiring HCV treatment.

Nevertheless, it is still useful to administer specific prophylactic treatment against opportunistic infections in patients treated with HAART and also in patients who do not respond to HAART or who cannot or do not wish to take that treatment. Prophylactic treatment can be halted when, due to HAART, there is a sustained increase in the CD4+ T-lymphocytes count (that count indicates the degree of susceptibility that a person has to opportunistic infections). Guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections were developed in 1995 by the United States Public Health Service and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and they have been reviewed periodically. The last review, done in 1999, marked the introduction of important changes regarding clinical parameters to halt primary and secondary prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium avium complex.

1820,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."

Through ongoing attention to prevention, risky sexual and needle-sharing behaviors among persons with HIV infection can be reduced and transmission of HIV infection prevented. Medical care providers can substantially affect HIV transmission by screening their HIV-infected patients for risk behaviors; communicating prevention messages; discussing sexual and drug-use behavior; positively reinforcing changes to safer behavior; referring patients for services such as substance abuse treatment; facilitating partner notification, counseling, and testing; and identifying and treating other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). To help incorporate HIV prevention into the medical care of HIV-infected persons, CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America developed these recommendations. The recommendations are general and apply to incorporating HIV prevention into the medical care of all HIV-infected adolescents and adults, regardless of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. They are intended for all persons who provide medical care to HIV-infected persons (e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants); they might also be useful to those who deliver prevention messages (e.g., case managers, social workers, health educators). The recommendations were developed by using an evidence-based approach. For each recommendation, the strength of the recommendation, the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation, and the outcome for which the recommendation is rated are provided. The recommendations are categorized into three major components: screening for HIV transmission risk behaviors and STDs, providing brief behavioral risk-reduction interventions in the office setting and referring selected patients for additional prevention interventions and other related services, and facilitating notification and counseling of sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons."

The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."

These results demonstrate that patients may have more HIV-1 provirus copies in an advanced than early stage of disease, and that the fraction of the infected lymphocytes is much higher than previously thought, especially in asymptomatic patients. There was no difference in the viral burden in CD4+ T lymphocytes regardless of whether AZT had been administered or not.

Infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and a pseudotyped luciferase-expressing chimeric virus using MAGI and GHOST/CXCR4 cells showed that in 1 hr of viral adsorption the extent of virus infection and the amount of tightly adsorbed viruses depended on temperature; and that membrane fluidity increased according to increased temperature. Augmented infection was observed as post-attachment enhancement (PAE) when cells were washed and incubated at 40 C for 1 hr after viral adsorption. PAE was completely inhibited by 1 micro M of anti-CXCR4 peptide T140, and addition of T140 at 20 min resulted in a gradual loss of inhibition of PAE, indicating the need for a 30 to 40 min timelag to ensure tight multiple-site binding. These data suggest that the accumulation of gp120 and receptor complex (multiple-site binding) was needed to complete the infection. Treatments of cells with 0.05% Tween 20 or 2 micro g/ml of anti-HLA-II antibody resulted in increases or decreases, respectively, of attached viruses and the infectivity. As well, Tween 20 and anti-HLAII antibody enhanced and suppressed the fluidity of the plasma membrane, respectively. Amounts of adsorbed viruses and degrees of viral infectivity correlated with the intensity of fluidity of the plasma membrane, probably due to the formation of multiple-site binding."

This study measured cell-mediated immune responses using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 27 patients with chronic HIV-1 infection, the majority of whom were off antiretroviral therapy. The ELISPOT assay was used to detect gamma interferon-secreting PBMC after stimulation with overlapping HIV-1 peptides spanning the Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef proteins in addition to the baculovirus-derived p24 and gp160 proteins. All volunteers had responses to at least one HIV-1-specific peptide. All but one of the subjects (96%) responded to the Gag peptide pool, and 86% responded to the Pol and/or Nef peptide pools. The magnitude and the breadth of T-cell responses directed to either the Gag or p24 peptide pools correlated inversely with viral load in plasma (r = -0.60, P < 0.001 and r = -0.52, P < 0.005, respectively) and directly with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.54, P < 0.01 and r = 0.39, P < 0.05, respectively) using the Spearman rank correlation test. Responses to the Pol and integrase peptide pools also correlated with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.45, P < 0.05 and r = 0.49, P < 0.01, respectively). No correlation with markers of disease progression was seen with specific T-cell responses directed toward the Env or Nef peptides. These data serve as strong evidence that major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of Gag peptides is an essential feature for any HIV-1 vaccine designed to elicit optimal CD8+ T-cell responses."

Using a comprehensive panel of serological assays, we have previously demonstrated a complex and lengthy maturation of virus-specific antibody responses elicited by attenuated strains of SIV that was closely associated with the development of protective immunity. In the present study, we expand these analyses to address several questions regarding the nature of the virus-specific antibody responses to pathogenic SIV, SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV), and HIV-1 infections. The results demonstrate for the first time a common theme of antibody maturation to SIV, SHIV, and HIV-1 infections that is characterized by ongoing changes in antibody titer, conformational dependence, and antibody avidity during the first 6 to 10 months following virus infection. We demonstrate that this gradual evolution of virus-specific antibody responses is independent of the levels of virus replication and the pathogenicity of the infection viral strain. While the serological assays used in these studies were useful in discriminating between protective and nonprotective antibody responses during evaluation of vaccine efficacy with attenuated SIV, these same assays do not distinguish the clinical outcome of infection in pathogenic SIV, SHIV, or HIV-1 infections. These results likely reflect differences in the immune mechanisms involved in mediating protection from virus challenge compared to those that control an established viral infection, and they suggest that additional characteristics of both humoral and cellular responses evolve during this early immune maturation."

Acute HIV-1 infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes/macrophages cells, and the A3.01 T-lymphocyte-derived cell line was studied; both classes of HIV-1 mRNAs increased exponentially (r2 > 0.98) at days 1 to 3 and 1 to 4 postinfection in HIV(IIIB)-infected A3.01 cells and PBMCs, respectively, whereas monocytes/macrophages infected with monocytotropic HIV(BaL) exhibited a linear (r2 = 0.81 to 0.94) accumulation of US and MS transcripts. Following induction of chronically infected ACH-2 cells, MS transcripts increased 2 h postinduction and peaked at 5 h (doubling time, 58 min), while at 24 h, US mRNAs increased 3,053-fold compared with basal time (doubling time, 137 min). To address the biopathological significance of HIV-1 expression pattern during infection progression, pilot cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were carried out with samples from untreated and treated HIV-1-infected patients. In almost all untreated (recently infected, long-term nonprogressor, and progressor) patients, MS transcript levels followed the general trend of systemic HIV-1 activity. In patients under treatment with powerful antiretroviral compounds, viral MS transcripts rapidly fell to undetectable levels, indicating that in vivo, levels of MS mRNAs in PBMCs are closely associated with the number of newly infected cells and suggesting a new role for the quantitative analysis of HIV-1 transcription in infected patients."

High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."

The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."

The recommendations stress the importance of early diagnosis of HIV infection for the health of both women and their infants and are based on advances made in HIV-related treatment and prevention. The most significant advance for this population has been the results from a placebo-controlled, clinical trial that indicated that administration of zidovudine to HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns reduced the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV by approximately two thirds (1). This document recommends routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing for all pregnant women and is intended to serve as guidance for health-care providers in educating women about the importance of knowing their HIV infection status. For uninfected women, such HIV counseling and testing programs can provide information that can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV; for women who have HIV infection, these programs can enable them to receive appropriate and timely medical interventions for their own health and for reducing the risk for perinatal (i.e., mother to infant) and other modes of HIV transmission. These programs also can facilitate appropriate follow-up care and services for HIV-infected women, their infants, and other family members."

A total of 1040 women entered the study. The HIV-1 status of the babies was known in 848 cases (81.5%). Transmission rates were highest in the period 1988-1991, then tended to decrease and in 1995 the rate was 9.7 per 100 children (this finding, however, was based on only six infected children and the trend was not statistically significant). Considering the overall series, the risk of vertical HIV transmission was higher in women with low CD4 count in pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) < 400 versus > or = 400 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9]. In comparison with vaginal delivery the risk of transmission was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) respectively for elective and emergency delivery. In comparison with women who delivered at term (> or = 37 gestation weeks) the OR of HIV infection of the babies for the whole series was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.6) in women who delivered preterm. Similar findings emerged when the analysis was conducted considering, separately, subjects observed in the period 1988-1991 and 1992-1995. The frequency of Caesarean section increased from 26.5% of deliveries in 1988-1991 to 36.2% in 1992-1995. Consequently, most temporal differences disappeared after standardization for mode of delivery, but the rate in 1995 was still lower than in 1988-1994."

The presence of GBV-C RNA was determined in serum samples of 106 patients infected with HIV by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction. GBV-C genotypes were determined by direct sequencing. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HIV viral load and CD4(+) count were also tested in all patients. The overall prevalence of GBV-C infection was 11.3% in HIV patients. There was no significant difference between patients with and without GBV-C infection regarding age, sex, route of transmission, viral load, ALT levels, HBV and HCV co-infection and treatment with antiretroviral drugs. 66.7% of patients with GBV-C had a CD4(+) count > or = 200 and 33.3% had a CD4(+) count < 200 cells/mm(3). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all GBV-C isolates were genotype 2, and classified as subtype 2a. GBV-C infection is relatively common in patients infected with HIV. The prevailing GBV-C genotype 2a in this study group concurred with reports from other parts of the Middle East."

Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients.

Infant oropharyngeal aspirates obtained at birth were examined for HIV-1 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and qualitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nine infants (41%) had detectable levels of HIV-1 RNA, 3 of which were quantifiable (mean, 3000 copies/mL). This mucosal exposure to HIV-1 during delivery did not lead to infection of any infant. Cesarian delivery did not reduce mucosal exposure to HIV-1. Mucosal exposure did not correlate with maternal CD4 cell count but did correlate with maternal plasma virus load and was reduced by antiretroviral therapy."

Methods defining the antigenic specificity of the antibody response, such as the western blot, have become standard confirmatory tests in this setting. CD4+ cell enumeration and the HIV-1 antigen capture assay are useful in predicting the course of HIV-1 infection and in monitoring antiretroviral therapies. Newer techniques of HIV-1 co-cultivation permit the characterization of viral isolates and the stratification of patients and facilitate monitoring of the effects of antiretroviral agents.

HIV is known to influence the natural history of HBV, hastening progression to end-stage liver disease and cirrhosis. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV, and associated immune reconstitution, may result in immune-mediated liver damage as HBV-infected hepatocytes are targeted. This can lead to liver enzyme elevations that may be misattributed to drug-related toxicity. Thus, it is important that HIV-infected patients be tested for HBV and that clinicians be aware of the possibility of atypical serologic markers of HBV in HIV-infected patients. In managing coinfected patients, control of HIV is the priority. In patients with controlled HIV who are candidates for HBV therapy, the goals are the same as in the HBV-monoinfected population: hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, liver enzyme normalization, and HBV DNA suppression. Treatment options include interferon-based regimens, lamivudine, adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir. All of these agents have been shown to be relatively effective in HBV-monoinfected patients. However, few randomized, controlled HBV treatment trials have been conducted in coinfected subjects, and thus additional studies are warranted."

HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication."

P-TEFb phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), facilitating the transition from nonprocessive to processive transcription elongation. Recently, the bromodomain protein Brd4 has been shown to interact with the low-molecular-weight, active P-TEFb complex and recruit P-TEFb to the HIV type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. However, the subsequent events through which Brd4 regulates CDK9 kinase activity and RNAP II-dependent transcription are not clearly understood. Here we provide evidence that Brd4 regulates P-TEFb kinase activity by inducing a negative pathway. Moreover, by analyzing stepwise initiation and elongation complexes, we demonstrate that P-TEFb activity is regulated in the transcription complex. Brd4 induces phosphorylation of CDK9 at threonine 29 (T29) in the HIV transcription initiation complex, inhibiting CDK9 kinase activity. P-TEFb inhibition is transient, as Brd4 is released from the transcription complex between positions +14 and +36. Removal of the phosphate group at T29 by an incoming phosphatase released P-TEFb activity, resulting in increased RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and transcription. Finally, we present chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showing that CDK9 with phosphorylated T29 is associated with the HIV promoter region in the integrated and transcriptionally silent HIV genome."

Seven patients were diagnosed with HCC. The patients were subgrouped into cirrhotic versus noncirrhotic liver cohorts. Among renal allograft recipients with HBV infection, patients with cirrhotic livers had a higher risk of HCC (P = .003) and mortality (P = .025) than those with a noncirrhotic liver. The outcome was poor among the cirrhotic liver group. Pretransplantation liver biopsy may be indicated for the recipient candidate with HBV infection.

Mechanisms of HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) transactivation were investigated in HeLa cells transiently transfected with an IE4 expression plasmid and a CAT reporter gene under the control of the HIV-1 LTR. These results demonstrated that IE4-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR in HeLa cells required transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Using the gel retardation assay, it was shown that transfection of the IE4 expression vector in HeLa cells was not associated with induction of NF-kappaB under the p50.p65 heterodimeric form and that no direct binding of IE4 to the kappaB sites could be detected. Both Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses suggested that the ability of IE4 to activate transcription through kappaB motives was not connected with its capacity to override the inhibitory activities of IkappaB-alpha or p105. Finally, in vitro protein-protein interactions involving IE4 and basal transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein and transcription factor IIB were carried out. A direct interaction between IE4 and TATA-binding protein or transcription factor IIB components of the basal complex of transcription was evidenced, as well as binding to the p50 and p65 NF-kappaB subunits. Mutagenesis analysis of IE4 indicated that the COOH-terminal cysteine-rich and arginine-rich regions (residues 82-182) were critical for transactivation, whereas the first 81 amino acids appeared dispensable. Moreover, the arginine-rich region is required for the in vitro binding activity, whereas the COOH-terminal end did not appear essential."

Detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, AKR1B10 mRNA expression showed significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent non-tumor tissues, with a low level in normal liver tissues. Similar results was confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. High AKR1B10 expression was negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein level and positively correlated with HBV-DNA level. Patients with high AKR1B10 expression had significantly higher disease-free survival than those with low expression within 2 years after liver resection. Multivariate analysis also confirmed high AKR1B10 expression to be a predictor of low risk of early HCC recurrence. In addition, high AKR1B10 expression was found to be a favorable factor of overall survival. These results suggest that AKR1B10 is involved in HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis, but its high expression could predict low risk of early tumor recurrence in patients with HBV-related HCC after liver resection."

The expression of CD244, PD-1, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3) was analyzed in virus-specific CD8+ T-cells derived from peripheral blood or liver using major histocompatibility complex class I pentamers targeting immunodominant epitopes of HBV, Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV), or influenza virus (Flu). In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific CD8+ T-cells expressed higher levels of CD244 both in the peripheral blood and liver in comparison to the acute phase of infection or following resolution. CD244 was expressed at similarly high levels in EBV infection, but was low on Flu-specific CD8+ T-cells. In chronic HBV infection, high-level CD244 expression coincided with an increased expression of PD-1. The inhibition of the CD244 signaling pathway by antibodies directed against either CD244 or its ligand CD48 resulted in an increased virus-specific proliferation and cytotoxicity as measured by the expression of CD107a, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α in CD8+ T-cells."

In the present study, Tregs and conventional T cells (Tconvs) were isolated by magnetic cell sorting of peripheral blood from CHB patients (n=57), individuals with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (n=15), and healthy controls (n=29). SATB1 expression was studied by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, and the correlation of SATB1 expression to the expression of liver inflammation serum markers and the HBV DNA load was assessed. CHB patients showed significantly reduced SATB1 expression in Tregs than healthy controls and individuals with resolved HBV infections. Moreover, SATB1 expression in Tregs was significantly lower than in Tconvs of patients with chronic HBV infection. Serum HBV DNA and liver inflammation markers were inversely correlated to the SATB1 mRNA level in Tregs. Antiviral treatment was accompanied by increased expression of the SATB1 gene in Tregs. Thus, Tregs from CHB patients have reduced levels of SATB1, which is resolved with antiviral therapy. Inhibition of SATB1 expression may impair the hepatic inflammatory response and contribute to HBV persistence."

Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."

Antiretroviral therapy-associated hepatic toxicity is of increasing concern in the management of patients with HIV/AIDS. Liver toxicity has been reported in some HIV-infected patients being treated with drugs from all of these classes of ARV drugs: protease inhibitors (PIs), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Although the majority of cases involve asymptomatic elevations of liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), severe, and, in a minority of cases, life threatening, liver disease has been reported in patients treated with ARV drugs. The exact causes of elevated plasma levels of AST and ALT are complex and, in many cases, obscure. The combination of viral hepatic disease, drugs that act adversely directly on the liver and drugs that act on other systems of the body which in turn, adversely affect the liver, can result in hepatic toxicity. Such toxicity may be inappropriately attributed solely to the direct effect of a drug. Knowledge of the possible causes of liver toxicity, and ways to avoid it, should reduce the risk of developing hepatotoxicity. The physician's task is to prevent the development of liver toxicity, e.g., by choosing appropriate therapeutic regimens and by careful management of the patient. This involves frequent monitoring of the patient, both clinically and by utilizing liver function tests on a regular basis. If signs and symptoms of liver disease do develop, prompt and expert management is essential. This review discusses the influence of a number of factors on hepatic toxicity including viral hepatitis, insulin resistance and the specific ARV drugs used in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS."

Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors.

The spectrum of MALT lesions in children with HIV infection had not been previously described. In this study, six cases that demonstrated the spectrum of MALT lesions in pediatric patients, aged 28 months to 23 years, who had HIV infection were described. Half the patients acquired the infection perinatally, and half acquired it by transfusion. Mucosal sites of involvement included the salivary gland (4 patients), bronchiolar mucosa (2 patients), and oropharyngeal mucosa (1 patient). One patient had lesions in lung and oropharynx sequentially; all others had involvement of solitary sites. The histologic diagnoses included myoepithelial sialadenitis (MESA), MESA with low-grade MALT lymphoma, typical low-grade MALT lymphoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), and atypical pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis complex. The two cases of high-grade DLCL were confined to mucosal sites (tonsil and parotid); in one of these patients, a previous biopsy specimen showed a MALT lesion with low-grade features. In two cases, quantitation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome by the polymerase chain reaction showed a very high copy number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells but a low copy number in the MALT lesion, which suggested that MALT lesions may not be directly associated with EBV infection. Two patients who had high-grade tumors (DLCL) were successfully treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The remaining patients, all of whom had low-grade MALT lesions, received either corticosteroids or alpha-interferon or no specific therapy; in all patients, the lesions followed an indolent clinical course. Clinicians and pathologists should be alert to the possibility that MALT lesions, including MALT lymphomas, may be present in children who have AIDS."

In this autopsy study, 17 cases of AIDS-related pulmonary aspergillosis were identified from the files of two institutions. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions, the entire spectrum of pulmonary aspergillosis was represented. Thirteen patients exhibited acute invasive aspergillosis, and seven patients had evidence of subacute or chronic invasive infection, four of whom also had areas of acute invasion. One patient had necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis as well as acute invasive infection, and one individual had saprophytic colonization of a cavity caused by previous Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) without evidence of invasive aspergillosis. The same conditions known to predispose immunocompromised individuals without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were also identified in these patients with AIDS and included neutropenia, steroid therapy, and underlying lung disease. Additional pulmonary conditions were identified in all but one case and consisted mainly of infection or some form of chronic lung disease. In particular, half of the cases were associated with pulmonary fibrosis related to prior PCP. All cases occurred in or after 1990, confirming the perception of the recent emergence of aspergillosis in AIDS. As suggested by this study, one reason for this may be that patients with AIDS are now living long enough to develop one or more of the predisposing conditions for pulmonary aspergillosis."

However, few studies have investigated the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD (Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp) and YVDD (Tyr-Val-Asp-Asp) populations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients whilst undergoing lamivudine (LMV) treatment. In this study, we sought to investigate the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD and YVDD variants by ultrasensitive real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (RT-ARMS-qPCR) and evaluate its significance for changes in the treatment of CHB patients. RT-ARMS-qPCR was established and evaluated with standard recombinant plasmids. Fifteen CHB patients receiving LMV (100 mg daily) were consecutively recruited and followed up for 60 weeks. Serum samples were obtained from each patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. The total HBV DNA, HBV YMDD DNA and YVDD DNA levels were measured using RT-ARMS-qPCR at all given time points after treatment. Routine liver biochemistry parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were also measured every 12 weeks. The linear range of the assay was between 1×10(12) and 1×10(5) copies ml(-1). The low detection limit was 1×10(4) copies ml(-1). After 60 weeks of LMV treatment, nine patients experienced virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant could be detected 12-48 weeks before virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant was detected as the predominant population (range 69.4-100 %) in patients by the time virological breakthrough appeared. We concluded that RT-ARMS-qPCR was sensitive for the detection and quantification of low levels of HBV mutation. Periodic detection of HBV YM(V)DD every 12 weeks during LMV treatment is helpful for therapeutic decision making. "

The aim of this prospective study was to detect HHV-8 prevalence in HIV-1-infected patients,in a Turkish population. A total of 85 anti-HIV-1 positive patients (53 male, 32 female; age range: 1-70 years) diagnosed at Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology Department were included in the study. In 45 (53%) of the patients HIV-RNA was detectable and viral loads were between 20-10.000.000 copies/ml. HHV-8-specific IgG antibodies were screened by using a commercial ELISA kit (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc, USA), and the presence of HHV-8 nucleic acids were investigated by PCR (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) in the blood samples obtained from patients. HHV-8 IgG was detected in 28.2% (24/85) of the anti-HIV-1 positive patients, and HHV-8 DNA was detected in 3.5% (3/85). One of the three HHV-8 DNA positive cases was seropositive as well. Twenty-five percent of the seropositive patients were female (6/24) and 75% were male (18/24). Of three HHV-8 DNA positive cases, two were male and one was female. The distribution of HHV-8 seropositivity rates according to the age groups were as follows; 1/3 for 1-10 years, 1/2 for 11-20 years, 3/8 for 21-30 years, 7/27 for 31-40 years, 9/30 for 41-50 years, 1/9 for 51-60 years, and 2/6 for 61-70 years. The highest seropositivity rate was detected in 41-50 age group (9/24, 37.5%), followed by 31-40 age group (7/24, 29.2%), presenting statistically significant differences between the other age groups (p< 0.05). HHV-8 DNA was detected in only 1 (4.2%) out of 24 IgG seropositive patients. HIV viral loads of the two HHV-8 seronegative patients whose HHV-8 DNA levels of < 500 copy/ml, were < 20 copy/ml and 1250 copy/ml, respectively. HIV-RNA load of the other patient with HHV-8 IgG positivity and 2240 copy/ml of HHV-8 DNA, was 191.000 copy/ml. None of the HIV-1 positive patients presented with clinical symptoms for KS. However, clinical and virological follow-up of those cases with HHV-8 IgG and/or DNA positivity would be useful to predict and control of a possible development of KS or other HHV-8-related pathologies. For a more comprehensive understanding of HHV-8 epidemiology in Turkey, multicentre studies with higher number of cases are needed. "
3986,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."

HBsAg and HBcAg were distributed uniformly among the lobules in 8 viral carriers with ""normal"" liver (NVC) and 30 patients with persistent hepatitis (PB) seropositive for HBcAg. This uniform staining pattern was quite distinct from the non-uniform and irregular patterns in 137 patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) associated with or not associated with cirrhosis. HBcAg was often found to be stained strongly in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus of hepatocytes in HBeAg-positive CAH, in contrast to NVC/PH, in which cytoplasmic HBcAg was very weak. Serum HBV DNA was detected in all 22 cases with HBeAg-positive NVC/PH, 41 of 46 (89.1%) cases with HBeAg-positive CAH, 6 of 23 (26.1%) casew with anti-HBe-positive CAH and none of 3 cases with anti-HBe-positive NVC/PH. The level of serum HBV DNA and staining of HBcAg were in decreasing order in these groups. While the presence of serum HBV DNA and HBcAg staining was always associated with HBeAg seropositivity in NVC/PH, this was not always found in CAH. Moreover, necroinflammatory activity in the liver did not always parallel viral replication in CAH. These findings seem to confirm that NVC/PH and CAH have different biologic processes; viral replication is always concordant in the former, but is sometimes discordant in the latter with HBeAg/anti-HBe status. The immunologic response of the host seems to suppress and distort replication of the virus to a varying degree among patients and areas of the same liver in CAH differently to that in NVC/PH. The different life cycle of the virus, including integration of viral DNA into the cellular genome, may subsequently result in discordant states of various virus markers in CAH."

We observed a case of genotypic ETVr with viral and biochemical breakthrough during ETV treatment of nucleoside-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A 57-years-old HBeAg-positive man received ETV 0.5 mg/day for 145 weeks. HBV DNA was 7.7 log10 copies/ml at baseline, decreased to below 2 at week 48, declined to a nadir of 0 (negative) at week 72, and rebounded to 2.2 log10 copies/ ml at week 90 and remained this level until 109 weeks and increased to 6.8 log10 copies/ml at week 145. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased to 440 IU/L at week 145. The ETVr-related substitution (rtS202P) and lamivudine resistance-related substitutions (rtL180M+rtM204V) were detected by DNA sequencing analysis at week 145. The patient discontinued ETV therapy at week 145, and then received 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Afterwards, HBV DNA level dropped to below 2.6 log10 copies/ml and ALT level was normalized after 19 weeks of TDF dosing. The three substitutions associated with ETV and lamivudine resistance developed after complete viral suppression in a nucleoside-naive CHB patient during ETV treatment. In spite of the extremely rare chance of viral mutation during ETV treatment, nucleoside-naive patients should be carefully monitored for resistance even if complete suppression is present."

Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."

In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."

Monotropic CCR5-using variants are found early in the infection while CXCR4-using variants may appear after progression to AIDS. CXCR4 use may consist of both monotropic and dualtropic viruses. The viral phenotype is important in evaluating the response to CCR5 inhibitors, a new class of antiviral drugs. The coreceptor use of HIV-1 was investigated using population sequencing in 24 patients from Botswana, carrying HIV-1 subtype C and failing antiretroviral treatment, while 26 treatment-naive patients acted as controls. Single genome sequencing was used to discern minor HIV-1 populations in the treatment-experienced group. The Geno2Pheno method was employed to predict the coreceptor use phenotype from HIV-1 env gp120 V3 DNA sequences. The glycan-charge model adjusted for subtype C was also used for phenotype prediction. The viral phenotype of population sequences was predicted using Geno2Pheno in 24/24 treatment-experienced patients, of whom eight (33%) were predicted to harbor CXCR4-using strains as compared to 2/26 in the treatment-naive group (p=0.03). Single genome sequencing generated 4-23 clones/patient in the treatment-experienced group. Altogether, 90/295 (31%) putative CXCR4-using clones were identified. In 10/24 (42%) treated patients at least one clone was predicted to be CXCR4-using, further increasing the amount of identified treatment-experienced patients with CXCR4 use. Although subtype C is usually associated with comparatively little CXCR4 use, the frequency of CXCR4 use in treatment-experienced patients with subtype C can be higher, which may have implications for the administration of CCR5 inhibitors in this patient group."

Of this total, 438 tested positive for HIV antibody (1.1%). Of these, 215 men returned for post test interview and physical exam and were compared with 1,348 men randomly selected HIV-1 seronegative men. None of the HIV-1 seropositive had a history of injecting drug use or had received blood transfusion in the past seven years. HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with the TPHA serological marker for syphylis > 1.160 (p = 0.015, odd ratio 1.8), history of urethritis (p = 0.009, odd ratio 1.92) (Table 4). This study found that HIV-1 seropositive men were mostly single, were likely to be from the rural northern provinces of Thailand or Bangkok. History of purchase of low-fee commercial sex and less condom use were significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity as was a history of STD in the year prior to interview. Information on HIV disease and pre-test/post test counselling is needed for Thai laborers who are applying for work abroad to countries which require HIV and syphylis screening. In this effort, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Public Health and the clinic for laborers going abroad should join forces to provide this service.

7695,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."

Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."

An 8-week open-label phase of N-3 PUFAs followed. Evaluation criteria were TG percent change at week 8, percentage of responders (normalization or > or =20% TG decrease), and safety issues. Ten patients with baseline TG levels >10 g/L were not randomized and received N-3 PUFAs as open treatment. The difference (PUFA - placebo) in TG percent change at week 8 was -24.6% (range: -40.9% to -8.4%; P = 0.0033), the median was -25.5% in the PUFA group versus 1% in the placebo group, and mean TG levels at week 8 were 3.4 +/- 1.8 g/L and 4.8 +/- 3.1 g/L, respectively.

Subsequently, the impact of polymorphism on resistance to therapy was studied in CRF01_AE-infected (n=29) and subtype B-infected (n=14) patients. At baseline, the differences between CRF01_AE and B strain were mainly observed in the minor mutations L10I/V, M36I and L63P/I/H (P<0.001, chi(2)). In the reverse transcriptase sequence, M41L and T215Y/S were more common in patients infected with subtype B virus (P<0.05, chi(2)). Although all patients treated with PI-based HAART had pre-existing minor mutations, a low prevalence of resistance to PIs was observed (5/43; 11.6%). Moreover, major mutations (D30N and N88D) conferring resistance to PIs were found in patients infected with subtype B strain. In conclusion, polymorphisms at the protease region may not reduce PI susceptibility during treatment. However, this study also revealed the difference in natural mutations among subtypes, which may affect the manifestation of drug resistance."

Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."

Forty men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or AIDS-related complex were treated with doses of 20, 30, 40, or 50 g orally twice daily for 8 weeks, and monitored for toxicity, disease progression, and with immunologic, virologic, and serum lipid profiles. The compound was found to be well tolerated over the broad range of doses examined; adverse reactions were confined to the gastrointestinal tract, of mild to moderate severity, and self-limited in duration. Modest weight gains observed on treatment were reversed within 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. While disease progression was not observed in this short-term study, we could find no indication of an immunorestorative or antiviral effect of AL 721, as determined by T-lymphocyte subset quantitation or HIV culture. All three patients who were HIV p24 antigenemic at entry retained positive antigen levels throughout treatment. As a consequence of therapy, however, significant increases in serum lipids were observed, including elevations in both triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. In conclusion, our experience on the largest group of HIV-infected patients treated with the highest doses of AL 721 provides no support for the use of this compound as an antiretroviral agent."

Bronchial lavage fluid yielded Pneumocystis carinii. The diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was suspected, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot tests were both negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Immunologic evaluation included the following results: a low normal CD4/CD8 ratio 0.88, CD4 lymphocytes 493/microL, and elevated IgA 539 mg/dL and IgM 175 mg/dL with normal IgG 492 mg/dL. Lymphocyte stimulation study results were depressed. Lymphocytes sent for culture were subsequently positive for HIV. The mother was HIV antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot but belonged to no high-risk group and was asymptomatic except for chronic diarrhea. The father was HIV antibody negative. The patient was treated with pentamidine and IV gamma-globulin with good clinical response and a rapid decrease of IgM and IgA toward normal values. Subsequent candidal pneumonia and candidal esophagitis were treated successfully with amphotericin B. The patient has received prophylactic IV gamma-globulin infusions for 6 months and remains HIV negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. This case of pediatric AIDS highlights the need to consider HIV infection in the differential diagnosis of any child with physical findings or illnesses suggestive of AIDS-related complex or AIDS, even when HIV serologic findings are negative and parents belong to no high-risk group. Parental testing for HIV antibody is suggested in such cases."
9894,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "

We examined the association of the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles with the emergence of mutations in the complete protease gene and the first 330 codons of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of HIV-1, studying their distribution and persistence and their impact on antiviral drug therapy. The clinical data for 179 HIV-infected patients, the results of HLA genotyping, and virus sequences were analyzed using a variety of statistical approaches. We describe new HLA-associated mutations in both viral protease and RT, several of which are associated with HLA-DRB1. The mutations reported are remarkably persistent within our cohort, developing more slowly in a minority of patients. Interestingly, several HLA-associated mutations occur at the same positions as drug resistance mutations in patient viruses, where the viral sequence was acquired before exposure to these drugs. The influence of HLA on thymidine analogue mutation pathways was not observed. We were able to confirm immune-driven selection pressure by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles through the identification of HLA-associated mutations. HLA-B alleles were involved in more associations (68%) than either HLA-A (23%) or HLA-DRB1 (9%). As several of the HLA-associated mutations lie at positions associated with drug resistance, our results indicate possible negative effects of HLA genotypes on the development of HIV-1 drug resistance."

Numerous strategies are being explored to eliminate this reservoir. To translate these efforts into clinical trials, there is a strong need for validated biomarkers that can monitor the reservoir over time in vivo. A comprehensive study was designed to evaluate and compare potential HIV-1 reservoir biomarkers. A cohort of 25 patients, treated with suppressive antiretroviral therapy was sampled at three time points, with median of 2.5 years (IQR: 2.4-2.6) between time point 1 and 2; and median of 31 days (IQR: 28-36) between time point 2 and 3. Patients were median of 6 years (IQR: 3-12) on ART, and plasma viral load (<50 copies/ml) was suppressed for median of 4 years (IQR: 2-8). Total HIV-1 DNA, unspliced (us) and multiply spliced HIV-1 RNA, and 2LTR circles were quantified by digital PCR in peripheral blood, at 3 time points. At the second time point, a viral outgrowth assay (VOA) was performed, and integrated HIV-1 DNA and relative mRNA expression levels of HIV-1 restriction factors were quantified. No significant change was found for long- and short-term dynamics of all HIV-1 markers tested in peripheral blood. Integrated HIV-1 DNA was associated with total HIV-1 DNA (p<0.001, R² = 0.85), us HIV-1 RNA (p = 0.029, R² = 0.40), and VOA (p = 0.041, R2 = 0.44). Replication-competent virus was detected in 80% of patients by the VOA and it correlated with total HIV-1 DNA (p = 0.039, R² = 0.54). The mean quantification difference between Alu-PCR and VOA was 2.88 log10, and 2.23 log10 between total HIV-1 DNA and VOA. The levels of usHIV-1 RNA were inversely correlated with mRNA levels of several HIV-1 restriction factors (TRIM5α, SAMHD1, MX2, SLFN11, pSIP1). Our study reveals important correlations between the viral outgrowth and total and integrated HIV-1 DNA measures, suggesting that the total pool of HIV-1 DNA may predict the size of the replication-competent virus in ART suppressed patients.

Two different HBV genotypes were identified in this patient. A search of the medical literature indicated this report is the first to describe a multiple silent HBV infection in an HIV/HCV-coinfected-patient. The elevated incidence of the anti-HBc alone pattern in HIV-positive patients and the increasing number of silent HBV infections detected in those patients demonstrate the need to carefully examine HIV-positive patients for occult HBV infection. In addition, it appears necessary to thoroughly study such patients in order to evaluate the impact of mixed HBV infection and triple HIV/HCV/HBV infection on morbidity."
9559,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses limit viral replication in untreated infection. After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."

This study aimed at reassessing the significance of 'anti-HBc alone' in unselected sera referred to the clinical laboratory and determining whether significant HBV viraemia can be found in this setting. Of the 6431 patients tested for HBsAg, total anti-HBc and anti-HBs in a Paris hospital over a 1-year period, 362 (5.6%) had 'anti-HBc alone' (24.8% of anti-HBc-positive patients). Only 11 of the 362 sera (3.0%) were found to be false positive. One patient was in the resolving phase of acute hepatitis B. HBV-DNA was detected in 10 of 362 (2.8%) patients, using a commercial standardized assay (threshold: 350 IU/mL). Viral loads exceeded 10(4) copies/mL in 6 of 10 patients. Mutations in the HBsAg immunodominant region were identified in seven of the viraemic patients. HBsAg was detected in only two cases when retested by one of the latest, multivalent assays. Neither human immunodeficiency virus nor hepatitis C virus serostatus distinguished between patients with and without HBV-DNA. In conclusion, 'anti-HBc alone' should be considered a risk marker for a so-called 'false occult' HBV infection with significant viraemia. Indeed, results in this hospital population indicate that a small proportion of patients with 'anti-HBc alone' have high viral loads, revealing the occurrence of infection with HBV mutants that escape detection even by multivalent HBsAg assays."
61,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Most current evidence suggests that the infection of resting CD4(+) T cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is not productive due to partial or complete blocks in the viral life cycle at steps prior to integration of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. However, stimulation of an infected resting T cell by antigen, cytokines, or microenvironmental factors can overcome these blocks and allow for the production of progeny virions. In this study, we sought to understand the structure and fate of the virus in unstimulated resting CD4(+) T cells. Using a novel linker-mediated PCR assay designed to detect and characterize linear unintegrated forms of the HIV-1 genome, we demonstrate that reverse transcription can proceed to completion following the infection of resting T cells, generating the substrate for the retroviral integration reaction. However, reverse transcription in resting T cells is far slower than in activated T cells, requiring 2 to 3 days to complete. The delay in completing reverse transcription may make the viral DNA genome more susceptible to competing decay processes. To explore the relationship between the formation of the linear viral genome and the stability of the preintegration state, we employed a recombinant HIV-1 virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein to measure the rate at which HIV-1 decays in the preintegration state. Our results demonstrate that the preintegration state is labile and decays rapidly (half-life = 1 day) following the entry of HIV-1 into a resting T cell, with significant decay occurring during the slow process of reverse transcription."

Indeed, quantitative molecular techniques have opened the way for a new type of direct study of untreated and treated HIV-1 infected subjects. The understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HIV-1 infection has increased significantly with the introduction of advanced virological and molecular methods for accurate quantitative analysis of HIV-1 activity; powerful methodologies answer (directly and in real time) most questions generated by pathogenic research and by the novel anti-viral strategies introduced in clinical practice. The data from pilot diagnostic applications of quantitative techniques have clarified important features of the natural history of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, an increasing amount of data indicate the need for second-level laboratory facilities for the clinical management of infected patients; virological aspects and some genetic features of the hosts concerning HIV-1 co-receptors (all the co-receptors so far identified are members of, or related to, the transmembrane, chemokine-receptor family) need to be elucidated for the complete diagnostic evaluation of HIV-1-infected subjects."

The objective of this study was to explore the prevalence of and risk factors for STIs among Korean adolescents under probation. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in one juvenile-delinquent center and five probation offices in Korea to determine the prevalence of STIs caused by the following pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Treponema pallidum, Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum. Of the 237 (208 male and 29 female) participating adolescents, 152 (64.1%) had a history of coitus. Overall, 133 (56.1%) subjects tested positive for at least one microorganism in their genitourinary tract. The most prevalent pathogen was U. urealyticum (24.7%, n = 65), followed by U. parvum (24.1%, n = 57), M. hominis (17.3%, n = 41), C. trachomatis (13.9%, n = 33), N. gonorrhoeae (1.7%, n = 4), T. vaginalis (0.8%, n = 2), and HSV (0.8%, n = 2). The prevalence of syphilis was 0.8% (n = 2). There were no reported cases of HIV infection. Fifty-four participants (35.5%) were positive with more than two pathogens. We did not find any significant difference between STIs and socioeconomic factors, behavioral factors or sexual practices. In conclusion, the prevalence of STIs among adolescents under probation was high. Systematic screening programs, more practical sexual education, and adequate provision of treatment are essential for the prevention and management of STIs among adolescents, especially those under probation."

Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."

The S region of HBV was amplified, and the HBV genotype and subtype were determined. The amino acid sequences of the S region were aligned, and mutations related to the failure of immunization and HBsAg detection were determined. Of the 245 samples, 228 (93 %) were genotyped successfully. We found that genotypes B, C, D and A accounted for 58.8 %, 21.9 %, 6.6 % and 3.95 % of the isolates, respectively.

This sero- and molecular epidemiology study was performed on patients in the Northeast of Iran, which is an endemic area for HTLV-I infection. A total of 109 sera were collected from HTLV-I positive healthy carriers who were admitted to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad City. All were tested for HBV serology and subsequently, real time PCR was carried out on the samples, regardless of the results of the serology. Standard PCR and direct sequencing were applied on positive samples. All cases were negative for HBsAg, Anti-HBc, and anti-HBs were positive in 34 (31.1%), and 35 (32%) individuals, respectively. There were 19 (17.4%) cases that were positive only for anti-HBs, and they had already received HBV vaccine. 16 (15%) were positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, indicating a past-resolved HBV infection. 18 (16.5%) were isolated as anti-HBc, and 56 (51.3%) were negative for all HBV serological markers. Only one subject (0.9%) had detectable HBV DNA (2153 copy/ml), and assigned as being an occult HBV infection. The low prevalence of HBsAg, despite the high percentage of anti-HBc positive cases, might be related to the suppression effect of HTLV-I on surface protein expression. The low prevalence of HBV infection among HTLV-I positive healthy carriers from an endemic region, indicates that the epidemiology of HTLV-I and HBV coinfection is related to the endemicity of HBV in that region, rather than HTLV-I endemicity."

GBV-C is not associated with any disease, but is associated with reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. Related viruses have been isolated from chimpanzees (GBV-Ccpz) and from New World primates (GB virus type A, GBV-A). These viruses are also capable of establishing persistent infection. We determined the nucleotide sequence encoding the envelope glycoprotein (E2) of two GBV-Ccpz isolates obtained from the sera of captive chimpanzees. The deduced GBV-Ccpz E2 protein differed from human GBV-C by 31 % at the amino acid level. Similar to human GBV-C E2, expression of GBV-Ccpz E2 in a tet-off human CD4(+) Jurkat T-cell line significantly inhibited the replication of diverse HIV-1 isolates. This anti-HIV-replication effect of GBV-Ccpz E2 protein was reversed by maintaining cells in doxycycline to reduce E2 expression. Previously, we found a 17 aa region within human GBV-C E2 that was sufficient to inhibit HIV-1. Although GBV-Ccpz E2 differed by 3 aa differences in this region, the chimpanzee GBV-C 17mer E2 peptide inhibited HIV-1 replication. Similarly, the GBV-A peptide that aligns with this GBV-C E2 region inhibited HIV-1 replication despite sharing only 5 aa with the human GBV-C E2 sequence. Thus, despite amino acid differences, the peptide region on both the GBV-Ccpz and the GBV-A E2 protein inhibit HIV-1 replication similar to human GBV-C. Consequently, GBV-Ccpz or GBV-A infection of non-human primates may provide an animal model to study GB virus-HIV interactions."

The recombinant prokaryotic expressive plasmid pYNenv was constructed by inserting the env DNA fragment which encode the gp120 of HIV-1 Yunnan strain into pBV220. The env DNA fragment was obtained by nested polymerase chain reaction with the HIV-1 infected patients peripheral blood macrophage and monocyte genomes from Yunan HIV-1 epidemic area as template.

The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli DH10b by pYNenv after vibration culture at 30 degrees C for 20 hours then at 42 degrees C for 5 hours and confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The protein can specifically react with the serum of HIV-1 infected patient from Yunan epidemic area by Western blot assay. The result showed that the recombinant protein can be used as antigen for detection of HIV-1 membrane glycoprotein antibody as well as for the further study of the role of envelope protein in pathology.

Since the nucleotide sequences of this region of the HCV genome has been shown to be highly conserved among different HCV isolates, the assay detecting the antibody to this expressed protein is useful for studying the pathogenicity of HCV. In this work, we investigated the presence of antibodies to HCV nucleocapsid protein (p22) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and compared its frequency with that of antibody to HCV non-structural protein (C-100), which is presently applied for blood screening for transfusion and diagnosis for chronic hepatitis C. By a sensitive Western blot analysis, 85 of 102 (83.3%) sera of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative HCC patients were positive for the antibody to p22 (anti-p22), whereas 68 of the same 102 cases (66.7%) were positive for the anti-C100 by ELISA. The prevalence of anti-p22 in 23 HBV carrier HCC patients, 56 patients with non-HCC cancer and 100 healthy blood donors were 4.3, 12.5 and 1.0%, respectively. Thus, high prevalence of anti-p22 in non-B HCC confirmed that HCV infection is closely related to the development of HCC. Furthermore, the anti-p22 assay can detect HCV-infected patients who could not previously be identified as such by the present anti-C100 assay."

Eighty-eight percent had pre-existing HAV immunity which was unaltered by chemotherapy. HDV infection was observed in 8% while HIV was conspicuous by its absence. Active HBV infection, observed in 76% of the children, was asymptomatic in the majority and was accompanied by a high incidence of HBe antigenaemia (57.9%) and its persistence. Pre-existing anti-HBs failed to prevent HBV infection recurrence, which was, however, transient and self-limiting. Multiple blood transfusions and repeated parenteral exposures appeared to be the possible sources of HBV acquisition. Transmission to close contacts was also observed. The study suggests that although HBV vaccine might not be protective against HBV infection in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, it may prevent its persistence and thereby help in reducing chronic liver disease-related morbidity and a highly infectious reservoir. Strict HBV screening of blood donors, exclusive use of disposable equipment, and vaccination of close contacts of cancer patients is recommended, particularly in HBV endemic third-world countries."

Five patients harboring subtype G strains were further classified within the IbNg recombinant clade. A high degree of genetic polymorphism at the protease gene was seen in all subtypes. Moreover, changes at positions associated with drug resistance were seen in subtype G viruses carried by patients who had not been exposed to protease inhibitors.

We prospectively evaluated 89 patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection at an urban medical center. Eighty-two patients received isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, with or without ethambutol, for 2 mo, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 7 mo. Seven patients received other regimens because of drug resistance or intolerance. Therapy was self-administered in 57 patients and directly observed in 32 cases. All patients showed rapid clinical improvement during the first month of therapy, and sputum cultures reverted to negative after 3 mo in 52 of 54 patients from whom specimens were obtained. Adverse reactions to isoniazid or rifampin prompted alterations in antituberculosis regimens in five patients (6%). Forty patients (45%) died during follow-up, and tuberculosis was a potential contributory cause of death in three cases. Treatment failure occurred in five patients (6%), four of whom were noncompliant with therapy. The fifty patient had an isoniazid-resistant organism. No relapses occurred in 916 patient-months of follow-up posttreatment. We thus conclude that the 9-mo regimen used for treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients is effective and well tolerated."
3637,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"HIV protease inhibitors, as components of combination antiretroviral drug regimens, have substantially reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. They selectively block the action of the virus-encoded protease and stop the virus from replicating. In general, these drugs have poor systemic bioavailability and must be dosed with respect to meals for optimal absorption. Protease inhibitor-containing regimens require ingestion of a large number of capsules, are costly, and produce or are susceptible to metabolic drug interactions. Simultaneous administration of two protease inhibitors takes advantage of beneficial pharmacokinetic interactions and may circumvent many of the drugs' undesirable pharmacologic properties. For example, ritonavir increases saquinavir concentrations at steady state by up to 30-fold, allowing reduction of saquinavir dose and dosing frequency. Ritonavir decreases the systemic clearance of indinavir and overcomes the deleterious effect of food on indinavir bioavailability. These benefits reflect inhibition of presystemic clearance and first-pass metabolism, as well as inhibition of systemic clearance mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. Several dual protease inhibitor combination regimens have shown great promise in clinical trials and are now recommended as components of salvage therapy for HIV-infected patients."
9715,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major public health problem worldwide. Until recently, interferon (IFN)-alpha was the only approved drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The recent registration of lamivudine, a dideoxycytidine analogue that inhibits both the HIV and HBV reverse transcriptases, has provided new perspectives for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Lamivudine treatment for 12 months leads to a control of viral replication during therapy in the majority of the patients and to sustained anti-hepatitis B e (anti-HBe) seroconversion in 16 to 22% of the patients, associated with a biochemical and histological response. Further studies showed that extended lamivudine therapy increases the rate of anti-HBe seroconversion. However, long-term therapy is associated with the progressive emergence of drug resistant mutants. In most cases these mutants are not associated with a deterioration of the liver disease within the available follow-up. In the remaining patients and in particular settings such as liver transplantation, a severe exacerbation of the liver disease is observed and that requires add-on therapy. Lamivudine treatment of patients infected with a pre-core mutant also showed beneficial effect with the control of viral replication, and a biochemical and histological response in approximately 60% of the patients at 1 year. These patients face the same problem of drug resistant mutants, and the optimal duration of lamivudine treatment still needs to be determined in this clinical situation. Moreover, lamivudine therapy is the only therapeutic option in decompensated cirrhotic patients to allow liver transplantation, and in liver transplant patients with HBV recurrence following transplantation. Adverse effects of lamivudine therapy are comparable to those observed in placebo-treated patients. ALT flares have been observed mainly in relation to the re-occurrence of viral replication due to the rebound of viral replication after therapy withdrawal, or to the emergence of drug resistance mutants. Therefore, lamivudine provides a new treatment alternative for patients with chronic HBV infection. For each patient, its indication has to be weighed against the risk of developing viral resistance but also against the risk of natural history of the disease."

The purpose is to describe the clinical and histological findings in an HIV-infected patient, who after being treated successfully for tuberculous lymphangitis 4 years ago, presented with a lingual ulcer as the only suggestive sign of recurrence of mycobacterial infection, probably M. tuberculosis. A 39-year-old man seen in the HIV clinic of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición ""Salvador Zubirán"" in Mexico City since 1991 for HIV infection. In 1999 the patient developed tuberculous lymphangitis; he was managed with a 4-drug regimen for 12 months, with improvement of local and systemic symptoms. In May of 2003, the patient presented a painful superficial lingual ulcer, 0.7 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, crateriform with slightly elevated, irregular and indurated borders, of 4 months duration. The histopathological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with giant multinucleated cells, suggestive of mycobacterial infection, and recurrence of TB was considered. Rifampin, isoniazide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were administered. The lingual lesion improved with partial healing at the first week and total remission at 45 days after the beginning of the antituberculous treatment. In June, 2003, the patient began highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) that included two NRTIs and one NNRTI. At 7 months of follow-up, the patient remains free of lingual lesions. The particularity of the present case is that the lingual ulcer was the only sign of infection by mycobacteria, suggestive of TB, in an HIV/AIDS patient that probably represented a recurrence of a previous episode."

In five infants hepatitis was the first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. The median age of onset of hepatitis was 7 months (range, 5 to 10 months). The mean total bilirubin concentration at presentation was 7.4 mg/dl (range, 3.9 to 11 mg/dl), the mean aspartate aminotransferase was 1512 IU/liter (range, 782 to 2960 IU/liter) and the mean alanine amino-transferase 512 IU/liter (range, 92 to 1247 IU/liter). The absolute CD4 count at the time of onset of hepatitis ranged from 191 to 2298 cells/mm3 (mean, 766 cells/mm3). Six of the seven children died within 12 weeks of onset of hepatitis, three as a result of complications of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and two died of complications secondary to cytomegalovirus. In only one infant was the cause of death the direct consequence of liver failure. The seventh infant died 17 months after the onset of hepatitis of dilated cardiomyopathy. No specific etiologic agent has been identified as the cause of cholestatic hepatitis in these infants. In situ hybridization studies to detect human immunodeficiency virus 1 messenger RNA was negative in the liver tissue obtained at biopsy and autopsy in five of the samples tested."

To exclude completely the possibility of MHC restriction of this cytotoxic activity, the in vitro cytotoxic potential of HIV-1 Nef against various CD4+ T cell lines as well as naive T lymphocytes was investigated using a baculovirus expression system. Insect cells expressing myristoylated Nef on their cell surface were shown to kill a proportion of CD4+ T cells within 8 h. However, N-terminal truncated and unmyristoylated Nef proteins were not present on the outer surface of insect cell membranes and failed to show any killing activity. Monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of Nef inhibited cytolysis. Thus, we conclude that specific Nef-mediated cytolysis is induced by contact with unprimed CD4+ T lymphocytes without MHC restriction."

Members of the Hsp family are mainly responsible for proper protein folding, however they perform many other functions in living organisms. Hsp60 is a molecular chaperone that is present in mitochondria and cytosol of eukaryotic cells, as well as on their surface. It is also found in the extracellular space and in the peripheral blood. Apart from its role in assisting protein folding in cooperation with Hsp10, Hsp60 contributes to regulation of apoptosis, as well as participates in modulation of the immune system activity. Hsp60 may favor oncogenesis by promoting survival or growth of some tumor cell types. Hsp60 is a subject of medical research due to its role in pathogenesis of certain tumors and infectious diseases. In this review we discuss mechanisms by which Hsp60 promotes development and progression of infections caused by three human viruses: hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza A virus."

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence in 1984-1985 and relationships of HDV and HBV infections in 372 unselected parenteral drug abusers without AIDS or symptoms related to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (but 49% of whom were positive for HIV-1 antibodies) and in 53 drug abusers hospitalized with AIDS. The prevalence of HDV markers in the combined study groups was 20%; 81% of study subjects with hepatitis B surface antigenemia (HBsAg) had one marker for HDV infection. Significant differences were found between patients with and without AIDS with respect to the prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen (5.7% vs. 0.8%, P less than .05) and antibody (0 vs. 21.4%, P less than .01) and HBsAg (15.1% vs. 5.1%, P less than .05). The significantly higher prevalence of hepatitis delta antigen and HBsAg in subjects with AIDS suggests that persistence or reactivation of these viruses is significantly greater among parenteral drug abusers with AIDS than among those without AIDS. These findings, along with the absence of hepatitis delta antibodies in the drug abusers with AIDS, are probably related to the profound general immunosuppression that occurs in AIDS."

A meta-analysis was conducted for 27 pairwise comparisons of antiretroviral treatments in 15 randomized trials of antiretroviral treatments. For each trial, three measures of treatment effect were used: (i) 16 week change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA; (ii) 16 week change from baseline in CD4 cell count; and (iii) rate of clinical progression. Treatments which caused greater increases in CD4 cell count and greater reductions in HIV-1 RNA were more effective at reducing the rate of clinical progression (P < 0.05 for each comparison). However, there was variability in the consistency of this correlation between different trials and treatments. The results support the use of both CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels as the primary markers of the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment."
6640,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The oligomeric nature of the viral envelope proteins has been partly held responsible for the observed differences in neutralization sensitivity between primary and laboratory-adapted strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, recent evidence suggests that host factors can also modify the sensitivity of HIV-1 particles to neutralization. Having previously demonstrated that the acquisition of host-encoded intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 proteins by newly formed viruses has a functional significance for the life cycle of HIV-1, we investigated whether the acquisition of host-derived ICAM-1 by HIV-1 could affect the virus sensitivity to neutralization. In this study, we have first shown that the physical presence of host cell membrane ICAM-1 on HIV-1 was not modifying virus sensitivity to neutralization by either two different anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies (0.5beta and 4.8D) or soluble CD4. However, the ability of the F105 anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody (specific for the CD4-binding site) to neutralize ICAM-1-bearing virions was diminished when target cells were pretreated with an lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-activating antibody. Interestingly, ICAM-1/POS progeny viruses were found to be slightly more resistant to neutralization by individual human sera in target cells expressing a low-affinity form of LFA-1 than viruses devoid of host-encoded ICAM-1 proteins. This resistance was markedly enhanced when target cells expressed an activated LFA-1 form on their surface. These results suggest that the interaction between virally embedded host ICAM-1 and target cell surface LFA-1 should be considered a factor modulating neutralization sensitivity of HIV-1 by human sera from HIV-1-infected individuals."

Sera were tested for antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), immunoglobulin M anti-HBc (IgM anti-HBc), antibody to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV), antibody to HTLV type 1 (anti-HTLV 1), and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). The prevalence of anti-HAV was 13.2% in drug abusers and 10.8% in controls (not significant). The prevalences of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc and exposure rate to hepatitis B virus (HBV) were 4.4%, 24.2%, 31.9%, and 35.2%, respectively, in drug abusers and 0.8%, 6.7%, 9.6%, and 9.6% in controls. The exposure rate to HBV was significantly different (P less than 0.001). IgM anti-HBc and anti-HDV were not detected in any sera. Anti-HTLV I was detected in three drug abusers (3.3%) and in one (0.2%) of the controls (P less than 0.01). All sera were negative for anti-HIV in all subjects. Infection with HBV and HTLV I is more common among drug abusers than in the general population of blood donors in Japan."

The available data from clinical studies suggest that HIV infection modulates the HBV-specific T cell response. However, the virological and molecular aspects of HIV-HBV coinfection are currently poorly understood due to the lack of appropriate model systems. In this study, the effect of HIV infection on the life cycle of HBV was explored using an in vitro model system. The present data show that the extracellular and intracellular hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and e antigen (HBeAg) decrease significantly in HepG2 cells cotransfected with HIV NL4-3 and pHBV1.3 as compared to those cells transfected only with pHBV1.3. Moreover, a significant decrease in HBV DNA and mRNA expression was also observed in the cotransfected cells. HIV Rev protein, an RNA-bound regulatory protein, could significantly decrease the expression levels of extracellular and intracellular HBsAg and HBeAg by mediating the expression of HBV mRNA in cells cotransfected with plasmids containing HIV-1 Rev and pHBV1.3. Further experiments demonstrate that HIV Rev manipulated neither the promoters of HBV nor the nuclear export of HBV mRNA. These results from the in vitro model system might provide clues to further understand the rapid progression of liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected patients."

Serological analysis was performed by using an immunofluorescence assay able to detect anti-latent and anti-lytic HHV-8 antibodies. Twelve acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) patients and 94 blood donors were tested as reference population groups. Anti-lytic antibodies were detected in 185 (48.8%) individuals; 52 of them (13.7%) also had anti-latent antibodies. Both anti-lytic and anti-latent antibody prevalence were higher among homosexual men (66.9% and 27.7%, respectively) than among IDU (49.1% and 8.0%, respectively) and non-IDU heterosexuals (31.4% and 5.1%, respectively), and tended to increase with age. Anti-lytic HHV-8 antibodies were associated with syphilis [odds ratio (OR)=3.81] but not with hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositivity. HIV-infected homosexual men were more likely to have HHV-8 antibodies than those who were HIV-negative. When using anti-latent antibodies the direction of the OR remained the same, although the associations did not often reach statistical significance. Among AIDS-KS patients, 83.3% had anti-lytic and 66.6% had anti-latent antibodies. Among blood donors, 28% had anti-lytic antibodies and 2 of them (2.1%) also had anti-latent antibodies. Our data indicate that HHV-8 seroprevalence increases with age and is higher among homosexual men, particularly those infected with HIV. This is consistent with sexual transmission of HHV-8 infection. In addition, the presence of HHV-8 antibodies in HIV-negative non-IDU heterosexual contacts and in healthy blood donors is consistent with the high incidence of classic KS in Italy."

Most recently, investigators discussed the likelihood of gene-reshuffling following SV40 infection as a precursor to acquired immune dysfunction. Findings of recent SV40 infections in four children born after 1982 suggest infections were transmitted vertically along gene lines. Earlier observations proved activation of a retrovirus gene by a hepatitis B virus (HBV) protein. This paper proposes a new integrative theory on the origin of AIDS. It advances the possibility of genetic recombinations with oncogene activation by HBV involving simian viruses that likely infected polio vaccinated blood donors to the initial hepatitis B (HB) vaccine trials conducted on gay men in New York City and Ugandan Blacks in the early to mid-1970s. The socio-economic and even military ramifications associated with this politically challenging thesis are discussed."

In this study, genetic diversity and viral load of HIV-1 in the seminal compartments and blood of Chinese MSM with early HIV-1 infection were examined. Viral load and genetic diversity of HIV-1 in paired samples of semen and blood were analyzed in seven MSM with early HIV-1 infection. HIV-1 RNA and DNA were quantitated by real-time PCR assays. Through sequencing the C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene, the HIV-1 genotype and genetic diversity based on V3 loop amino acid sequences were determined by using Geno2pheno and PSSM programs co-receptor usage. It was found that there was more HIV-1 RNA in seminal plasma than in blood plasma and total, and more 2-LTR circular and integrated HIV-1 DNA in seminal cells than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all seven patients with early HIV-infection. There was also greater HIV-1 genetic diversity in seminal than in blood compartments. HIV-1 in plasma displayed higher genetic diversity than in cells from the blood and semen. In addition, V3 loop central motifs, which present some key neutralizing antibody epitopes, varied between blood and semen. Thus, virological characteristics in semen may be more representative when evaluating risk of transmission in persons with early HIV infection."

A Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD4+ cell counts and counteracts the Th1 to Th2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased risk of premature delivery reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Th1) and IL-10 (Th2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL-2-PHA, IL-2-Env, IL-10-PHA and IL-10-Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL-2 and decreased IL-10. HAART use and IL-10-Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL-2-PHA slope was associated with an 8% increased risk of premature delivery (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.0-1.17; p=0.005). HAART use in pregnancy provides significant benefits in delaying HIV disease progression and reducing the risk of mother-to-child-transmission, but may be counterproductive in terms of successful pregnancy outcome."

The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."

Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use.* U.S. birth certificate data were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009-2014. Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. During 2009-2014, HCV infection present at the time of delivery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the birth certificate increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1,000 live births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1,000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection were approximately threefold higher among women residing in rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials should consider individual and population-level opportunities for prevention and risk mitigation."
9704,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is intricately related to the activation state of the host cells supporting viral replication. Although cellular activation is essential to mount an effective host immune response to invading pathogens, paradoxically the marked systemic immune activation that accompanies HIV-1 infection in vivo may play an important role in sustaining phenomenal rates of HIV-1 replication in infected persons. Moreover, by inducing CD4+ cell loss by apoptosis, immune activation may further be central to the increased rate of CD4+ cell turnover and eventual development of CD4+ lymphocytopenia. In addition to HIV-1-induced immune activation, exogenous immune stimuli such as opportunistic infections may further impact the rate of HIV-1 replication systemically or at localized anatomical sites. Such stimuli may also lead to genotypic and phenotypic changes in the virus pool. Together, these various immunological effects on the biology of HIV-1 may potentially enhance disease progression in HIV-infected persons and may ultimately outweigh the beneficial aspects of antiviral immune responses. This may be particularly important for those living in developing countries, where there is little or no access to antiretroviral drugs and where frequent exposure to pathogenic organisms sustains a chronically heightened state of immune activation. Moreover, immune activation associated with sexually transmitted diseases, chorioamnionitis, and mastitis may have important local effects on HIV-1 replication that may increase the risk of sexual or mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1. The aim of this paper is to provide a broad review of the interrelationship between immune activation and the immunopathogenesis, transmission, progression, and treatment of HIV-1 infection in vivo."

During the 16-year study period 3,894 PML deaths were reported. The age-adjusted death rate increased more than 20-fold, from less than 0.2 per million persons before 1984 to 3.3 per million persons in 1994. The increase was attributable to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which was recorded on 2,267 (89.0%) of 2.546 death records from 1991 through 1994. PML age-adjusted death rates increased abruptly for all males beginning in 1984 and for black females in 1990. Only a small increase was observed for white females. In 1994, PML was reported in 2.1% of white males who died with HIV-associated disease compared with 1.2% of white females and 1.0% of black males and females who died of similar causes. The epidemic of PML deaths is increasing in parallel with the AIDS epidemic. The increase in HIV-associated PML deaths, first noted among males, has also become apparent among females and probably reflects the increasing importance of drug use and heterosexual transmission of HIV. The reason for the higher prevalence of PML among white males with HIV infection is unknown."

Over 60 months of observation, there was a significant increase in mean creatinine levels from baseline (P<.01) that was not significantly different between the two study groups. Moreover, a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed from baseline (P<.01), and it was significantly greater in HBV mono-infected than co-infected patients (P=.03).

To compare the mean number of rejections and the mean number of infections between the two groups, we used multivariate linear regression analysis, which allowed us to adjust simultaneously for the effects of 10 other risk variables with potential impact on graft rejection and posttransplant infection. During a mean follow up of 5.3+/-5.2 years, 62% of hepatitis patients and 54% of control patients had experienced an acute rejection (P=NS). The mean rejections/patient in the hepatitis group was 1.3+/-0.14 versus 1.03+/-0.03 in control (P=NS). In the linear regression analysis, the number of acute rejections in the hepatitis group was 0.16 higher than in control (P=NS). With reference to infection, 84% of hepatitis patients experienced an infectious complication in the posttransplant period, compared with 75% in the control (P=0.05). The mean number of infections/patient was 5.7+/-0.73 in the hepatitis group compared with 3.9+/-0.14 in the control group (P=0.002). The linear regression model had shown that the hepatitis group had a relative increase of 1.18 infections/pt, compared with control. Of the different sites of infection, the hepatitis group had a significant increase in bloodstream (0.48+/-0.08 vs. 0.25+/-0.02) P=0.003; pulmonary (0.60+/-0.09 vs. 0.38+/-0.03) P=0.03; and CNS infections (0.08+/-0.03 vs. 0.02+/-0.004) P=0.05 compared with control. Among the different microorganisms causing infection, the hepatitis patients had a significant increase in gram negative bacterial infections compared with the control group (74% vs. 61%) P=0.04. Our data suggest that chronic viral hepatitis is associated with a significant increase in overall infections, and that of potentially fatal infections involving CNS, lungs and bloodstream. Since there is no significant increase in the rate of graft rejection, one could consider a cautious reduction in the doses of maintenance immunosuppressive agents in renal transplant patients with chronic viral hepatitis. The reduced immunosuppression may in turn lower the death rate from sepsis and progressive hepatic failure."

Improvements were found in the behavioral skills required to properly adhere to HIV medication regimens. Enhancements were found in all measured aspects of sex-risk reduction outcomes, including HIV knowledge, motivation to reduce sex-risk behavior, behavioral skills related to engaging in reduced sexual risk, and reduced risk behavior. Improvements in drug use outcomes included enhancements in risk reduction skills as well as reduced heroin and cocaine use. Intervention effects also showed durability from post-intervention to the follow-up assessment point. Females responded particularly well in terms of improvements in risk reduction skills and risk behavior. This study suggests that an evidence-based behavioral intervention may be successfully adapted for use in community-based clinical settings where HIV-infected drug users can be more efficiently reached."

A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."

This longitudinal study examined mental health, substance abuse, and psychosocial predictors of long-term adherence to antiretroviral medications and medical appointments among HIV-seropositive mothers recruited from an infectious disease clinic of a large urban medical center. Individual interviews were conducted at baseline and two follow-up points, 8 to 18 months after enrollment. Based on a model of health behavior, we examined psychiatric and psychosocial predictors of adherence to antiretroviral medications and medical appointments over time. Presence of a psychiatric disorder, negative stressful life events, more household members, and parenting stress were significantly associated with both missed pills and missed medical appointments at follow-up. Baseline substance abuse was associated with missed pills at follow-up and lack of disclosure to family members at baseline was associated with missed medical appointments at follow-up. These findings suggest that interventions that integrate mental health, substance abuse and medical care may be important to improving the medical adherence and health of HIV-seropositive women, particularly in multistressed populations with substantial caregiving and other life demands."

Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence.

Youth who were infected through perinatal transmission enter into adolescence often with a history of multiple medication regimens. Thus, adherence can be a particularly important issue in these young people, as medication options can often be limited. This was a cross-sectional, observational study to determine the prevalence of personal barriers to adherence and to identify associations among the following barriers in subjects 12 to 24 years old: mental health barriers, self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, and structural barriers. Among the 368 study participants, 274 (74.5%) were adherent and 94 (25.5%) were nonadherent to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). No significant differences were found between adherent and nonadherent subjects according to mental health disorders. Adherence was associated with some but not all structural barriers. Both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were significantly higher in adherent versus nonadherent subjects (p < 0.0001). In subjects with low self-efficacy and outcome expectancy, adherence differed according to the presence or absence of either mental health or structural barriers, similar to findings in behaviorally- infected adolescents. Interventions that address the breadth and clustering of adherence barriers in adolescents are needed to have the maximum chance for positive effects."

We thus questioned which factors influenced the occurrence of fibrosis in a cohort of HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients. HIV/HCV coinfected intravenous drug user patients naive of anti-HCV therapy for whom a liver biopsy was performed between 1996 and 2003 were retrospectively studied in three University hospitals in Paris and the Parisian region. One hundred and fifty two patients (131 men and 21 women; mean age 39.3+/-4.9 years) were studied. Most of them (62%) were treated with HAART. HCV genotypes included type 1 (N=78), type 2 (N=1), type 3 (N=38) and type 4 (N=35). Mean duration of HCV infection was 19.0+/-5.2 years. Sixty-six percent had minimal to moderate fibrosis (F0/F1/F2) and 34% severe fibrosis (F3/F4). Multivariate analysis retained METAVIR activity score (OR=2.60, 95%CI [1.46-4.64]; P=0.001), mixed pattern of steatosis (OR=3.29, 95%CI [1.24-8.71]; P=0.017) and a CD4 cell count<200/mm3 (OR=4.04, 9%CI [1.47-11.12]; P=0.007) as independent factors associated with severe fibrosis.

The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients.

Testin the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) is the standard technique used to evaluate T-helper response, but its use in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting can be problematic. The most promising new alternative technique is the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency by flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokine production after short-term antigen-specific activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HCMV-specific LPR and CD4(+) T-cell frequency were compared in a group of 78 blood samples from 65 HIV-infected patients. The results showed concordance in 80.7% of samples. In addition, comparative analysis of sequential blood samples from 13 HIV-infected patients showed that while in about half of patients the T-helper HCMV-specific immune response remained stable during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in the other half declining levels of the HCMV-specific CD4(+)-mediated immune response were determined by either one or both assays. In conclusion, our data suggest that the determination of HCMV-specific CD4(+) T-cell frequency can be considered a valuable alternative to the LPR test for the detection of HCMV-specific T-helper response in HIV-infected patients. It could facilitate wider screening of anti-HCMV T-helper activity in HIV-infected patients, with potential benefits for clinicians in deciding strategies of discontinuation or maintenance of anti-HCMV therapy."

Pituitary growth hormone (GH) secretion seems to be altered in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and about one-third of patients have biochemical GH deficiency (GHD). We undertake a historical review of the functioning of the GH/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) axis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and provide an overview of the main changes of the GH/IGF-1 axis occurring today in patients with HIV. Both spontaneous GH secretion and GH response to provocative stimuli are reduced in patients with HIV infection, especially in those with HIV-related lipodystrophy. The role of fat accumulation on flattened GH secretion is discussed, together with all factors able to potentially interfere with the pituitary secretion of GH. Several factors contribute to the development of GHD, but the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the genesis of GHD are complex and not yet fully elucidated owing to the difficulty in separating the effects of HIV infection from those of HAART, comorbidities and body changes. An update on the putative mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of altered GH secretion in these patients is provided, together with an overview on the therapeutic strategies targeting the GH/IGF-1 axis to counteract fat redistribution associated with HIV-related lipodystrophy. The clinical significance of GHD in the context of HIV infection is discussed. The administration of tesamorelin, a GH releasing hormone analogue, is effective in reducing visceral fat in HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. This treatment is promising and safer than treatment with high doses of recombinant human growth hormone, which has several side-effects."
1277,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication is linked to cellular gene transcription and requires target cell activation. The latent reservoir of HIV-1 in quiescent T cells is thought to be a major obstacle to clearance of infection by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Thus, identification of agents that can induce expression of latent virus may, in the presence of HAART, allow elimination of the infected cells by the immune response. We previously used the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) mouse model to establish that activation-inducible HIV can be generated at high frequency during thymopoiesis. Latently infected mature thymocytes can be exported into the periphery, providing an efficient primary cell model to determine cellular activation signals that induce renewed expression of latent virus. Here we characterized the effects of prostratin, a non-tumor-promoting phorbol ester, on primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and assessed its ability to reactivate latent HIV infection from thymocytes and PBLs in the SCID-hu (Thy/Liv) model. Prostratin stimulation alone did not induce proliferation of quiescent PBLs; however, it could provide a secondary signal in the context of T-cell receptor stimulation or a primary activation signal in the presence of CD28 stimulation to induce T-cell proliferation. While prostratin alone was not sufficient to allow de novo HIV infection, it efficiently reactivated HIV expression from latently infected cells generated in the SCID-hu mouse. Our data indicate that prostratin alone is able to specifically reactivate latent virus in the absence of cellular proliferation, making it an attractive candidate for further study as an adjunctive therapy for the elimination of the latent HIV reservoir."

This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."

Although, the natural course of HIV does not appear altered by HBV, the rate of liver-related deaths is several times higher among HIV/HBV co-infected persons. Clinicians providing care for HIV positive individuals, including pregnant women, need to be aware of this problem. This is a 2-year cross-sectional study that commenced in January 2006, among HIV positive pregnant women seen at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. During the study period, 721 HIV positive pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B virus infection. Sixty-four women (8.9%) were positive for HBsAg, 14(1.9%) were HCV positive and 642 (89.2%) were negative for both HBV and HCV. One patient was positive forboth HBV and HCV. There were no remarkable differences between HIV infected and HIV-HBV coinfected patients in terms of the hematological, albumin and bilirubin measurements. Alanine transaminase was however higher in the HIV-HBV co-infected patients than HIV patients and this was statistically significant (17.5 iu/ ml vs. 15.0 iu/ml, p value--0.009). In addition, the CD4 cell count was lower and the viral load marginally higher in the hepatitis B virus positive patients. The differences were however not statistically significant (p value--0.114 and 0.644 respectively). HIV-HBV co-infection in HIV positive pregnant women is not of negligible proportions as demonstrated in this study. Thus, HIV positive pregnant women should be screened for HBV and assisted to access care targeted at preventing morbidity and vertical transmission."

In this study, we examined human sera for the presence of alternatively spliced soluble IL-6R (AS-sIL-6R). We produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the unique sequence of AS-sIL-6R peptide, generated by an altered reading frame. We also made recombinant AS-sIL-6R protein in Spodoptera frugiperda-9 (Sf-9) cells carrying baculovirus, which encoded altered sIL-6R or conventional IL-6R cDNA. mAbs specifically recognized AS-sIL-6R, but not conventional IL-6R, as demonstrated by Western blot analyses, fluorescence-activated cell sorter, immunofluorescence analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We adapted an ELISA system and used it for detection of altered sIL-6R in sera from 23 healthy persons, 12 patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and 13 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). Serum levels of AS-sIL-6R were 6.4 or 6.1 times greater in ATL (28.7+/-20.4 ng/ml, P<0.0001) and in HAM patients (27.5+/-12.1 ng/ml, P<0.0001) than in healthy individuals (4.5+/-2.1 ng/ml). High levels of AS-sIL-6R were also observed in plasma from rheumatoid arthritis patients and in persons with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), antinuclear antibody (ANA), or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). However, in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals, AS-sIL-6R levels were not elevated. In this study, we confirmed that AS-sIL-6R is indeed present in human sera. These observations suggest that alternative splicing of IL-6R mRNA is of consequence in ATL, HAM and in some autoimmune diseases. The HTLV-I-infected T cells appeared to play an important role in AS-sIL-6R production."

Recent studies suggest that extracellular Tat is partially sequestered by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. As a consequence, Tat is concentrated on the cell surface and protected from proteolytic degradation, thus remaining in a biologically active form. We show that Tat binds the surfaces of both HIV-1-infected and surrounding uninfected cells. We provide evidence for a specific interaction between Tat and the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) envelope protein, which enhances virus attachment and entry into cells. We map the interacting sites of both Tat and gp120 and show that synthetic peptides mimicking the gp120 site inhibit HIV-1 infection. Our data demonstrate that membrane-associated Tat is a novel modulator of virus entry and suggest that the Tat-gp120 interaction represents a critical step in HIV-1 spreading during the course of infection."

Short-term exposure of the chronically infected promyelocytic OM10 cell line with the PTK inhibitor genistein induced a dose-dependent increase in p24 antigen production in culture supernatants. This induction persisted in the presence of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor, zidovudine, and was associated with an increased transcription of HIV-1 multiply spliced and unspliced RNAs, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism targeting the integrated provirus. Genistein induced cell differentiation, apoptosis, and a G2 arrest in the OM10 cells. Cell differentiation and apoptosis were not directly involved in the observed increase in HIV-1 replication that was closely linked to genistein-induced G2 arrest. Alleviation of the G2 arrest by pentoxyfylline resulted in a concomitant reduction of HIV-1 to baseline replication. Additionally, by flow cytometry, a significant increase in the number of p24 antigen-expressing cells was observed in cells arrested in G2 compared to those located in G1 or S. Tyrosine kinase inhibition was found not to be essential for enhanced viral replication, which seemed to be related to two other properties of genistein, inhibition of topoisomerase II activity and inhibition of phosphotidylinositol turnover. These findings are consistent with the recent observation that HIV-1 Vpr induces viral replication through preventing proliferation of cells by arresting them in G2 of the cell cycle and strongly suggest that manipulation of the cell cycle plays an important role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."

Our studies focused on SHIVSF33, which contains the vpu, tat, rev, and env genes of the cytopathic, T-cell line tropic clone HIV-1sf33 (subtype-B); this clone has a premature stop codon in the vpu gene. In three juvenile macaques inoculated intravenously with SHIVSF33, low-level persistent infection was established; no disease was observed for a period of >2 years. However, at approximately 16 months p.i., one of four SHIVSF33-infected juvenile macaques exhibited an increase in virus load, depletion of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes, and other symptoms of simian AIDS (SAIDS). Virus recovered from this animal in the symptomatic stage was designated SHIVSF33a (A, adapted); this virus displayed multiple amino acid sequence changes throughout the HIV-1 env gene compared with the input SHIVSF33 clone. Additionally, a mutation in all clones from SHIVSF33a restored the open reading frame for the vpu gene. In vitro evaluations in tissue-culture systems revealed that SHIVSF33a replicated to higher levels and exhibited greater cytopathicity than SHIVSF33. Furthermore cloned env genes for SHIVSF33a were more fusogenic in a cell-fusion assay compared with the env gene of the SHIVSF33. Intravenous inoculation of SHIVsf33a into juvenile and newborn macaques resulted in a rapid decline in CD4(+) T cells to very low levels and development of a fatal AIDS-like disease. A cell-free preparation of this pathogenic chimeric virus also established persistent infection when applied to oral mucosal membranes of juvenile macaques and produced a fatal AIDS-like disease. These studies on pathogenic SHIVSF33a establish the basis for further investigations on the role of the HIV-1 env gene in virus adaptation and in mechanism(s) of immunodeficiency in primates; moreover, the chimeric virus SHIVSF33a can play a role in elucidating mucosal membrane transmission and development of antiviral vaccines in newborns as well as juvenile and adult macaques."
8060,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. The pre-S2 mutant large HBV surface protein (Δ2 LHBS), which contains an in-frame deletion of approximately 17 amino acids in LHBS, is highly associated with risks and prognoses of HBV-induced HCC. It was previously reported that Δ2 LHBS interacts with the Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (JAB1), a zinc metalloprotease. This promotes the degradation of the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1) and is believed to be the major mechanism for Δ2 LHBS-induced HCC. In this study, it was found that the interaction between JAB1 and Δ2 LHBS is facilitated by divalent metal Zn(2+) ions. The binding of JAB1 to Δ2 LHBS requires the JAB1/CSN5 MPN metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif and residue H138 that binds to Zn(2+) ions in JAB1. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that Δ2 LHBS binds directly to Zn(2+) ions in a two-site binding mode. Residues H71 and H116 in Δ2 LHBS, which also contact Zn(2+) ions, are also indispensable for Δ2 LHBS-mediated p27(Kip1) degradation in human HuH7 cells. These results suggest that developing drugs that interrupt interactions between Δ2 LHBS and JAB1 can be used to mitigate Δ2 LHBS-associated risks for HCC. "

Transient expression of this truncated env gene in primate cells resulted in the biosynthesis of two proteins with M(r)s of 52,000 and 41,000, respectively. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies to the HIV-1 TM protein indicated that the intracellular and surface localization of these proteins were indistinguishable from those of the native HIV-1 gp120-gp41 complex. These results indicate that the oligosaccharide processing and cell surface transport of the HIV-1 TM protein were not dependent on the presence of the receptor binding subunit, gp120. Syncytium formation was readily detected upon expression of the deleted HIV-1 env gene into COS and CD4+ HeLa cell lines, suggesting that in the absence of gp120, the TM protein retained biological activity. This observation was confirmed by infection of primate and mouse cell lines with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vvgp41) expressing the truncated HIV-1 env gene. These results strongly suggest that (i) the two biological activities of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein can occur independently and (ii) the association of the two glycoprotein subunits may restrict the fusion activity of the transmembrane component to CD4+ cells."

However, the mechanism by which Nef activates Pak2 is poorly understood. Mutations in most Nef motifs previously reported to be required for Pak2 activation (G2, PxxP72, and RR105) also affect other Nef functions, such as CD4 or major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) downregulation. To better understand Nef interactions with Pak2, we performed mutational analysis of three primary HIV-1 Nef clones that exhibited similar capacities for downregulation of CD4 and MHC-I but variable abilities to associate with activated Pak2. Our results demonstrate that Nef amino acids at positions 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 (L, H, S, R, and F in the clade B consensus, respectively) are critical for Pak2 association. Mutation of these Nef residues dramatically altered association with Pak2 without affecting Nef expression levels or CD4 and MHC-I downregulation. Furthermore, compensation occurred at positions 89 and 191 when both amino acids were substituted. Since residues 85, 89, 187, 188, and 191 cluster on the surface of the Nef core domain in a region distinct from the dimerization and SH3-binding domains, we propose that these Nef residues form part of a unique binding surface specifically involved in association with Pak2. This binding surface includes exposed and recessed hydrophobic residues and may participate in an as-yet-unidentified protein-protein interaction to facilitate Pak2 activation."

Recent evidence suggests that HBV has evolved strategies to block the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 to limit IFN-α-induced cellular antiviral responses. However, it remains unclear whether STAT1 translocation is impaired in chronic hepatitis B patients and what mechanisms are involved. Here we report that the expression of HBV polymerase (Pol) in human hepatic cell lines inhibited induction of IFN-stimulated genes and resulted in a weakened antiviral activity of IFN-α. Ectopic expression of Pol suppressed IFN-α-induced STAT1 serine 727 phosphorylation and STAT1/2 nuclear accumulation, whereas STAT1 tyrosine 701 phosphorylation, and STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer formation were not affected. Further studies demonstrated that Pol interacted with the catalytic domain of protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ) and perturbed PKC-δ phosphorylation and its association with STAT1, which resulted in the suppression of STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation. Moreover, Pol was found to interfere with nuclear transportation of STAT1/2 by competitively binding to the region of importin-α5 required for STAT1/2 recruitment. Truncation analysis suggested that the terminal protein and RNase H domains of Pol were able to bind to PKC-δ and importin-α5, respectively, and were responsible for the inhibition of IFN-α signaling. More importantly, the inhibition of STAT1 and PKC-δ phosphorylation were confirmed in a hydrodynamic-based HBV mouse model, and the blockage of IFN-α-induced STAT1/2 nuclear translocation was observed in HBV-infected cells from liver biopsies of chronic HBV patients."

Most GNs that occur in HIV patients are immune complex mediated, often with concurrent infections such as hepatitis B or C. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN), a rare primary glomerular disease, has only been reported in 2 HIV patients, and both patients had concurrent hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Here we report a unique case of FGN with unusual ultrastructural morphology in an HIV-positive African American patient without concurrent HCV infection. The patient presented with nephrotic range proteinuria and renal insufficiency. A percutaneous kidney biopsy showed mesangial and segmental endocapillary proliferative GN with crescent formation. Immunofluorescence studies revealed IgG-, κ-, and C3-positive deposits in the mesangium and capillary loops. Electron microscopy demonstrated diagnostic features of FGN: randomly-arranged fibrillary deposits with a diameter of 15 - 30 nm. The deposits had an unusual distribution pattern of hump-like large deposits on the subepithelial aspect. Additionally, smaller deposits were also present in the mesangium. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of FGN in an HIV patient without concurrent HCV infection. ."

PVL levels usually show a 1- to 2-log reduction within four to six weeks after therapy is started. The goal is no detectable virus in 16 to 24 weeks. Periodic monitoring of PVL is important to promptly identify treatment failure. When feasible, the same assay should be used for serial PVL testing in the individual patient. At least two PVL measurements usually should be performed before antiretroviral drug therapy is initiated or changed. PVL testing may be helpful in the rare instance of indeterminate HIV antibody testing, especially in a patient with recent infection."

We used the data from a 5-year longitudinal study of the MANIF 2000 cohort of individuals infected with HIV (as a result of injection drug use) and receiving HAART to investigate the predictors of long-term virological success. Design. Data were collected every 6 months from outpatient hospital services delivering HIV care in France. We selected all patients who were receiving HAART for at least 6 months (baseline visit) and who had indications for OST (ie, still dependent on opioids). We selected a total of 113 patients, accounting for a total of 562 visits for all the analyses."

The epidemiology of IRIS in Thailand has not been well examined, especially among adult HIV-infected patients. In the present study, we reviewed the medical records of 174 HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients older than 15 years (the median CD4 count at commencement of HAART was 37 cells/mm3) and compared characteristics of patients with and without IRIS. During a 12-month follow-up period after commencement of HAART, 11 cases (6.3%) of IRIS were identified (4.2/100 patient-years HAART). The cases included nine cases with mycobacterial infection, one with cytomegalovirus retinitis and one with cryptococcal meningitis. The patients with IRIS were significantly younger than those without IRIS (29 vs 36 on medians, p = 0.022). The median interval between commencement of HAART and the onset of IRIS was 22 days. Although all patients with IRIS improved with or without corticosteroids, they were more frequently hospitalized during a 12-month follow-up period while taking HAART (1 vs 0 on medians, p < 0.001). The incidence of IRIS in advanced adult HIV-infected patients in Thailand was lower than that reported from Europe and the United States, which may be attributable to deferment of HAART after diagnosing opportunistic infections."
6094,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."

Immune activation can release neurotoxic chemicals including cytokines, free radicals, autocoids, and hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related neurodegeneration was addressed. Activities of four lysosomal hydrolases were assayed in the frontal lobe of 69 males who died with AIDS and 31 age-matched control men. Activities of all four enzymes were increased significantly (1.6 to 3.6 times) in white matter of patients with AIDS. Less pronounced increases were present in cerebral cortex. Of 69 of the subjects with AIDS, 50 (72%), had at least one abnormally active enzyme. Patients with HIV encephalitis and other neuropathological changes were affected as were many subjects without any clear neuropathological anomaly. Lysosomal cathepsin D immunostaining revealed increased lysosomes within perivascular macrophages, multinucleated cells, activated microglial cells, and hypertrophic astrocytes. Increased enzyme activity was correlated significantly with assay results for HIV-1 DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The release of acid hydrolases associated with cerebral HIV-1 infection could lead to unopposed hydrolysis of matrix and surface proteins. These post-translational disturbances could contribute to white matter and synaptic injury in AIDS."

Nine men who began antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 18 months of seroconversion and had sustained plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for at least 6 months were enrolled. Median age was 38 years, median pre-ART HIV-1 RNA was 140,000 copies/ml and mean baseline CD4 count was 755/μl. Two DNA, followed by 2 MVA, inoculations were given 8 weeks apart. Eight subjects completed all vaccinations and TI. Clinical and laboratory adverse events were generally mild, with no serious or grade 4 events. Only reactogenicity events were considered related to study drug. No treatment emergent viral resistance was seen. The vaccinations did not reduce viral reservoirs and virus re-emerged in all participants during TI, with a median time to re-emergence of 4 weeks. Eight of 9 participants had CD8+ T cells that could be stimulated by vaccine-matched Gag peptides prior to vaccination. Vaccinations boosted these responses as well as eliciting previously undetected CD8+ responses. Elicited T cells did not display signs of exhaustion. During TI, temporal patterns of viral re-emergence and Gag-specific CD8+ T cell expansion suggested that vaccine-specific CD8+ T cells had been stimulated by re-emergent virus in only 2 of 8 participants. In these 2, transient decreases in viremia were associated with Gag selection in known CD8+ T cell epitopes. We hypothesize that escape mutations, already archived in the viral reservoir, plus a poor ability of CD8+ T cells to traffic to and control virus at sites of re-emergence, limited the therapeutic efficacy of the DNA/MVA vaccine."
2882,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The source and dynamics of persistent HIV-1 during long-term combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) are critical to understanding the barriers to curing HIV-1 infection. To address this issue, we isolated and genetically characterized HIV-1 DNA from naïve and memory T cells from peripheral blood and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) from eight patients after 4-12 y of suppressive cART. Our detailed analysis of these eight patients indicates that persistent HIV-1 in peripheral blood and GALT is found primarily in memory CD4(+) T cells [CD45RO(+)/CD27((+/-))]. The HIV-1 infection frequency of CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood and GALT was higher in patients who initiated treatment during chronic compared with acute/early infection, indicating that early initiation of therapy results in lower HIV-1 reservoir size in blood and gut. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an HIV-1 genetic change between RNA sequences isolated before initiation of cART and intracellular HIV-1 sequences from the T-cell subsets after 4-12 y of suppressive cART in four of the eight patients. However, evolutionary rate analyses estimated no greater than three nucleotide substitutions per gene region analyzed during all of the 4-12 y of suppressive therapy. We also identified a clearly replication-incompetent viral sequence in multiple memory T cells in one patient, strongly supporting asynchronous cell replication of a cell containing integrated HIV-1 DNA as the source. This study indicates that persistence of a remarkably stable population of infected memory cells will be the primary barrier to a cure, and, with little evidence of viral replication, this population could be maintained by homeostatic cell proliferation or other processes.

Restriction mapping of the recombinant clone, designated HIV-Zr6, revealed both common (as observed in other HIV isolates) and unique restriction sites. The DNA clone of HIV-Zr6, shown to give rise to infectious cytopathic virus after transfection of cultured lymphoid cells, was sequenced in several regions. The long terminal repeat (LTR), open reading frame 1 (ORF1), C-terminal envelope (env) gene domain, and ORF2 showed less than 6% difference in nucleotide sequence when compared to other HIV isolates including human T-lymphotropic virus-type III (HTLV-III) clone B10, lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1), and AIDS-associated retrovirus-2 (ARV-2). About 15% difference in nucleotide sequences was noted in the N-terminal env gene domain. Alignments of env gene sequences revealed conserved, moderately variable, and hypervariable stretches in the predicted amino acid sequences. This model provides a basis for assessing the significance of sequence variation on properties controlled by the viral Env glycoproteins such as cell tropism and immunogenicity."

CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
8760,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The serodiagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection primarily relies on the detection of antibodies, most of which are directed against the immunodominant regions (IDR) of HIV-1 structural proteins. Among these, the N-terminal region of gp41 contains cluster I (amino acids [aa] 580 to 623), comprising the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitope (AVERYLKDQQLL) and the cysteine loop (CSGKLIC), and cluster II (aa 646 to 682), comprising an ectodomain region (ELDKWA). To delineate the epitope diversity within clusters I and II and to determine whether the diversity affects serologic detection by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits, gp41 Env sequences from 247 seropositive persons infected with HIV-1 group M, subtypes A (n = 42), B (n = 62), B' (n = 13), C (n = 38), D (n = 41), E (n = 18), F (n = 27), and G (n = 6), and 6 HIV-1-infected but persistently seronegative (HIPS) persons were analyzed. While all IDR were highly conserved among both seropositive and HIPS persons, minor amino acid substitutions (<20% for any one residue, mostly conservative) were observed for all subtypes, except for B', in comparison with the consensus sequence for each subtype. Most importantly, none of the observed substitutions among the group M plasma specimens affected antibody detection, since all specimens (n = 152) tested positive with all five FDA-licensed EIA kits. Furthermore, all specimens reacted with a group M consensus gp41 peptide (WGIKQLQARVLAVERYLKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWNASW), and high degrees of cross-reactivity (>80%) were observed with an HIV-1 group N peptide, an HIV-1 group O peptide, and a peptide derived from the homologous region of gp41 from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzee (SIVcpz). Taken together, these data indicate that the minor substitutions observed within the IDR of gp41 of HIV-1 group M subtypes do not affect antibody recognition and that all HIV-1-seropositive specimens containing the observed substitutions react with the FDA-licensed EIA kits regardless of viral genotype and geographic origin."

In this study, before initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy, paired blood samples and rectal biopsies (RB) were obtained from 26 consecutive HIV-infected subjects. HIV-1 isolation and biological characterization, DNA, and HIV-1 RNA titration were assessed, as were in vitro tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-beta (IL-1beta) spontaneous production. The rate of HIV-1 isolation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and RBs was 75% and 58%, respectively. All RB-derived isolates were nonsyncytium inducing (NSI), independent of the phenotype of blood-derived isolates. Proviral DNA and detectable HIV-1 RNA levels were measured in 100% and 77% of RBs, respectively. A statistical correlation was observed between HIV-1 DNA and HIV-1 RNA levels in rectal mucosa (P = 0.0075), whereas no correlation was found between these levels in blood samples (P > 0.05). Antiretroviral treatment did not seem to influence HIV-1 detection in RBs. Higher levels of in vitro proinflammmatory cytokine production were found in the RBs of most infected patients when compared with healthy controls. Therefore, the rectal mucosa is an important HIV-1 reservoir that demonstrates a discordant viral evolution with respect to blood. Both the virus type and the mucosa pathway of immunoactive substances might have important implications for therapeutic decision-making and monitoring and could influence the bidirectional transmission of HIV-1 in mucosal surfaces."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."

This study aimed to evaluate the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of coagulation, serum level of fibrinogen and platelet count in HIV positive patients and compare it with negative healthy individuals. Through a case-control study, 114 HIV seropositive patients were compared with 114 seronegative samples in terms of hematological and other coagulation parameters. Mean age of study patients was 37.48 years. Intra venous drug abuse was the most common route of infection transmission with a prevalence of more than 50%. HIV route of transmission had a direct relationship with PTT abnormal levels (P&lt;0.0001). However, this relationship was not significant for PT values. Stages of HIV disease and administration of HAART did not reveal any significant relationship with PT and PTT. There was also a statistically significant correlation between CD4+&lt; 200 and PT in case group (P=0.008). On the other hands, in control group, CD4+ had a weak relationship with PTT (P=0.02) and an inverse correlation with serum fibrinogen (P=0.013).

Based on histopathological findings, he was diagnosed as having human herpes virus-8-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and was treated with four-weekly infusions of rituximab. Prior to receiving chemotherapy, we observed several suspected biomarkers of disease activity, positive correlations between plasma human herpes virus-8 viral load and the levels of plasma interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and soluble interleukin-2 receptor, and negative correlations between platelet count, albumin levels and especially serum sodium levels. We hypothesize that non-osmotic release of plasma antidiuretic hormone is a cause of hyponatraemia in human herpes virus-8-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and that relapsing and remitting hyponatraemia could be correlated with plasma human herpes virus-8 viral load.

All patients were followed for 24 months after IFN discontinuation and received a second liver biopsy. During the 6 months of treatment all patients had a progressive reduction of serum HBV-DNA levels, and at the end of therapy nine out of ten were HBV-DNA-negative and had normal ALT values. None of the untreated patients became persistently HBV-DNA-negative or showed significant variations of ALT levels. During the post-treatment follow-up, from 1 to 17 months after ly-IFN discontinuation, eight of the nine responders (89%) had recurrent or persistent reappearance of HBV-DNA in the serum and reactivation of the liver disease activity, with an ALT peak in four of them. On the post-trial liver biopsy seven of the eight relapsed patients showed persistence of HBcAg reactivity with no significant difference in the percentage of positive cells with respect to the pre-treatment liver specimen. Histological features improved in four treated patients, worsened in one untreated case and were unchanged in the remaining patients. These results indicate that ly-IFN shows a transient antiviral effect in the therapy of anti-HBe- and HBV-DNA-positive CHB. The 6-month treatment regimen employed in this study seems insufficient for eradicating the replicating virus from the liver cells in the majority of patients and consequently does not appear to prevent HBV reactivation after IFN discontinuation."

The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9459,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Both serologic and molecular tools are useful for the diagnosis, monitoring and therapeutic management of viral hepatitis associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Compared with the standard tests to detect viral antigens and the antibodies directed against them, real-time PCR techniques today make it possible to quantify viral DNA more sensitively and more precisely. They thus replace the techniques previously used in most virology laboratories. New markers, such as the HBV genotype or the amino-acid substitution profile associated with HBV resistance to nucleoside and nucleotide analogs (NRTIs), can also be characterized by techniques based on sequencing or reverse hybridization. There is not currently any consensus about the first-line treatment for chronic HBV infection. Patients with a wild-type virus (HBe antigen-positive), a moderate viral load, and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (from 2 to 5 times the upper limit of normal) are good candidates for treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha. Patients who are HBe antigen-positive and do not respond to this first-line treatment, as well as patients with chronic e-antigen-negative hepatitis B, are candidates for prolonged treatment, probably lifelong, by nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. Whatever the HBe serologic status and treatment, the efficacy of antiviral treatment is assessed by repeated measurements of viral load and serum alanine aminotransferase levels, in principle, every 12-24 months. In patients who are HBe antigen-positive, the efficacy of antiviral treatment is shown by the loss of HBe antigen, followed by the appearance of anti-HBe antibodies (HBe seroconversion), a reduction in viral load below 2x10(4)IU/mL and normalization of serum aminotransferase. In patients who are HBe antigen-negative or HBe antigen-positive but do not seroconvert after short-term treatment and who receive nucleoside or nucleotide analogs, the treatment objective is for HBV DNA to become undetectable by real-time PCR. Nonetheless, this objective is not always met, and it is recommended that viral replication be maintained at the lowest possible level for the longest possible time (ideally, lifelong). In all cases, when a virologic response to treatment is observed (significant reduction in viral load) and is followed by a relapse characterized by a viral load augmentation of at least 1 Log(10)IU/mL relative to the nadir, viral resistance to treatment must be suspected, after treatment adherence has been verified."

Clinical, epidemiological and immunovirological data including phylogeny based on the polymerase gene were collected. 65 males and 14 females were enrolled. The main transmission route was homosexual contact (60.8%). Patients were mostly infected with subtype B (73.4%) and CRF02_AG (21.5%) HIV-1 strains. An increase in the annual number of HIV seroconversions among new HIV diagnoses from 5% in 2005 to 11.2% in 2012 (P = 0.06) and of the proportion of CRF02_AG HIV strains among primary HIV infections in 2011-2012 as compared to 2005-2010 (P = 0.055) was observed.

To investigate the association between smoking and mortality among PLWHA during the HAART era (1996+), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,108 PLWHA enrolled in Seattle and King County's Adult and Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease Study. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality were obtained using Cox proportional hazards regression. Compared to never smokers, current smokers (aHR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.3) and individuals with an increased dose and/or duration of smoking were at greater risk of all-cause mortality. Although additional research is needed to evaluate the full effect of smoking on cause-specific mortality, smoking cessation programs should target PLWHA to further increase their life expectancy."

A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."

Logistic regression analysis (restricted to nonimmunized subjects) showed that male-male sexual activity raised the odds of HBV infection by a factor of 5.14 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-18. 23) relative to heterosexual activity; and that for every one point increase on the substance abuse risk scale the odds of infection increased 5% (95% CI: 0.99-1.10). The HBV infection rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive females is twice United States population-based rates; the rate in PACTG 220 HIV-positive males is nearly seven times higher. Past immunization efforts in this population appear to have been based on sexual activity volume without regard to injecting-drug use in sex partners."

Data were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses, using overall survival as end point. Patients received CHOP-like therapy as standard treatment. Until May 1999 incidence of all diagnosed cases of NHL was decreasing (1991-94: 14.2% versus 1995-5/99: 12.8%). Mainly, the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL clearly decreased whereas the incidence of high-grade B-cell NHL increased compared to all diagnosed cases of NHL (1983-86: 53.3% versus 1995-5/99: 78.6%). One-year survival probability of all screened patients with AIDS related NHL was 54%, while 5-year survival rate remained 5%. We found age <25 years, development of NHL in the years before 1990, IVDU, CD4 counts <150/microl, PCNSL as well as NHL as the AIDS index disease, to be highly significant independent predictors of poor survival, including increased hazard ratios. In the era of HAART incidence of NHL is decreasing, mainly the incidence of low-grade NHL and PCNSL. Overall survival of patients has been prolonged with HAART. This development is mainly due to improvement of antiretroviral therapy, rather than to any fundamental changes in the chemotherapeutic treatment of NHL. Therefore, new treatment approaches for AIDS-related NHL should focus on more efficient antiretroviral therapy in association with combination chemotherapy."

Clinically, HIV-2 patients have a higher CD4 cell count at the time of an AIDS diagnosis, and generally have longer survival after development of symptoms. The mortality after an AIDS diagnosis has been reported to be more influenced by CD4 cell count than HIV type. Previous studies have shown significant variations in cytopathic effects following in vitro infection with primary isolates of HIV-1 or HIV-2 subtypes; however, the relative contributions of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection leading to cell death remain unclear. Using a human cell line, Jurkat, we examined differences in key molecules involved in apoptotic signaling pathways during infection with either HIV-1 or HIV-2. HIV-1 infection generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased the expression of a larger number of molecules involved in cell signaling such as p47, p38alpha, JNK, c-Yes, total PKC, and decreased the expression of molecules such as p38beta, ERK1/2, and XIAP relative to HIV-2 infection. HIV-1 induced a higher degree of cell death through stronger activation of both apoptotic pathways. HIV-1 infection downregulated both Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expressions at later time points postinfection, while HIV-2 infection dramatically upregulated both Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expression. We also found that the expression of Bcl-X(L) or FLIP resulted in significant inhibition of HIV replication in Jurkat cells. These findings suggest that HIV-1 infection with high levels of cytotoxicity results in a higher level of cell death through apoptosis during a short time postinfection. The longer period of infection observed with HIV-2 with a lower degree of cytotoxicity was accompanied by increased Bcl-X(L) and FLIP expression. High protein levels of Bcl-X(L) or FLIP inhibit HIV replication and may be one explanation for the clinical observation that HIV-2 infected patients generally tend to be long-term nonprogressors with high CD4 lymphocyte counts compared with HIV-1 infected persons."

When assessed in the two-day multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay, involving a single cycle of HIV-1 replication, all protease inhibitors failed to block infection of HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells by HIV-1, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (AZT and ddI) completely blocked the infection. Moreover, when HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis was examined by polymerase chain reaction in HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells exposed to HIV-1 and cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors, a significant amount of proviral DNA was detected, while no proviral DNA synthesis was detected when the cells were cultured in the presence of RT inhibitors. Protease inhibitors also failed to block chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in HLCD4-CAT cells exposed to HIV-1, while RT inhibitors completely suppressed CAT expression. These results strongly suggest, contrary to a previous report by Nagy et al. (1994), that HIV-1 protease does not play a major role in the early stages of infection."
4649,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health problem worldwide. The mechanism of susceptibility to chronic persistent HBV infection is not well clarified, while the outcome of HBV infection mainly depends on the host immune response. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule is an integral component of the immune response on which majority of host genetic studies have concentrated. Many different HLA class II alleles have been demonstrated to play roles in HBV infection. In this study, the association between HBV infection and HLA-DRB1 alleles in Han individuals in northwestern China was studied for the first time. Two hundred and fifty Shaanxi Han individuals were categorized into three different groups: the HBV-infected patient group (n = 108), the spontaneously cleared control group (n = 108) and the unexposed group (n = 34). DRB1*04, DRB1*09, DRB1*12 and DRB1*15 were the most common genotypes in all the groups. The allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*03 [10.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 3.7% of spontaneously cleared controls, odds ratios (OR) = 3.10, Pc = 0.008, P < 0.05] and HLA-DRB1*07 (17.6% of HBV-infected patients vs 9.3% of spontaneously cleared controls, Pc = 0.016, OR = 2.09, P < 0.05) were markedly higher in the HBV-infected group. But the allele frequencies of HLA-DRB1*15 (6.9% of HBV-infected patients vs 13.4% of spontaneously cleared controls Pc = 0.039, OR = 0.48, P < 0.05) were obviously lower than that of the spontaneously cleared controls. The above data indicate that HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*07 are related to susceptibility to chronic HBV infection, and DRB1*15 is negatively related to persistence to chronic HBV infection among people in northwestern China. Similar results were got for DRB1*03 and 15 alleles between the HBV-infected patients (n = 108) and 46 HBV seronegative spouses of the HBV patients, who were high-risk group for HBV infection. The above results suggest that host HLA class II gene is an important factor in determination of the outcome of HBV infection."

We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."

For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."

Previous studies have demonstrated that lamivudine was effective for HBV flare-up during cytotoxic chemotherapy. We aimed to monitor the HBV status of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with preemptive lamivudine over time. Six breast cancer patients carrying hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were monitored during chemotherapy, five in the adjuvant setting and one with metastatic disease. Preemptive lamivudine was given throughout the chemotherapy course. HBsAg, HBV envelope antigen (HBeAg), anti-HBV envelope antibody (HBe Ab), serial serum alanine transaminase (ALT), quantitative HBV viral DNA analysis, and HBV DNA precore promoter and precore sequence were monitored. One patient carried wild type and the other five precore mutant strain of HBV by examination of HBV sequence in precore promoter and precore region. No evident HBV reactivation developed, and all patients tolerated lamivudine well. During the 6-to-8-month follow-up after cessation of cytotoxic therapy and withdrawal of lamivudine, serum ALT remained unchanged, although an increase of HBV DNA levels in four patients was found. No emergence of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) lamivudine-selective resistant strain was observed in the six patients. Preemptive use of lamivudine can effectively prevent reactivation of HBV in breast cancer patients receiving postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Lamivudine can be discontinued safely without emergence of lamivudine-resistant HBV strain or rebound HBV flare-up. The candidate for the use of preemptive lamivudine in HBV carriers who need short-term chemotherapy remained to be investigated"

We have previously demonstrated the presence of VRC01-resistant strains in an HIV-1 infected patient during antiretroviral therapy. Here, we report follow-up studies of two subsequent samples from the same patient. With genetic and phenotypic analysis of over 70 full-length molecular clones of the HIV-1 envelope, we show that VRC01-resistant HIV-1 continued to exist and change in its proportion of the infecting virus during treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy. Consistent with our previous observation, the resistant phenotype was associated with a single asparagine residue at position 460 (N460), a potential N-linked glycosylation site in the V5 region. The persistence and continuing evolution of VRC01-resistant HIV-1 in vivo presents a great challenge to our future preventative and therapeutic interventions based on VRC01. "
5770,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."

A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."
6689,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."

One complication observed in approximately 12% of HIV-infected patients is a presumed neuroretinal disorder (NRD), manifested as decreased contrast sensitivity and associated with vague subjective complaints of hazy vision. Pathologically, patients with AIDS even without ocular opportunistic infections have loss of optic nerve axons, suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. We explored whether variation in mitochondrial DNA was associated with time to NRD in HIV-infected patients in the Longitudinal Study of Ocular Complications of AIDS cohort. Within the Western European, or ""N"", mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup, haplogroup J, was associated with 80% decrease in the risk of progression to NRD during the study (hazard ratio = 0.20, P = 0.039) and suggested an independent association with protection against NRD in a cross-section of all patients taken at enrollment (1.5% vs. 8.9% in patients with vs. without haplogroup J, respectively, P = 0.05). These data suggest that mitochondrial genotype may influence propensity to develop HIV-associated NRD in patients with AIDS."

However, a major problem is the presence of side effects that require modification or withdrawal of drug therapy in 15-20% of cases. This could potentially influence the lack of sustained viral response in 50% of the cases. Side effects are common, even with pegylated interferon. This study aimed to assess the incidence and severity of infections based on the development of neutropenia associated with combined therapy with pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin in 209 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. All patients were administered pegylated interferon-alpha2a (180 microg/week) plus ribavirin (800 mg/day for 24 weeks in cases of nongenotype 1, or 1000-1200 mg/day for 48 weeks for genotype 1, according to whether patients weighed more or less than 75 kg). Patients with preexisting neutropenia of any cause or cirrhosis were excluded. Neutropenia was defined as a neutrophil count (NC) of <1500 cells/microl. Neutropenia was classified into three levels during treatment: 750<or=NC<1500 (level 1), 500<or=750 (level 2), and NC<500 cells/microl (level 3). Of the 209 patients, 114 did not develop neutropenia (mean 2100+/-804 cells/microl), while 95 had an NC<1500 cells/microl (mean 1100+/-250 cells/microl). It was found that patients who developed neutropenia during treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection with a combined therapy based on pegylated interferon-alpha2a plus ribavirin did not show a higher infection rate or increased severity of the disease."

To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."

All chronic HBsAg carriers with delta superinfection had chronic active hepatitis or active liver cirrhosis. They were predominantly anti-HBe (+) in the serum. The mean age and the mean values of serum transaminase did not differ in delta antigen positive and negative patients with chronic liver diseases. A history of parenteral manipulations directly before the hepatitis was present in patients with delta antigen positive fulminant hepatitis.

This paper reviews data on the prevalence and incidence of HCV, and the methods used to generate such information, among injecting drug users (IDUs), in Scotland. The prevalence estimate for HCV among IDUs in Scotland as a whole (44% in 2000), is comparable with those observed in many European countries. Incidence rates ranged from 11.9 to 28.4/100 person-years. The data have shaped policy to prevent infection among IDUs and have informed predictions of the number of HCV-infected IDUs who will likely progress to, and require treatment and care for, severe HCV-related liver disease. Although harm reduction interventions, in particular needle and syringe exchanges and methadone maintenance therapy, reduced the transmission of HCV among IDUs during the early to mid-1990s, incidence in many parts of the country remains high. The prevention of HCV among IDUs continues to be one of Scotland's major public health challenges."

Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between selenium, copper, and zinc in comparison with transaminase level in chronic HBV patients. Serum samples of the HBV infected patients were obtained from Tooba medical center, Sari, Iran. Sixty patients were enrolled in this study (36 men and 24 women), mean age: 39.6 ± 12.2 years. The concentration of zinc, selenium, copper and transaminases were determined using an autoanalyzer system. Concentrations of selenium (0.273 ± 0.056 μg/dl) and zinc (2.1 ± 0.037) was elevated in patients with low transaminase levels as were significantly different in comparison with patients with high transaminase level (P<0.05). Serum copper concentration was similar in two groups of patients. Elevated levels of transaminase concentrations were independently associated with low zinc and selenium concentrations in chronic HBV patients. It is concluded that serum zinc and selenium levels are associated with less hepatic damage in chronic HBV patients and might have a protective role during liver injury."

Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."

Among those factors, the importance of pre-BMT viral hepatitis markers in BMT donors and recipients remains unsettled. In the present study, we have determined the effect of prior donor and recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) exposure on the incidence of those viral infections after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The study included 63 patients presented to the BMT unit; 28 of them underwent transplantation and 35 were not transplanted. All serum markers of CMV, HBV, and HCV infections were monitored using ELISA technique, as well as PCR-DNA for CMV, HBV and HCV RT-PCR techniques for HCV. The incidence of active CMV and HCV was 11/28 (39%) and 6/28 (21%) in post-BMT recipients compared to 2/35 (6%) and 2/35 (6%) in the 35 untransplanted patients (P=0.00003 and P=0.05). Whereas active HBV infection was non significantly (P=0.13) higher 3/28 (11%) in the BMT patients in comparison to 1/35 (3%) in untransplanted patients. Ten out of the 19 (53%) of the CMV-seropositive recipients developed CMV reactivation compared to 1/9 (11%) of the CMV-seronegative recipients who developed CMV seroconversion. In addition, 3/8 (38%) of the HBV-seropositive recipients developed HBV reactivation in comparison to 0/20 of the HBV-seronegative recipients. Moreover, 5/13 (39%) of the HCV-seropositive recipients developed HCV reactivation in comparison to 1/16 (6%) of the HCV-seronegative recipients who developed HCV seroconversion. In conclusion, previous exposure to CMV, HBV, and HCV infections in the recipients of BMT patients were found to influence the risk of developing those viral infections."

Despite the prevalence of HBV infection in Egypt, few studies have focused on sub-genotyping of the virus. Moreover, no studies are available regarding the mutational analysis of the preS1/preS2 region of the viral genome, or its impact on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Egypt. In this study, we have analyzed the sub-genotypes and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV present in HBV-infected patients, from Mansoura city (located in the center of Nile Delta region of Egypt), via partial sequencing of this specific region. Moreover, we have investigated the impact of these mutations on HCC development by measuring serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) level and abdominal ultrasound examination of the HBV-infected patients. According to our results, all samples were genotype D in which sub-genotype D1 was predominant. In addition, the results revealed mutations in the preS1/preS2 region, which could result in either immature preS1 protein or completely inhibit the translation of the preS2 protein. However, there was no incidence of HCC development in patients infected with mutated HBV in the preS1/preS2 region. In summary, for the first time our work has proved the predominance of sub-genotype D1 among HBV-infected Egyptian patients in Mansoura city, Nile Delta region, Egypt, and incidence of mutations in the preS1/preS2 region of HBV genome. This current study opens up research opportunities to discuss the impact of HBV mutations on the development of HCC in Egypt."

Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."

A total of 305 HIV-1-infected patients who received 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (vaccinees) and 203 patients who did not (non-vaccinees) were prospectively observed between 1 June 2000 and 31 October 2002. Changes of CD4+ and plasma viral load (PVL) from baseline to week 4 of vaccination were assessed in 31 randomly selected vaccinees. The incidence of pneumococcal disease and bacteremia of vaccinees was 2.1 per 1000 patient-years (PY) (95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-2.5 per 1000 PY) over the median observation of 641 days (range, 37-832 days) following vaccination while that of non-vaccinee was 21.8 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 20.1-23.7 per 1000 PY) and 7.3 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 7.0-7.6 per 1000 PY), respectively, over the observation of 500 days (range, 32-851 days), with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for developing pneumococcal disease of 0.085 (95% CI, 0.010-0.735) and for bacteremia of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.018-2.561). The median CD4+ count increased by 45 x 10(6) l(-1) (P = 0.01) and median PVL change was 0 log(10) copies/ml (range of decrease, -0.74 to 2.47 log(10) copies/ml) after 1 month of pneumococcal vaccination among the subgroup of 31 vaccinees receiving HAART. The median CD4+ count increase from baseline to the end of study was 149 x 10(6) l(-1) for vaccinees and 107 x 10(6) l(-1) for non-vaccinees (P = 0.21). The AOR of developing all-cause community-acquired pneumonia and new AIDS-defining opportunistic illnesses (OI) of vaccinees as compared to non-vaccinees was 1.876 (95% CI, 0.785-4.485) and 0.567 (95% CI, 0.217-1.484), respectively. Death rate of vaccinees and non-vaccinees was 17.7 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 16.5-18.9 per 1000 PY) and 80.5 per 1000 PY (95% CI, 77.1-83.9 per 1000 PY), respectively. Adjusted hazard ratio for death of vaccinees as compared with non-vaccinees was 0.733 (95% CI, 0.236-2.274). Our data suggested that vaccination with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and receipt of HAART were associated with reduced risks for pneumococcal disease among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART. Vaccination did not increase the risks of all-cause community-acquired pneumonia, HIV progression, and mortality. Vaccination did not increase PVL or decrease CD4+ among HIV-1-infected patients receiving HAART."

Protective factors described so far such as the CCR5delta32 deletion, protective HLA alleles, or defective viruses fail to fully explain the partial protection phenotype. The existence of additional host resistance mechanisms in LTNP patients was investigated here using a whole human genome microarray study comparing gene expression profiles of unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from LTNP patients, HIV-1 infected patients under antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ T cell levels above 500/mm(3) (ST), as well as healthy individuals. Genes that were up- or downregulated exclusively in LTNP, ST or in both groups in comparison to controls were identified and classified in functional categories using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. ST and LTNP patient groups revealed distinct genetic profiles, regarding gene number in each category and up- or downregulation of specific genes, which could have a bearing on the outcome of each group. We selected some relevant genes to validate the differential expression using quantitative real-time qRT-PCR. Among others, we found several genes related to the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our results identify new possible host genes and molecules that could be involved in the mechanisms leading to the slower progression to AIDS and sustained CD4+ T cell counts that is peculiar to LTNP patients.

A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."

A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."
6416,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected CD8 lymphocytes have been reported in vivo, but the mechanism of infection remains unclear. Experiments using the thy/hu mouse model support export of intrathymically infected CD8 precursors, while recent in vitro data suggest that mature CD8 lymphocytes upregulate CD4 upon activation (generating a CD8bright CD4dim phenotype) and are susceptible to HIV infection. To determine whether these mechanisms operate in vivo and to assess their relative importance in the generation of circulating HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes, we quantified HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA in CD8+ CD4- and CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected individuals by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. HIV infection of CD8 lymphocytes was demonstrated in 17 of 19 subjects, with a significant inverse relationship between level of infection and CD4 lymphocyte count (R = -0.73; P < 0.001). The level of HIV infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes was significantly higher (median, 1,730 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells; n = 9) than that of CD8+ CD4- lymphocytes (undetectable in seven of nine individuals; P < 0.01) and approached that of CD4 lymphocytes from the same individuals (median, 3,660 HIV LTR copies/10(6) cells). CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes represented 0.8 to 3.3% of total CD8 lymphocytes and were most prevalent in the memory subset. Thus, HIV-infected CD8 lymphocytes commonly circulate in HIV-infected individuals and are generated through infection of activated CD8 lymphocytes rather than through export of intrathymically infected precursors. The high level of infection of CD8bright CD4dim lymphocytes could have a direct role in the decline in CD8 lymphocyte function that accompanies HIV disease progression."
8191,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latently infected cells, NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a critical role in the transcriptional induction of the HIV-1 promoter. The trans-activating ability of NF-kappaB can be modified by another nuclear factor C/EBPbeta that can physically bind to NF-kappaB and regulate its activity. Because the HIV-1 promoter also contains a C/EBPbeta site adjacent to the NF-kappaB site, the present study examined cooperative functional in vivo interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta, and the impact of Tat in this event. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of p65 along with Tat increases p65 binding to HIV-1 LTR, and that this increase correlates with enhanced HIV-1 promoter activity. Further, co-expression of C/EBPbeta and Tat leads to a decrease in p65 binding, which allows C/EBPbeta to bind more efficiently to the LTR. Inhibition of p65 expression by siRNA significantly decreases C/EBPbeta-binding and LTR expression. Using ChIP assay, we confirmed the existence of an interchange between p65 and C/EBPbeta and their abilities to bind to the LTR in vivo. These observations demonstrate that a delicate balance of interaction between p65, C/EBPbeta, and Tat can dictate the level of HIV-1 LTR transcription."

The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."

Ideally, expression of the anti-HIV-1 gene constructs should be induced during early stages of infection to combat high turnover of the replicating virus. In this study, we investigated the activity of two promoters, HIV-1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1-LTR) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR fused with the transactivation response element (TAR) from the HIV-1-LTR (ie RSV-TAR) in presence of Tat, the major HIV-1 transcriptional transactivator and an early gene product in HIV-1 infection. Comparative expression from both of these plasmids was analyzed by measuring expression of a reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), after transfection of the promoter-CAT constructs and a Tat-expressing plasmid into CEM T lymphocytic cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The HIV-1-LTR could be transactivated by Tat in both unstimulated and stimulated cells. Although the RSV-TAR had a relatively high basal level of expression, Tat transactivation of this chimeric promoter occurred only in unstimulated cells. These results suggest that the HIV-1-LTR may be a better promoter for therapeutic gene expression in anti-HIV-1 intracellular immunization approaches."

All subjects were HIV-infected men cared for at the San Francisco Veterans' Affairs Medical Center between January 1988 and November 1991. Survival was measured from the date on which a patient was first known to have a CD4 count < or = 100/mm3 until death or censoring. Factors potentially associated with survival were examined initially using the product limit (Kaplan-Meier) method; a multivariate model of survival was constructed using a proportional hazards (Cox) regression. Four variables were identified as independently associated with survival (p < 0.05) in the Cox proportional hazards model: CD4 count, hematocrit, azidothymidine use, and clinical stage (prior history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome vs. no prior history). All 16 possible combinations of these four (dichotomized) variables were examined; eight different patterns of survival were detected. Identification of survival patterns that can be described by data obtained as part of routine clinical care has implications for patient care, the design of clinical trials, the study of mechanisms of progression of HIV-related immunosuppression, and planning of health care resource needs for populations of patients with very low CD4 counts."

To delineate the genetic determinants underlying specific biological characteristics such as rate of replication and cellular tropism, generation of hybrid HIV using viruses which exhibit distinct biological feature is essential. We have used three different infectious HIV proviral DNAs, designated pZ6, pHXB2 and pARV, derived from HIVZr6, HIVHTLV-IIIB and HIVSF-2 strains, respectively, to construct hybrid HIV. Proviral DNAs differed in their ability to direct the synthesis of viral particles upon transfection into cells and the viruses derived from the molecular clones exhibited different cellular tropism. Three different methods were utilized to generate hybrid HIV, including construction of hybrid proviral DNA using molecular techniques, intracellular ligation of viral DNA fragments and the homologous recombination approach. The chimeric proviral DNAs with exchanges involving only the long terminal repeat (LTR) region indicated that LTR does not exert influence on the overall level of virus production despite extensive differences in the U3 region of the LTR. Regarding the cellular tropism of HIV, the virus derived from pHXB2 productively infected CEMx174 cells. On the other hand, pARV-derived virus did not show productive infection of CEMx174 cells. The hybrid HIV containing the 3'-end of the genome from pARV and the 5'-end of the genome from pHXB2 was effective in infecting CEMx174 cells. However, the converse hybrid containing the 5'-pARV and the 3'-pHXB2 was not effective in infecting CEMx174 cells. These results suggest that differences in the genes outside of env and nef may play a role in the ability of virus to infect a certain cell type."

Three months after initiation of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), the patient had disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis and started anti-leishmanial therapy. The patient's leishmaniasis manifestations during HAART ranged form an anergic response (46 CD4+ T cells/microL) to a disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (112 CD4+ T cells/microL). Eight weeks later (168 CD4+ T cells/microL, skin biopsy specimens showed inflammatory infiltrates with no detectable amastigotes. The patient then became comatose. Prednisone therapy (60 mg/day) was initiated with a significant improvement within 48 hours. Three months later (CD4+ T cell count = 184 cell/microL), localized, classic, cutaneous leishmaniasis developed in the patient and anti-leishmanial treatment was re-introduced. On that occasion, frequency of T regulatory cells was 1.82% of all CD4+ cells. Our data suggest a pivotal role for CD4+ T cells in the onset of IRIS and lesion ulceration and their association with a low frequency of T regulatory cells."

After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."

Genomic differences explain why commercial tests used to quantify HIV-1 group M plasma load are unsuitable for HIV-1 group O. This lack of a quantitative tool hinders the clinical management of HIV-O-infected patients. We have therefore developed a real-time PCR assay, based on LightCycler technology, to quantify HIV-1 group O RNA in plasma. The primers were selected in the LTR 3' region. Forty-eight plasma samples containing strains belonging to the different HIV-1 type O clades (O:A, O:B and O:C) were tested. RNA was quantifiable in 40 of these samples. RNA was always detected in samples from untreated patients, except for one patient infected by a highly divergent strain. The kinetics of plasma viral load were also examined in seven patients for whom clinical and immunologic follow-up data were available. HIV-1 group O plasma load was high in the absence of treatment and correlated negatively with the CD4 cell count. Serial samples obtained during treatment allowed us to compare viral load changes with immunologic outcome. Despite the high initial cost of acquiring the required cycling device, the per-sample cost of this real-time quantitative PCR assay for HIV-1 group O is low, making it suitable for use in endemic zones."

Although secondary data based on official mortality statistics indicate a sharp decrease in AIDS mortality, few if any studies tried to estimate the prognosis for patients with HIV who have been followed from the beginning of the HAART era. An observational study, with retrospective and prospective components, was done in 233 adult HIV-1-infected subjects who were recruited in the last 10 years at the outpatient sector of the Secondary Immunodeficiencies Clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Hospital das Clinicas da FMUSP, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The definition of AIDS followed the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 1987. One hundred sixty patients were asymptomatic, 46 had AIDS, 24 had AIDS-related complex, and 3 presented with acute infection at study entry. Twenty-nine (18%) of the asymptomatic subjects developed AIDS during follow-up, with 5 (3%) deaths. Among the 46 AIDS cases at entry, 7 (17%) died during follow-up. Thus, a total of 12 people (5.2%) died of AIDS in this cohort over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years and 24 people were lost to follow-up (10.3%). Ninety percent of the survivors were on combined therapy (82% with 3 or more drugs, and 8% with 2 drugs), while 10% were not taking antiretrovirals. People with AIDS at entry were 5 times more likely to die during this period compared to patients who were asymptomatic at entry (p = 0.006). Women showed better outcomes than men, reflecting differences in CD4+ T-cell counts at study entry. All but 1 patient progressed to AIDS during the pre-HAART era (before 1996). In spite of its recent decline, mortality from AIDS-related conditions remains an important public health issue."

Epitope mapping of the region between amino acid residues 1679 and 1768 in the HCV polyprotein revealed two major antigenic regions (1961 to 1708 and 1710 to 1728) that were recognized by antibody elicited upon natural infection of HCV. The antigenic regions were highly variable between variants of HCV, with only 50 to 60% amino acid sequence similarity between types 1, 2, and 3. Although limited serological cross-reactivity between HCV types was detected between peptides, particularly in the first antigenic region of NS-4, type-specific reactivity formed the principal component of the natural humoral immune response to NS-4. Type-specific antibody to particular HCV types was detected in 89% of the samples from anti-HCV-positive blood donors and correlated almost exactly with genotypic analysis of HCV sequences amplified from the samples by polymerase chain reaction. Whereas almost all blood donors appeared to be infected with a single virus type (97%), a higher proportion of samples (40%) from hemophiliacs infected from transfusion of non-heat-inactivated clotting factor contained antibody to two or even all three HCV types, providing evidence that long-term exposure may lead to multiple infection with different variants of HCV."

To search for possible sources of HIV in saliva, and using the polymerase chain-reaction technique, we sought the presence and shedding patterns of proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid in a group of patients previously determined as HIV-1-seropositive. Periodontal status at the collection sites was monitored by several clinical parameters, including Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing depth, and clinical attachment loss. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected by means of paper points. Proviral HIV-1 DNA was detected in the gingival fluid of 17 out of 35 HIV-1-infected patients. Its detection correlated significantly with higher plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.03) and not with peripheral blood CD4+ cell count, the presence of blood in gingival fluid, or oral lesions. There was a significant correlation between clinical attachment loss at the sites of fluid collection and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.002), and borderline correlation between the latter and probing depth (p = 0.54) in the group of patients harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid. The results of our study suggest that mononuclear cells present in gingival crevicular fluid and harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA could represent a potential source of HIV-1 in the presence or absence of local bleeding, especially in persons with advanced HIV infection and increased loss of clinical attachment."

This study compares HIV-1 and HIV-2 in regard to the percentages of interleukin (IL)-2-, interferon (IFN)-gamma-, and IL-4-producing cells at the single-cell level, as determined by flow cytometry. At a given degree of CD4 T cell depletion, the frequency of T cells able to produce IL-2 is better preserved in HIV-2 than in HIV-1 infection, particularly within the CD4 T cell subset. As described for HIV-1 immunodeficiency, HIV-2-positive patients exhibit a marked expansion of terminally differentiated effector CD8 T cells (CD28(-)CD27(-)IFN-gamma(+)). However, the proportion of CD8 T cells able to simultaneously produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma is higher in HIV-2 disease. Considering the central role of IL-2 as a lymphocyte proliferative and survival factor, these findings provide a possible immunologic basis for the distinct course of HIV-2 immunodeficiency."

We have analyzed the association of sequence variation at the p7/p1 and p1/p6 CS in conjunction with amprenavir (APV)-specific protease mutations following PI combination therapy with APV. Querying a central resistance data repository resulted in the detection of significant associations (P < 0.001) between the presence of APV protease signature mutations and Gag L449F (p1/p6 LP1'F) and P453L (p1/p6 PP5'L) CS changes. In population-based sequence analyses the I50V mutant was invariably linked to either L449F or P453L. Clonal analysis revealed that both CS mutations were never present in the same genome. Sequential plasma samples from one patient revealed a transition from I50V M46L P453L viruses at early time points to I50V M46I L449F viruses in later samples. Various combinations of the protease and Gag mutations were introduced into the HXB2 laboratory strain of HIV-1. In both single- and multiple-cycle assay systems and in the context of I50V, the L449F and P453L changes consistently increased the 50% inhibitory concentration of APV, while the CS changes alone had no measurable effect on inhibitor sensitivity. The decreased in vitro fitness of the I50V mutant was only partially improved by addition of either CS change (I50V M46I L449F mutant replicative capacity approximately 16% of that of wild-type virus). Western blot analysis of Pr55 Gag precursor cleavage products from infected-cell cultures indicated accumulation of uncleaved Gag p1-p6 in all I50V viruses without coexisting CS changes. Purified I50V protease catalyzed cleavage of decapeptides incorporating the L449F or P453L change 10-fold and 22-fold more efficiently than cleavage of the wild-type substrate, respectively. HIV-1 protease CS changes are selected during PI therapy and can have effects on both viral fitness and phenotypic resistance to PIs."

HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."

It has recently been shown that human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and its ligand alpha(1) proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)PI; alpha(1)antitrypsin) act as HIV fusion cofactors. The present study shows that decreased HIV infectivity is significantly correlated with decreased cell surface density of HLE but not with decreased CD4 nor chemokine receptors. In vitro HIV infectivity outcome in this study was predicted by the surface density of HLE on mononuclear phagocytes but not on lymphocytes. The set point HLE surface density was in part determined by alpha(1)PI. Decreased circulating alpha(1)PI was correlated with increased cell surface HLE and with increased HIV infectivity. The correlation of HIV infectivity outcome with surface HLE and circulating alpha(1)PI supports the utility of these HIV cofactors in diagnostic analysis and therapeutic intervention."

We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."

Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."

Both abdominal and pleural cavities were involved; no solid tumor masses were found and bone marrow investigations were normal. The ascites and pleural effusion contained numerous pleomorphic lymphoid cells. Immunophenotyping was positive for CD138. Chromosome study showed complex cytogenetics. The genomic human herpesvirus-8 was detected in the lymphoma cells. It is postulated that the immunosuppressed state in this patient may have been caused by cirrhosis. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy of CHOP and Picibanil (OK-432) intraperitoneal administration. However, no durable remission was achieved.

Because disclosure to family members is imperative to ensure their support, identifying tools or resources that can minimize the possible risks and maximize the potential benefits of disclosure should be useful in improving the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. Where health systems require strengthening, engaging the community in HIV/AIDS care could potentially create an environment that encourages disclosure to family members. This study investigated the impact of community support initiatives (community health workers and treatment support groups), patient characteristics (age, gender, and education), and time since first diagnosis on the disclosure of serostatus to family members by a sample of 268 public-sector antiretroviral treatment patients in a province of South Africa between August 2004 and July 2007. Whereas gender, age, and education only weakly influenced disclosure, there was a strong and stable positive association between community support and disclosure to family members. The immediate and long-term impact of community support on the disclosure by seropositive patients to family members indicates that initiatives such as community health workers and HIV support groups run by people living with HIV/AIDS should be strengthened, especially for those patients who cannot disclose their status to immediate family and close friends."

These highly efficacious, well-tolerated, all-oral HCV regimens allow cure of HCV in over 95% of HCV-monoinfected as well as HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with short treatment durations of 8-12 weeks. Areas covered: This review will address recent developments of DAA-therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in clinical trials and real life cohorts and evaluate remaining challenges, particularly resistance, drug-drug interactions, acute HCV infection and liver transplantation focusing on HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Expert opinion: Indeed, all available data have shown that HIV/HCV-coinfection has no impact on HCV-treatment outcome. Management, indication of therapy and follow-up of HCV-infection are now the same for both patient populations. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients however, require careful evaluation of potential drug-drug-interactions between HCV drugs and HIV antiretroviral therapy, medication for substance abuse and other comedications. The few remaining gaps in DAA-therapy in particular treatment of cirrhotic treatment-experienced genotype 3 infections, decompensated cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease and patients with prior DAA treatment failure have mostly been overcome by the development of new HCV agents recently licensed. Clearly, the biggest challenge globally remains the access to treatment and the inclusion of all patient populations affected in particular people who inject drugs (PWID)."

This has led to a demand for affordable HIV-1 drug resistance assays, since treatment failure due to development of drug resistance is common. This study developed and evaluated an affordable ""in-house"" genotyping assay to monitor HIV-1 drug resistance in Africa, particularly South Africa. An ""in-house"" assay using automated RNA extraction, and subtype C specific PCR and sequencing primers was developed and successfully evaluated 396 patient samples (viral load ranges 1000-1.6 million RNA copies/ml). The ""in-house"" assay was validated by comparing sequence data and drug resistance profiles from 90 patient and 10 external quality control samples to data from the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping kit. The ""in-house"" assay was more efficient, amplifying all 100 samples, compared to 91 samples using Viroseq. The ""in house"" sequences were 99.2% homologous to the ViroSeq sequences, and identical drug resistance mutation profiles were observed in 96 samples. Furthermore, the ""in-house"" assay genotyped 260 of 295 samples from seven African sites, where 47% were non-subtype C. Overall, the newly validated ""in-house"" drug resistance assay is suited for use in Africa as it overcomes the obstacle of subtype diversity."

Compared with the controls, all three groups of patients were more likely to be seropositive for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and the haemophiliacs and cancer patients (but not the relatively young drug users) were more likely to be seropositive for hepatitis B virus (HBV). All the haemophiliacs and cancer patients found to be carrying the surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) and/or to be seropositive for anti-HCV had given the same result when tested before the screening of blood and blood products for HBsAg and anti-HCV became routine practice in Lebanon (a decade before the present study). The four intravenous drug users (IVDU) found seropositive for HBV (two cases) or anti-HCV (two cases) had seroconverted in the 2 years prior to the present study. In addition to highlighting the problem of HCV infection among IVDU, the present results emphasise the need for the careful screening of donated blood for all blood-borne viruses, and for the exclusive use of disposable equipment in the management of cancer patients. The anti-HBV vaccination of IVDU is recommended but only the results of further clinical evaluation will show whether the similar vaccination of patients on cycled cancer chemotherapy is of value. Although none of the patients or controls was found positive for anti-HIV-1, anti-HIV-2 or anti-HTLV-I, the routine screening of blood and blood products for these viruses (particularly for HIV) should remain mandatory."

Despite intensive control measurements, the incidences of chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections in our country are estimated as 5-7% and 3%, respectively. There are accumulating data of especially autoimmune mediated extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis B and C virus infections, such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Behçet's Disease (BD), hypo- or hyper-thyroiditis and autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was the retrospective evaluation of 400 chronic B hepatitis (CBH) and 35 C hepatitis (CCH) patients by means of the presence of extrahepatic manifestations. As a result, the positivity rates of extrahepatic manifestations detected in CBH and CCH patients were as follows respectively; 1.5% and 8.5% for DM, 1.5% and 5.7% for hypothyroiditis, 0.75% and 2.8% for hyperthyroiditis, 2% and 20% for nodular goitre, 0.25% and 5.7% for BD, 1% and 0% for systemic lupus, 1% and 5.7% for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and 22% and 11.4% for iron deficiency anemia. DM, thyroid diseases and RA were the most common extrahepatic manifestations detected in both of the patient groups, while the rates of DM, BD and nodular goitre were found higher in CCH patients than CBH patients (p < 0.05). As a result, the extrahepatic manifestations should be carefully followed in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C infections, for an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."

In addition to hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccination, oral antiviral therapies in highly viremic mothers can further decrease MTCT of HBV. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the evidence on the efficacy and maternal and fetal safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy. A protocol was developed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guideline writing committee. We searched multiple databases for controlled studies that enrolled pregnant women with chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy. Outcomes of interest were reduction of MTCT and adverse outcomes to mothers and newborns. Study selection and data extraction were done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 26 studies that enrolled 3622 pregnant women. Antiviral therapy reduced MTCT, as defined by infant hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.4) or infant HBV DNA seropositivity (risk ratio = 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.5) at 6-12 months. No significant differences were found in the congenital malformation rate, prematurity rate, and Apgar scores. Compared to control, lamivudine or telbivudine improved maternal HBV DNA suppression at delivery and during 4-8 weeks' postpartum follow-up. Tenofovir showed improvement in HBV DNA suppression at delivery. No significant differences were found in postpartum hemorrhage, cesarean section, and elevated creatinine kinase rates."

In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."

Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."

In the present study, the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the spontaneous apoptosis of distinct T cell subsets were investigated during a 6-month follow-up in a cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals with CD4(+) cell counts between 100 and 500 cells/microliter and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels >/=10, 000 copies/ml. We determined that the rapid and sustained increase of both naive (CD45RA(+)CD62L(+)) and memory (CD45R0(+) and CD45RA(+)/CD62L(-)) CD4(+) and, to as lesser extent, CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood was associated with a significant decrease of apoptotic CD4(+) and CD8(+) as well as CD3(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Among CD4(+) lymphocytes, at enrollment, the highest frequency of apoptotic cells was observed within the memory compartment, as defined by CD45R0 expression. During HAART, however, the frequency of CD4(+)CD45R0(+) apoptotic T cells progressively decreased in association with a significant downregulation of surface activation markers that indicated decreased levels of systemic immune stimulation. These results indicate that effective viral suppression can contribute to progressive normalization of maturational and functional T cell abnormalities responsible for the high levels of T cell apoptosis in HIV-1-infected individuals. This, in turn, may contribute to a reduced rate of T cell loss and immune reconstitution during HAART."

HCV RNA levels were measured on serial samples of serum stored frozen from 17 HCV+/HIV+ and 17 HCV+/HIV- subjects matched within 5 years of their birth dates. All were HCV+ before study entry. HCV RNA levels were quantitated by a branched DNA-enhanced label amplification (bDNA) assay. For samples less than the cut off, HCV RNA was measured by the nested polymerase chain reaction. Individual changes over time, clinical groups, and mean values within predetermined time windows were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Mean HCV RNA levels increased from 2.76 (standard error [SE] 1.33) x 10(5) to 2.84 (SE 1.39) x 10(6) eq/mL during the first 2 years after HIV seroconversion (P = .006). Baseline HCV RNA levels in the pre-HIV seroconversion group were not significantly different from the baseline levels in those who remained HIV (P = .79). Over the entire period of study, HCV RNA levels increased nearly threefold in those who remained HIV- (mean 9.47 [SE 4.78] x 10(5) to 2.81 [SE 1.13] x 10(6)/mL; P = .02). Among those who became HIV+, HCV RNA levels increased 58-fold (mean 2.85 [SE 1.26] x 10(5) to 1.66 [SE 0.57] x 10(7) eq/mL; P = .0001). The rate of increase in HCV RNA levels was eightfold faster for HIV+ subjects than for subjects who remained HIV- (P = .009). HCV RNA levels increased twofold higher in 5 subjects who developed liver failure compared with the 12 who did not (P = .43). HCV RNA levels correlated significantly with CD4 counts (R = -.33, P = .01) and serum aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) (R = .36, P = .007). We conclude that HCV RNA levels are significantly higher in HIV+ than in HIV- multitransfused hemophiliacs. HCV load increases over time, is enhanced by HIV, and further increases as immune deficiency progresses. HCV RNA levels are directly associated with high AST levels. These findings suggest that HIV-induced immune deficiency may promote increased HCV replication."

Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analyses were used to determine genetic subtype and investigate the relatedness of the sequences. Resistance testing was successful in 117 of 119 patients. The study population represented ∼20% of all patients that were diagnosed in Latvia in 2005 and 2006 and was well distributed between gender, transmission routes, and areas of residence. Four patients showed evidence of TDR, which represents a prevalence of TDR of 3.4% (95% CI: 0.9-8.5%). All four patients displayed single, but different resistance mutations (M46I, F53L, M41L, and G190A). All patients, except one, were predicted to respond well to standard first-line therapy in Latvia. The prevalence of TDR in Latvia was low, which partly may be due to the low proportion of HIV-1 patients who receive antiretroviral therapy. The results indicate that routine resistance testing in Latvia currently should be focused on patients who display treatment failure, rather than treatment naive patients."

FIV is divided into five phylogenetic subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E), based on genetic diversity. Knowledge of the geographical distribution of subtypes is relevant for understanding different disease progressions and for vaccine development. In this study, viral sequences of 26 infected cats from Rio de Janeiro, 8 undergoing treatment with zidovudine (AZT) for at least 5 years, were successfully amplified from blood specimens. gag capsid (CA), pol reverse transcriptase (RT), and env gp120 (V3-V4) regions were analyzed to determine subtypes and to evaluate potential mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance among treated cats. Subtyping based on phylogenetic analysis was performed by the neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods. All of the sequences clustered with subtype B in the three regions, exhibiting low genetic variability. Additionally, we found evidence that the same virus is circulating in animals in close contact. The analysis of FIV RT sequences identified two new putative mutations related to drug resistance located in the RT ""finger"" domain, which has 60% identity to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sequence. Amino acid change K-->R at codons 64 and 69 was found in 25% and 37.5% of the treated animals, respectively. These signatures were comparable to K65R and K70R thymidine-associated mutations found in the HIV-1 HXB2 counterpart. This finding strongly suggests a position correlation between the mutations found in FIV and the K65R and K70R substitutions from drug-resistant HIV-1 strains."

Blood specimens were collected from 41 HIV-1 and 14 HIV-2 patients living in Santiago Island. Half of the patients were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). Pol and env gene sequences were obtained using in-house methods. Phylogenetic analysis was used for viral subtyping and the Stanford Algorithm was used for resistance genotyping. For HIV-1, the amplification of pol and env was possible in 27 patients (66%). HIV-1 patients were infected with subtypes G (13, 48%), B (2, 7%), F1 (2, 7%), and CRF02_AG (2, 7%), and complex recombinant forms including a new C/G variant (n=8, 30%). Drug resistance mutations were detected in the PR and RT of three (10%) treated patients. M41L and K103N transmitted drug resistance mutations were found in 2 of 17 (12%) untreated patients. All 14 HIV-2 isolates belonged to group A. The origin of 12 strains was impossible to determine whereas two strains were closely related to the historic ROD strain. In conclusion, in Cape Verde there is a long-standing HIV-2 epidemic rooted in ROD-like strains and a more recent epidemic of unknown origin. The HIV-1 epidemic is caused by multiple subtypes and complex recombinant forms. Drug resistance HIV-1 strains are present at moderate levels in both treated and untreated patients. Close surveillance in these two populations is crucial to prevent further transmission of drug-resistant strains."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

Four patients with acute hepatitis B and 87 chronic HBV carriers were included in this study. We also investigated the expression of Pre-S2Ag in the liver tissues obtained from 26 chronic HBV carriers by direct fluorescent antibody method. There was a significant correlation between Pre-S2Ag titers and HBsAg titers in sera. Pre-S2Ag titers were higher in sera positive for HBeAg, HBV-related DNA polymerase or HBV-DNA than in sera negative for those markers. The ratio of Pre-S2Ag titers to HBsAg titers, however, was constant irrespective of virus replicative markers. Pre-S2Ag in the liver had almost same intracellular localization with HBsAg in the liver. It was suggested that Pre-S2Ag was expressed with an intimate relation to the expression of HBsAg and was not useful as a virus replicative marker. Pre-S2Ag titers/HBsAg titers tended to be high in patients with chronic active hepatitis and high serum GPT levels compared to patients with chronic inactive hepatitis. This may be explained by the release of Pre-S2Ag in the liver. In addition, all patients positive for Pre-S2Ag on the membrane of hepatocytes had chronic active hepatitis. The overproduction of Pre-S2-containing surface proteins in the liver may have some implication related to cell injury via the immune response to Pre-S2Ag etc. Pre-S2Ab was detected only in few cases of chronic HBV infected patients. The lack of immune response to Pre-S2 region may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."

Three patients (3.3%) had an M46I amino acid substitution in the protease (PR) gene that decreased susceptibility to IDV, RTV, and NFV and one patient (1.1%) had an M184I amino acid substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC. Minor mutations were detected in high frequency in the PR gene. The frequencies of minor mutations to protease inhibitors (PI) were I93L (71.4%), L63P (62.6%), V77I (62.6%), M36I/V (33.0%), A71T/V (22.0%), K20R (6.6%), G16E (6.6%), and L10I (5.5%). The relatedness between subtypes and the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in PR were observed; 63P, 77I, and 71V/T were found in HIV-1 subtype B'/B, 16E, 36I, 20R/I, and 82I in non-B, except for CRF07_BC, 10I in subtype A, and 93L in non-A. Although the primary resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is low among the treatment-naive HIV-1 patients living in Liaoning province, the surveillance and monitoring of drug-resistant HIV-1 should be implemented regularly because of the increased access to antiretroviral therapy in China."

We describe a remarkable case of an HIV-infected patient with advanced stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), completely regressed with the use of HAART alone. He remained disease-free for 6 years and he achieved cure without chemotherapy. Although several cases of low-grade lymphoma with complete regression were reported, we could not find any case of stage IV high-grade malignant lymphoma with HAART alone in complete remission for over 5 years from our review of the literature. This unique case shows the importance of HAART in improving survival and achieving cure in HIV-high-grade malignant lymphoma."

Among 39,086 persons with 71,116 person-years (py) of observation, 585 episodes of pneumococcal disease were diagnosed (incidence, 8.2 episodes per 1000 py). Factors associated with an increased risk for pneumococcal disease (P < .05) included injection drug use (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.5) and blood transfusion (RR, 2.0) as the mode of HIV transmission (referent, male-male sex); black race/ethnicity (RR, 1.5; referent, white race); history of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic illness (RR, 2.1); a CD4(+) cell count of 200-499 cells/microL (RR, 2.5) or < 200 cells/microL (RR, 3.7; referent, CD4(+) cell count of > or = 500 cells/microL); and alcoholism (RR, 2.0).

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delivery of care among a national cohort of US veterans with chronic hepatitis B infection and examine risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from 1999 to 2013 to evaluate (1) care delivery and (2) clinical outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and mortality among US veterans with hepatitis B. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and Cox regression models were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. We identified 21,419 veterans with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, and 97% of patients had alanine aminotransferase and 44% had hepatitis B virus DNA testing; hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B e antibody were tested <50% of the time. Patients receiving specialty care had a higher prevalence of recommended laboratory testing. Patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase in specialty care were more likely to receive antiviral therapy (50% versus 24% for specialty care versus no specialty care, P < 0.001). Among patients with cirrhosis, 69% received one-time liver imaging. The proportion of follow-up time adherent to annual imaging was 0.39 (standard deviation = 0.42), and the proportion was 0.28 (standard deviation = 0.33) for biannual imaging; both proportions were higher in the specialty care group (all P < 0.05). Antiviral therapy (hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.95, P = 0.005) and liver imaging (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.91, P < 0.001) were independently associated with decreased mortality in adjusted analyses."
1960,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Dendritic cells are susceptible to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and may transmit the virus to T cells in vivo. Scarce information is available about drug efficacy in dendritic cells because preclinical testing of antiretroviral drugs has been limited predominantly to T cells and macrophages. We compared the antiviral activities of hydroxyurea and two protease inhibitors (indinavir and ritonavir) in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and in lymphocytes. At therapeutic concentrations (50 to 100 microM), hydroxyurea inhibited supernatant virus production from monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro but the drug was ineffective in activated lymphocytes. Concentrations of hydroxyurea insufficient to be effective in activated lymphocytes cultured alone strongly inhibited supernatant virus production from cocultures of uninfected, activated lymphocytes with previously infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro. In contrast, protease inhibitors were up to 30-fold less efficient in dendritic cells than in activated lymphocytes. Our data support the rationale for testing of the combination of hydroxyurea and protease inhibitors, since these drugs may have complementary antiviral efficacies in different cell compartments. A new criterion for combining drugs for the treatment of HIV infection could be to include at least one drug that selectively targets HIV in viral reservoirs."
8517,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A number of eucaryotic viruses have devised strategies to minimize the deleterious effects on protein synthesis caused by activation of the interferon-induced, double-stranded-RNA-activated protein kinase, P68. In a recent report, we described the down regulation of the P68 protein kinase in cells infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (S. Roy, M. G. Katze, N. T. Parkin, I. Edery, A. G. Hovanessian, and N. Sonenberg, Science 247:1216-1219, (1990). We now present evidence that such a decrease in amounts of P68 could be essential for HIV-1 replication because of the presence of the Tat-responsive sequence (TAR sequence) present in the 5' untranslated region of HIV-1 mRNAs, which activates the P68 kinase. We found that poly(A)+ mRNAs prepared from HIV-1-infected cells efficiently activated the protein kinase as did mRNAs from stably transformed cell lines constitutively expressing the TAR region. Furthermore, we found that TAR-containing RNAs complexed with purified P68 protein kinase in vitro by two independent assays and could be cross-linked to P68 kinase present in a HeLa cell extract. Experiments using in vitro-synthesized wild-type and mutant TAR RNAs revealed that both the efficient binding to and the activation of P68 kinase were dependent on the TAR RNA stem structure. The TAR-P68 complex could be competed out by a synthetic RNA that bound to and activated the protein kinase but not by a synthetic RNA that bound with low affinity and did not activate P68. The possible biological consequences of a P68-TAR interaction that may include the switch from latent to active virus replication are discussed."

To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."

Its soluble form has been shown to bind, in vitro, to human T cells, a process that may carry a negative signal onto these cells. We recently described a novel lymphocyte population in human peripheral blood, a population that expresses an intracellular CD14-like antigen. This novel T-cell population, composed mainly of CD8 cells and of very few CD4 cells, was found to be greatly enhanced in asymptomatic, untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals. In the present study, we further characterized this cell population and found that it differed from other CD8 subpopulations associated with HIV infection such as CD8/CD38. In addition, we followed HIV patients under conditions of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and observed two groups of patients: patients in whom the CD14-like positive-testing T cells returned to normal within 1 to 3 months, and patients in whom it did not, in spite of a significant plasma HIV-RNA viral load decrease. Thus, this new CD14-like positive-testing lymphocyte population may represent an interesting and important component of the cellular events associated with HIV infection. On the basis of its modulation following HAART, we speculate that it may be used, in the future, as a drug-monitoring cellular marker in antiretroviral treatment."

The role of HIV-related factors in renal dysfunction remains unclear. We performed a cross-sectional study at two military clinics with open access to care to determine the impact of HIV factors, including antiretroviral therapy, on renal function. Renal dysfunction was defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). We evaluated 717 HIV patients with a median age of 41 years; 92% were male, 49% Caucasian, and 38% African American; median CD4 count was 515 cells/mm(3) and 73% were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Twenty-two patients (3%) had renal dysfunction. Factors associated with renal dysfunction in the multivariate logistic analyses included older age (odds ratio [OR] 2.0 per 10 year increase, p = 0.006), lower CD4 nadir (OR 0.6 per 100 cell change, p = 0.02), and duration of tenofovir use (OR 1.5 per year use, p = 0.01). Among persons initiating tenofovir (n = 241), 50% experienced a reduction in GFR (median -10.5 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 95% CI, -8.9 to -13.3) within 2 years. Among tenofovir users, factors associated with a reduction in GFR included female gender (p < 0.001), African American ethnicity (p = 0.003), and lower CD4 nadir (p = 0.002). In summary, renal dysfunction was relatively uncommon among our HIV-infected patients, perhaps due to their young age, lack of comorbidities, or as a result of our definition that did not include proteinuria. Renal dysfunction was associated with duration of tenofovir use. Factors associated with renal loss among tenofovir users included female gender, African American ethnicity, and CD4 nadir <200 cells/mm(3). Consideration for more frequent monitoring of kidney function among these select HIV patients may be warranted."

Our objective for this study was to examine the number of days from first HIV-positive result until enrollment into EIP by race/ethnicity, behavioral risk, and other characteristics, with data from clients who enrolled in an EIP site after the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies. For Model I, logistic regression distinguished clients diagnosed with HIV and enrolled in EIP on the same day (0 days) from those with values of 1+ days; linear regression was then used on the log transformation of days for the majority of clients not diagnosed and enrolled on the same day. For Model II, logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics related to enrollment in EIP over 6 weeks from the date of HIV diagnosis. We found that Latinos were more likely than whites to enroll in EIP on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. For clients not diagnosed and enrolled in EIP on the same day, no differences across racial and ethnic groups were found for days until enrollment in HIV care and treatment. However, clients with a history of injection drug use took longer from the day they were diagnosed with HIV to enroll in EIP. The California EIP represents a model for programs seeking equity in access to HIV care and treatment across racial and ethnic groups.

Of a total of 487 patients with AIDS, reported during the seven-year period, 219 (45%) were late testers. Their proportion of all AIDS cases increased from 22% in 1996 to 58% in 2002. Heterosexual route of transmission, age greater than 40 years, and foreign origin were all significant risk factors for being a late tester. Intravenous drug users were associated with a highly significant reduced risk. The group without previously known HIV infection represents an increasing part of all cases of AIDS.

A total of 134 HIV-infected Thai adults were prospectively enrolled to receive a once-daily regimen of efavirenz 600 mg/tenofovir/lamivudine. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CYP2B6 were genotyped using real-time PCR. At 12 weeks after ART, plasma efavirenz concentrations at 12h after dosing were measured. The mean ± standard deviation patient age was 37 ± 8 years, and 77.6% were male. The median (IQR) CD4 count was 43 cells/mm(3) (17-105 cells/mm(3)). Eighteen patients (13.4%) had positive anti-HCV and 5 patients (3.7%) had positive HBsAg. The frequencies of heterozygous/homozygous mutants of each SNP were 64C>T (11%), 499C>G (0%), 516G>T (55%), 785A>G (63%), 1375A>G (0%), 1459C>T (3%) and 21563C>T (62%). The three most frequent haplotypes identified included *1/*6 (40.3%), *1/*1 (34.3%) and *6/*6 (8.2%). The median (IQR) plasma efavirenz concentration was 2.3mg/L (1.4-3.7 mg/L). At 24 weeks, median (IQR) serum ALP was 98 mg/dL (73-133 mg/dL) and direct bilirubin was 0.11 mg/dL (0.10-0.19 mg/dL). The proportion of grade 1 and grade 2 elevated serum ALP was 12.7% and 1.5%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, factors associated with high ALP, total bilirubin and direct bilirubin included CYP2B6 haplotype *6/*6, high serum ALP at Week 0 and positive anti-HCV (all P<0.05).

Therefore, we sought to examine the relationship between blood and semen VL rebound after discontinuation of HAART. Participants in this substudy were men enrolled from two centers of a multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial of HIV therapeutic vaccination using ALVAC with or without Remune. With at least 2 years of sustained virologic suppression and following a 20-week vaccination course, subjects underwent structured HAART interruption. Fourteen men provided semen samples. Seven to 12 weeks after HAART interruption, all 14 men had detectable blood VLs whereas 8 of 14 had detectable seminal VLs. There was a significant correlation between blood and seminal VLs (Spearman r=0.58, p=0.03) at the time of semen collection. An earlier time to detectable blood VL after HAART interruption was associated with higher seminal VL (Spearman r=-0.64, p=0.02).

Over this period, declining rates of carriage of Candida albicans (from 61% to 39%; P = .008) and of oropharyngeal candidiasis (from 30% to 4%; P < .001) were documented. Trends toward reduction in the frequency of fluconazole-resistant isolates (MIC, > or = 64 micrograms/mL) were also seen. During the survey period, the mean (median) number of antiretroviral agents used per patient rose from 0.5 (0) to 1.8 (2) (P < .001). Thus, rather than progression, we observed declining rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis, C. albicans carriage, and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans in a cohort of HIV-infected patients treated with increasingly effective antiretroviral therapy."

Although several in vitro activities have been attributed to the Nef protein, identifying the one critical for in vivo pathogenicity remains elusive. In this study, we examined a large number of nef alleles derived at various time points from 13 perinatally infected children showing different progression rates: six nonprogressors (NPs), three slow progressors (SPs), and four rapid progressors (RPs). The patient-derived nef alleles were analyzed for their steady-state expression of a Nef protein, for their relative ability to downregulate cell surface expression of CD4 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and for their capacity to bind the clathrin adaptor AP-1 complex. We found that NP-derived nef alleles, compared to nef alleles isolated from SPs and RPs, had reduced CD4 and MHC-I downregulation activities. In contrast, SP- and RP-derived nef alleles did not differ and efficiently downregulated both CD4 and MHC-I. AP-1 binding was a conserved function of primary nef alleles not correlated with clinical progression. Defective Nef proteins from NPs, rather than sharing common specific changes in their sequences, accumulated various amino acid substitutions, mainly located outside the conserved domains previously associated with Nef biological properties. Our data indicate that Nef-mediated downregulation of cell surface CD4 and MHC-I significantly contributes to the expression of the pathogenic potential of HIV-1."

Three years later (2002), the same patient charts were reviewed for evidence of new-onset diabetes. Ten percent of the subjects were identified as diabetic at baseline. The prevalence of diabetes was 12% among those who were taking PIs, compared to 0% among those who were not taking PIs. The incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes during this three-year period was 7.2%. Diabetes occurred only in the group taking PIs. Diabetic subjects were older than their nondiabetic counterparts. All were African Americans. Our study suggests that PIs increase the likelihood of diabetes developing with increasing age in African Americans infected with HIV."

We report here on molecular virological and epidemiological analyses involving 229 patients who underwent exposure-prone operations by an HCV-infected orthopedic surgeon. Of the 229 individuals affected, 207 could be tested. Three were positive for HCV antibodies. Molecular and epidemiological investigation revealed that two of them were not infected by the surgeon. The third patient, a 50-year-old man, underwent complicated total hip arthroplasty with trochanteric osteotomy. He harbored an HCV 2b isolate that in phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1) was closely related to the HCV strain recovered from the infected surgeon, indicating that HCV-provider-to-patient transmission occurred intraoperatively. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of HCV transmission by an orthopedic surgeon. The recorded transmission rate of 0.48% (95% confidence interval: 0.09-2.68%) was within the same range reported previously for the spread of hepatitis B virus during orthopedic procedures. Since the result of our investigation sustains the notion that patients may contract HCV from infected health-care workers during exposure-prone procedures, a series of further retrospective exercises is needed to assess more precisely the risk of HCV provider-to-patient transmission and to delineate from these studies recommendations for the guidance and management of HCV-infected medical personnel."

This prospective study aimed to find out the clinical, biochemical & virological profile of chronic HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patient attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University. A total of 90 cases were studied from October 2007 to October 2009. Univariate analysis was done. The study showed that most of the patients of chronic HBV are clinically asymptomatic, biochemically normal or near normal. Most of the chronic HBV infected patients are virologically HBeAg positive (77.8%). Therefore screening for asymptomatic HBV infection is essential for early diagnosis and treatment."

In this country, serological screening of hepatitis viruses B and C is only systematic among blood donors. The aims of this study were; (1) to investigate the reasons for the prescription of the screening for hepatitis B and C; (2) to determine HCV and HBV prevalence among 462 patients attending the Saint Camille Centre and (3) to identify patients with acute hepatitis or with chronic hepatitis for better monitoring. From February to May 2012, 462 patients attending the laboratory of the Saint Camille Medical Centre with viral hepatitis suspicion were screened. The hepatitis B and C serological markers were detected through Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) technique using commercial reagent kits. The clinical symptoms were also recorded for each patient. The results revealed that, the main clinical symptoms that prompted physicians to request HBV and HCV screenings were: asthenia (39.4%), anorexia (21.2%), abdominal pains (19.0%), nausea (10.4%), others (10.0%). The prevalence of HbsAg was 29.4% among the screened people. Patients with acute hepatitis B, active chronic hepatitis B and non-active chronic hepatitis B represented 11.2, 2.2 and 16.0%, respectively. The acquisition of immunity against HBV after vaccination was attempted for 11.7% people. HCV prevalence was 3.9% and its coinfection with HBV was 2.2%. This study showed a high prevalence for hepatitis B and C among patients attending Saint Camille Medical Centre. Without hygiene education and HBV/HCV prevention, viral hepatitis infection will become a serious public health problem in Burkina Faso."

The endemicity of HBV varies by region. Because chronic hepatitis B is infectious and persons with chronic infection benefit from treatment, CDC recommends screening for HBV among all refugees who originate in countries where the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg; a marker for acute or chronic infection) is ≥2% or who are at risk for HBV because of personal characteristics such as injection drug use or household contact with an individual with HBV infection. Currently, almost all refugees are routinely screened for hepatitis B. However, prevalence rates of HBV infection in refugee populations recently resettled in the United States have not been determined. A multisite, retrospective study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of past HBV infection, current infection, and immunity among refugees resettled in the United States; to better characterize the burden of hepatitis B in this population; and to inform screening recommendations. The study incorporated surveillance data from a large state refugee health program and chart reviews from three U.S. sites that conduct medical screenings of refugees. The prevalence of HBV infection (current or past as determined by available titer levels) varied among refugees originating in different countries and was higher among Burmese refugees than among refugees from Bhutan or Iraq. Current or past HBV infection was also higher among adults (aged >18 years) and male refugees. These data might help inform planning by states and resettlement agencies, as well as screening decisions by health care providers. "

In this study, the SIV-infected rhesus macaque model was used to assess recombinant simian IL-7 in its glycosylated form (rsIL-7gly) to enhance regeneration of CD4(+) T cells, particularly the crucial central memory compartment, after ART. We assessed the impact of rsIL-7gly administration as single injections and as a cluster of three doses. Irrespective of the dosing strategy used, the rsIL-7gly administration transiently increased proliferation of both central memory and naive cells, in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets, without increasing SIV levels in the blood. Administration of rsIL-7gly at intervals of 4-6 wk maximized the proliferative response to therapy but resulted in only transient increases in peripheral blood T cell counts. Although more frequent rsIL-7gly ""clustered"" dosing (three times weekly with 2 wk of rest and then repeat) induced only an initial proliferative burst by CD4(+) T cells, this dosing strategy resulted in sustained increases in peripheral blood CD4(+) T cell counts. The clustered rsIL-7gly treatment regimen was shown to increase the half-life of a BrdU label among memory T cells in the blood when compared with that of macaques treated with ART alone, which is consistent with enhanced cell survival. These results indicate that dosing intervals have a major impact on the response to rsIL-7gly in SIV-positive ART-treated rhesus macaques and that optimum dosing strategies may be ones that induce CD4(+) T cell proliferation initially and provide increased CD4(+) T cell survival."

The occurrence of pathogen-negative diarrhea led to speculation that local HIV infection is etiologic. Mucosal cellular reservoirs for HIV were documented by use of several techniques. Correlations were found among gastrointestinal symptoms, histopathologic findings, cytokine expression, lymphoid apoptosis, and HIV RNA and protein expression in rectal mucosa. Disproportionate depletion of mucosal CD4+ lymphocytes also was found. The short-term effects of antiretroviral therapies were examined to test the hypothesis that these changes are directly related to mucosal HIV infection. Therapy was associated with decreased symptoms, with comparable drops in peripheral blood and mucosal HIV RNA contents, and by increases in blood and mucosal CD4+ lymphocyte contents. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells also declined during therapy. These results suggest that HIV plays a direct role in producing intestinal dysfunction."
2301,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
5127,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay is increasingly used in vaccine clinical trials to measure antigen-specific T-cell mediated immune (CMI) responses in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood. However, recent observations indicate that several parameters involved in blood processing can impact PBMC viability and CMI responses, especially in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve HIV-1-infected individuals. In this phase I study (NCT01610427), we collected blood samples from 22 ART-naïve HIV-1-infected adults. PBMCs were isolated and processed for ICS assay. The individual and combined effects of the following parameters were investigated: time between blood collection and PBMC processing (time-to-process: 2, 7 or 24 h); time between PBMC thawing and initiation of in vitro stimulation with HIV-1 antigens (resting-time: 0, 2, 6 and 18 h); and duration of antigen-stimulation in PBMC cultures (stimulation-time: 6h or overnight). The cell recovery after thawing, cell viability after ICS and magnitude of HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were considered to determine the optimal combination of process conditions. The impact of time-to-process (2 or 4 h) on HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses was also assessed in a whole blood ICS assay. A higher quality of cells in terms of recovery and viability (up to 81% and >80% respectively) was obtained with shorter time-to-process (less than 7 h) and resting-time (less than 2 h) intervals. Longer (overnight) rather than shorter (6 h) stimulation-time intervals increased the frequency of CD8(+)-specific T-cell responses using ICS in PBMCs without change of the functionality. The CD8(+) specific T-cell responses detected using fresh whole blood showed a good correlation with the responses detected using frozen PBMCs. Our results support the need of standardized procedures for the evaluation of CMI responses, especially in HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve patients."
9145,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A subset of women in the Pumwani Sex Worker Cohort, established in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya, remains uninfected despite repeated high-risk exposure (HIV-exposed, seronegative [HESN]) through active sex work. This HESN phenotype is associated with several alleles of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses to HIV-1. The associations of HLA alleles with differential HIV-1 infection are most likely due to their different abilities to present antigen and the different immune responses they induce. The characteristics of epitopes of HLA alleles associated with different outcomes of HIV-1 infection might therefore point to a vital clue for developing an effective vaccine. In this study, we systematically analyzed HIV-1 clade A and D Gag CD8(+) T cell epitopes of two HLA class I alleles associated with different outcomes of HIV-1 infection. Binding affinity and off-rates of the identified epitopes were determined. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays with patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) validated the epitopes. Epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells were further phenotyped for memory markers with tetramer staining. Our study showed that the protective allele A*01:01 recognizes only three Gag epitopes. By contrast, B*07:02, the allele associated with susceptibility, binds 30 epitope variants. These two alleles differ most importantly in the spectrum of Gag epitopes they can present and not in affinity, off-rates, the location of the epitopes, or epitope-specific Tem/Tcm frequencies. The binding of more epitopes and strong IFN-gamma ELISpot responses are associated with susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, while more focused antigen recognition of multiple subtypes is protective. Rational vaccine design should take these observations into account."
8827,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Although the high incidence of EBV-associated diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) in HIV-1 infection is believed to be related to loss of immune control due to HIV-induced immune deficiency, it has been claimed that cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to EBV are longer lasting in HIV-1-infected persons than CTL directed against HIV-1 itself. We approached this apparent paradox by performing the first longitudinal study into the kinetics of EBV and HIV-specific CTL responses in HIV-infected patients progressing either to AIDS with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or AIDS with opportunistic infection (OI). Multiple samples were tested from HIV-1 seroconversion to AIDS-diagnosis. Four out of six patients that were either long-term asymptomatic or progressing to OI showed declining HIV-1 CTL precursor (CTLp) frequencies whereas EBV-CTLp remained stable, suggestive for HIV-1-specific immune exhaustion. In two patients rapidly progressing to AIDS-OI, a parallel decline of HIV-1- and EBV-CTL responses was seen, indicative for total collapse of cellular immunity. In all these six patients EBV-load remained low. However, in four out of five patients that progressed to DLCL, EBV-load was high and increasing several months preceding the NHL. In all five patients, EBV-CTLp decreased before the emergence of the NHL. Thus, our data show that in HIV-1 infection loss of HIV-1-specific T cell immunity is not necessarily paralleled by loss of EBV-specific T cell responses. The occurrence of AIDS-related DLCL is preceded by decreasing EBV-CTLp and increasing EBV load. Failing EBV-control might therefore be an important step in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related DLCL."
1513,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Increasing evidence suggests that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD4 T-cell responses contribute to effective immune control of HIV-1 infection. However, the breadths and specificities of these responses have not been defined. We screened fresh CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 36 subjects at different stages of HIV-1 infection for virus-specific CD4 responses by gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot assay, using 410 overlapping peptides spanning all HIV-1 proteins (based on the clade B consensus sequence). HIV-1-specific CD4 responses were identified in 30 of the 36 individuals studied, with the strongest and broadest responses detected in persons treated in acute infection who underwent treatment interruption. In individuals with identified responses, the total number of recognized HIV-1 peptides ranged from 1 to 36 (median, 7) and the total magnitude of responses ranged from 80 to >14,600 (median, 990) spot-forming cells/10(6) CD8-depleted PBMC. Neither the total magnitude nor the number of responses correlated with viremia. The most frequent and robust responses were directed against epitopes within the Gag and Nef proteins. Peptides targeted by >/=25% of individuals were then tested for binding to a panel of common HLA-DR molecules. All bound broadly to at least four of the eight alleles tested, and two bound to all of the HLA-DR molecules studied. Fine mapping and HLA restriction of the responses against four of these peptides showed a combination of clustering of epitopes and promiscuous presentation of the same epitopes by different HLA class II alleles. These findings have implications for the design of immunotherapeutic strategies and for testing candidate HIV vaccines."
8451,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"To determine the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CD8+ T cells on the development of drug resistance mutations in the HIV-1 protease, we analyzed protease sequences from viruses from a human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA class I)-typed cohort of 94 HIV-1-positive individuals. In univariate statistical analyses (Fisher's exact test), minor and major drug resistance mutations as well as drug-associated polymorphisms showed associations with HLA class I alleles. All correlations with P values of 0.05 or less were considered to be relevant without corrections for multiple tests. A subset of these observed correlations was experimentally validated by enzyme-linked immunospot assays, allowing the definition of 10 new epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells from patients with the appropriate HLA class I type. Several drug resistance-associated mutations in the protease acted as escape mutations; however, cells from many patients were still able to generate CD8+ T cells targeting the escape mutants. This result presumably indicates the usage of different T-cell receptors by CD8+ T cells targeting these epitopes in these patients. Our results support a fundamental role for HLA class I-restricted immune responses in shaping the sequence of the HIV-1 protease in vivo. This role may have important clinical implications both for the understanding of drug resistance pathways and for the design of therapeutic vaccines targeting drug-resistant HIV-1."
4503,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Since the onset of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic fifteen years ago, much has been learned about the effects of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the nervous system. This review summarizes the pathology findings in the central nervous system (CNS). There is now abundant evidence that HIV can infect the CNS directly, leading to a characteristic HIV encephalitis (HIVE) which occurs in 10-50 p. 100 of AIDS autopsy series. Multinucleated giant cells are the pathognomonic feature of HIVE and are found predominantly in the central white matter and deep grey matter. Evidence of productive HIV infection in the CNS is confined to cells of the microglial/macrophage lineage, from which the giant cells are almost certainly derived. These cells are known to express both CD4 and beta-chemokine receptors, which act in conjunction to permit HIV entry. Restricted infection of astrocytes has also been identified by a variety of methods. HIVE is frequently associated with white matter damage ranging from inflammatory (microglia, macrophages and sparse lymphocytes) to degenerative (myelin loss and axonal damage) pathology. Although giant cells are seen less frequently in neocortical grey matter, significant neuronal loss has been established in a number of studies. Recent investigations using markers of apoptosis, (including TUNEL, Bcl-2 and BAX), have established the presence of DNA damage in some neurons and in other cell types. Axonal damage has also been confirmed by evidence of amyloid precursor protein expression. The CNS is also vulnerable to opportunistic infections and high grade B-cell lymphomas as a result of the immune suppression of advanced HIV infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is reported in 10-30 p. 100 of AIDS cases at autopsy, toxoplasma in 10-25 p. 100, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy in about 5 p. 100 and lymphomas, usually primary, in up to 10 p. 100. A wide variety of other infections has also been reported. These may coexist with HIVE and may be difficult to diagnose in life. CMV gives rise to microglial nodular encephalitis, ventriculitis, necrotising encephalitis and myelo-radiculitis. Presymptomatic HIV positive patients do not show HIVE or opportunistic infections or lymphomas in the CNS. They frequently display a low-grade T-cell infiltrate in the leptomeninges and parenchyma, particularly around vessels. This lymphocytic infiltrate has been attributed to presumed early invasion of the CNS by HIV although the exact timing of entry is uncertain. It is possible that reported abnormalities in presymptomatic cases such as gliosis, microglial activation and rising proviral load may anticipate the onset of HIVE but most studies show that significant CNS damage and HIV-related pathology is confined to patients with AIDS. HIV-related pathology in the spinal cord includes not only HIV myelitis, opportunistic infections and lymphomas, but also vacuolar myelopathy (VM) which affects predominantly the dorsolateral white matter tracts. The cause of VM is not understood and has not been unequivocally linked with HIV infection. It is noted that none of these neuropathological features (including HIVE) correlates exactly with the clinical expression of AIDS-related dementia (ARD). The exact contribution of macrophage activation and cytokine release, astrocytic infection, neuronal loss and axonal damage to the neuropsychiatric syndromes of advanced HIV infection remain to be determined. While the current understanding of the pathogenesis of HIVE and ARD is beyond the scope of this review it is axiomatic that accurate documentation of neuropathology findings will help to resolve the outstanding dilemmas relating to HIV infection of the CNS. There is considerable optimism that progress in therapeutic regimes for HIV-infected patients will succeed in eliminating the virus from the blood and from lymphoid tissue. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

Clearance rates of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in peripheral blood as well as the preexistence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV were determined over 52 weeks of treatment. The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia."

Complete adherence (more than 95% of drugs actually taken) during the first 4 months of therapy appears crucial in maintaining virological response to therapy over time. Adherence depends on how patients experience the treatment but also on external factors such as their relationship with physicians and social workers. Virological failures were classified in two groups: those sensitive to the PI prescribed and related to poor adherence (no detectable PI) or patients with resistance related to pharmacokinetic issues (detectable but insufficient PI levels). Between April 1997 and May 2004, 118 patients died, and 188 episodes of AIDS and 1178 other severe events were recorded. Follow-up at 5 years was estimated at 90% and the probability of progression towards a new episode of AIDS 16%. Risk of AIDS onset was greatest during the first year and declined thereafter. Severe morbidity unrelated to AIDS or the side effects of treatment was frequent and gradually predominated. The only patients for whom AIDS was the most frequent severe morbidity were those who started treatment with CD4 cell counts < 50/mm3. The cumulative probability of a serious antiretroviral-induced adverse event (mainly hypertransaminasemia) was 30% at 5 years; 2/3 of these events occurred during the first 6 months of follow-up. Factors associated with the 169 events attributed to the first PI prescribed included: plasma HIV RNA >100,000 copies/ml, increased transaminase levels, creatinine clearance <70 ml/min, HCV or HBV co-infection, and prescription of indinavir. Other studies are underway on the associated factors specific to each of the events to delineate the respective roles of the virus, the treatments and other factors."
2307,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Myeloid cells are important reservoirs of HIV-1 infection. In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS."

Production was detected by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA assay in blood mononuclear cells in 54% of asymptomatic, 71% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, and 100% of AIDS patients. When the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated into monocytes and CD4+ T cells, we found that the CD4+ T-cell fraction was preferentially infected in the three clinical stages. The ability to isolate HIV from blood monocyte-derived macrophages was similar in the three stages (24-33%) and required coculture with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. Bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells cultured simultaneously yielded virus from both sources in 13 individuals. Again the prime source of virus was the nonadherent bone marrow mononuclear cells, which contained CD4+ T cells, and not the adherent monocyte-enriched fraction. We conclude that blood mononuclear cells yield productive virus more readily as disease progresses and that infection is detected in association with CD4+ T-cell-enriched fractions. In our large sample of patients, monocyte infection was detected in only a small fraction, suggesting that this cell type is neither a primary nor an exclusive reservoir of HIV infection."
6241,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."

We studied the cellular immune responses of peripheral lymphocytes using proliferating assays, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and ELISPOT interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assays after non-specific and specific stimulation with whole HBV proteins and synthetic peptides. Thirty patients with HBeAg negative CHB, eleven HBsAg inactive carriers, nine patients with acute hepatitis B and 22 healthy controls were included in the study. Patients with HBeAg negative CHB demonstrated an increased number of peripheral CD8+ T cells while their peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed increased proliferation after in vitro stimulation with overlapping hepatitis B core derived peptides and an envelope derived epitope (HBs 182-191 aa), similar to those observed in acute hepatitis B. Using ICS, we found an expanded population of IFN-gamma producing T lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+, after non-specific stimulation, in HBeAg negative CHB compared to all other groups. HBeAg negative CHB and acute hepatitis B patients had a similarly increased number of core specific T cells measured by the IFN-gamma assays. Inactive HBsAg carriers showed minimal proliferative responses overall while they exhibited an increased number of envelope specific effector T cells (measured by ICS). In conclusion, we showed that overall CD4+ T cell responses from patients with HBeAg negative CHB were comparable to those of acute hepatitis B, while inactive HBsAg carriers despite their limited proliferative capacity the effector activity of their peripheral T cells was maintained."

Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."

Bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture were characterized in 38 HIV-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (18 perinatally-infected, 20 adolescence-infected) and 20 uninfected men age 20 to 25 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CD4+/CD8+ activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28-CD57+) and to quantify circulating osteogenic precursor (COP) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibodies to RUNX2 and osteocalcin (OCN). Telomere lengths were measured in sorted COP cells using qPCR. DXA-derived areal BMD Z-scores and HRpQCT-derived volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected men. Proportion of activated and senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in HIV-infected than uninfected men. The percentage of COP cells (mean ± SE) was lower in HIV-infected than uninfected (0.19% ± 0.02% versus 0.43% ± 0.06%; p < 0.0001) men, and also lower in perinatally-infected than adolescence-infected men (0.15% ± 0.02% versus 0.22% ± 0.03%; p < 0.04). A higher proportion of COP cells correlated with higher bone stiffness, a measure of bone strength, whereas a higher proportion of activated CD4+ T cells correlated with lower BMD and stiffness and lower proportion of COP cells. T cell activation with HIV-infection was associated with decreased numbers of osteogenic precursors as well as lower peak bone mass and bone strength. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."

The essential trace element selenium has an important function in maintaining immune processes and may, thus, have a critical role in clearance of mycobacteria. The impact of selenium status on the development of mycobacterial diseases in HIV-1-seropositive drug users was investigated over a 2-year period (1999-2001). Twelve cases of mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis, 9; infection due to atypical Mycobacterium species, 3) occurred; these 12 cases were compared with 32 controls with no history of respiratory infections who were matched on age, sex, and HIV status. Significant risk for development of mycobacterial disease was associated with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm 3, malnutrition, and selenium levels of <or=135 microg/L (patients with these levels were 13 times more likely to develop mycobacterial disease). Multivariate analyses controlling for antiretroviral treatment and CD4 cell count revealed that both body mass index and selenium level remained significant factors in the relative risk for developing mycobacterial disease (relative risk, 3; p =.015); these findings suggest that selenium status may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease."

Viral reverse transcriptase and protease genotype and HIV-specific CD4 T-cell responses were determined using patient-derived samples. Clinical and immunologic benefits were maintained in patients with partial virologic suppression (<or=10000 copies/mL). Although low-level viral replication under drug pressure led to the accumulation of resistance mutations in most subjects' viruses, most subjects retained susceptibility to drugs in >or=2 classes of antiretroviral medications.

HCV RNA was detected in the saliva of 22/59 (37.3%) patients, with a mean level of 1.15 x 10(6) genome equivalents/ml; there was no correlation of salivary positivity with immune status (CD4 cell count), age or HIV risk group, but there was with gender (19/38 [50%] positive results in male, compared to 3/21 [14.3%] in female, P = 0.007). HCV RNA was detected in the serum of 45/59 (76.3%) patients at a higher level (mean of 2.52 x 10(7) genome equivalents/ml) compared to saliva. Positivity was not correlated with age, gender or CD4 + cell count. There was a correlation between qualitative saliva and serum results (P = 0.003), but not between quantifications (P = 0.57).

7940,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Recent evidence suggests that primary patient isolates of T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 ) have lower affinities for CD4 than their laboratory-adapted derivatives, that this may partly result from tighter gp120-gp41 bonds that constrain the CD4 binding sites of the primary viruses, and that selection for increased CD4 affinity may be the principal factor in laboratory adaptation of HIV-1 (S. L. Kozak, E. J. Platt, N. Madani, F. E. Ferro, Jr., K. Peden, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 71:873-882, 1997). These conclusions were based on studies with a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that differ in CD4 levels over a broad range, with laboratory-adapted viruses infecting all clones with equal efficiencies and primary T-cell-tropic viruses infecting the clones in proportion to cellular CD4 levels. Additionally, all of the primary and laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic viruses efficiently used CXCR-4 (fusin) as a coreceptor. To test these conclusions by an independent approach, we studied mutations in the laboratory-adapted virus LAV/IIIB that alter the CD)4 binding region of gp120 and specifically reduce CD4 affinities of free gp 120 by 85 to 98% (U. Olshevsky et al., J. Virol. 64:5701-5707, 1990). These mutations reduced virus titers to widely varying extents that ranged from severalfold to several orders of magnitude and converted infectivities on the HeLa-CD4 panel from CD4 independency to a high degree of CD4 dependency that resembled the behavior of primary patient viruses. The relative infectivities of the mutants correlated closely with their sensitivities to inactivation by soluble CD4 but did not correlate with the relative CD4 affinities of their free gp120s. Most of the mutations did not substantially alter envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing, expression on cell surfaces, incorporation into virions, or rates of gp120 shedding from virions. However, one mutation (D457R) caused a decrease in gp160 processing by approximately 80%. The fact that several mutations increased rates of spontaneous viral inactivation (especially D368P) suggests that HIV-1 life spans may be determined by structural stabilities of viral envelope glycoproteins. All of the wild-type and mutant viruses were only slowly and inefficiently adsorbed onto cultured CD4-positive cells at 37 degrees C, and the gradual declines in viral titers in the media were caused almost exclusively by spontaneous inactivation rather than by adsorption. The extreme inefficiency with which infectious HIV-1 is able to infect cultured susceptible CD4-positive cells in standard assay conditions casts doubt on previous inferences that the vast majority of retrovirions produced in cultures are noninfectious. Apparent infectivity of T-cell-tropic HIV-1 in culture is limited by productive associations with CD4 and is influenced in an interdependent manner by CD4 affinities of viral gp120-gp41 complexes and quantities of cell surface CD4."

However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that HIV infection of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following HIV infection with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular HBsAg when measured by Western blotting, quantitative HBsAg, and fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that HIV infection of HBV-infected hepatic cell lines significantly increased intracellular HBsAg but not HBV DNA synthesis and that increased intrahepatic HBsAg secondary to direct infection by HIV may contribute to accelerated liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals."

This study aimed to explore the basis for early phase R5 and X4 HIV-1 infection in vivo by using humanized mice dually challenged with R5 HIV-1NLAD8-D harboring DsRed and X4 HIV-1(NL-E) harboring EGFP. Whereas R5 HIV-1 replicated well, X4 HIV-1 caused only transient viremia with variable kinetics; however, this was distinct from the low level but persistent viremia observed in mice challenged with X4 HIV-1 alone. Flow cytometric analysis of HIV-1-infected cells revealed that X4 HIV-1 infection of CCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells was significantly suppressed in the presence of R5 HIV-1. X4 HIV-1 was more cytopathic than R5 HIV-1; however, this was not the cause of restricted X4 HIV-1 infection because there were no significant differences in the mortality rates of CCR5(+) and CCR5(-) cells within the X4 HIV-1-infected cell populations. Taken together, these results suggest that restricted infection of CCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells by X4 HIV-1 (occurring via a still-to-be-identified mechanism) might contribute to the preferential transmission of R5 HIV-1 during the early phase of infection."
7977,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Renal disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent comorbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The increase in life expectancy following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the long-term development of metabolic complications (such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia), hypertension, and vascular diseases can contribute to the increasing frequency in the recognition of renal impairment in HIV-infected patients. Some antiretroviral agents, and particularly tenofovir, have been associated with nephrotoxic drug effects, including decline in glomerular filtration rate, proximal tubular damage, and acute kidney injury. The occurrence of clinically evident renal toxicity in patients treated with HAART seems to be very low, but glomerular or tubular subclinical dysfunction may occur more frequently. Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring for the early recognition of renal abnormalities is recommended for all subjects receiving antiretroviral treatment. In this article, the current knowledge about the nephrotoxic effects of antiretroviral agents has been reviewed, and an algorithm for screening and management of HAART-related kidney disease is proposed in the light of the most recent clinical studies and international guidelines."

In cultured cells, the HIV-1 Tat protein can induce the expression of the cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10, which are known to induce proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells. Such alterations in cytokine expression, together with a secondary genetic event, are thought to ultimately lead to oncogenic transformation. To address the influence of Tat on lymphoid development in the context of the whole organism, we produced several transgenic mouse lines that express the Tat gene under the control of an actin promoter. We show here that this promoter directs expression to a variety of sites, including spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Approximately 25% to 30% of the Tat-transgenic population developed enlarged spleens within 1 year after birth. On histological examination, a significant number of spleens from Tat-transgenic mice exhibited malignant lymphoma of B-cell origin. IgG heavy chain rearrangement confirmed the clonal B-cell nature of these lymphoproliferations. In contrast, T-cell receptor genes exhibited a germline (unrearranged) structure. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of transgenic spleens revealed that mRNA encoding cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 was upregulated, suggesting a possible mechanism for the B-cell expansion in vivo."

In this study, we show that HIV-1-infected macrophages produce factors that impair the development of neuronal precursor cells and that soluble viral protein R (Vpr) is one of the factors that has the ability to suppress axonal growth. Cell biological analysis revealed that extracellularly administered recombinant Vpr (rVpr) clearly accumulated in mitochondria where a Vpr-binding protein adenine nucleotide translocator localizes and also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, which led to ATP synthesis. The depletion of ATP synthesis reduced the transportation of mitochondria within neurites. This mitochondrial dysfunction inhibited axonal growth even when the frequency of apoptosis was not significant. We also found that point mutations of arginine (R) residues to alanine (A) residues at positions 73, 77, and 80 rendered rVpr incapable of causing mitochondrial membrane depolarization and axonal growth inhibition. Moreover, the Vpr-induced inhibition was suppressed after treatment with a ubiquinone analogue (ubiquinone-10). Our results suggest that soluble Vpr is a major viral factor that causes a disturbance in neuronal development through the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction. Since ubiquinone-10 protects the neuronal plasticity in vitro, it may be a therapeutic agent that can offer defense against HIV-1-associated neurological disease."

HIV-1 virus particles possess a novel 72 kD protein, Topoisomerase II beta kinase (Topo IIβKHIV) activity. The enzyme, isolated and purified from PEGprecipitated HIV-1 particles, is insensitive against a diverse set of known kinase inhibitors. The pyridine derivatives were found to be active against both Topo IIβKHIV activity and HIV-1 replication. For both kinase antagonism and anti-HIV-1 activity the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) models were proposed. The CoMFA model was also evaluated independently with a set of test molecules for their anti-viral activity. The kinase inhibition and anti-viral activities for these inhibitors, tested in an in vitro kinase agree with the CoMFA model (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.642 with six principal components), lower acceptable results are obtained with anti- HIV-1 activity (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.358 with four principal components) and also correlate with relative solvation free energy calculations. The predictive power of the models was evaluated with 2 test molecules each and tends to lie within 1 log unit. An in cell validation of the model with a representative inhibitor, 2-methoxypyridine shows its ability to inhibit Topo IIβ phosphorylation during acute HIV-1 infection. Close correlation of molecular fields of inhibitory domains of kinase and HIV-1 inhibitors suggests specificity of action of pyridine derivatives in affecting HIV-1 replication through inhibition of Kinase activity. These investigations suggest that Topo IIβKHIV is a potential target for an effective control of HIV-1 replication that would help in developing new anti-retroviral molecules. "

We found two unsaturated acyclic nucleoside derivatives, adenallene [9-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)adenine] and cytallene [1-(4'-hydroxy-1',2'-butadienyl)cytosine], that protect various CD4+ T-cell lines from the infectivity and cytopathic effect of HIV-1. These compounds inhibit the expression of HIV-1 gag-encoded protein and suppress viral DNA synthesis at concentrations that do not affect functions of normal T cells in vitro. They also inhibit the in vitro infectivity of another human retrovirus, HIV-2. Further in vitro analyses of the anti-HIV-1 activity revealed that the presence of two cumulated double bonds between the 1' and 2' carbons and between the 2' and 3' carbons confers antiretroviral activity in certain pyrimidine or purine derivatives containing a four-carbon chain. We have also found that the 4'-hydroxyl group is critical for the in vitro anti-HIV activity of adenallene. Our observations may provide structure-activity relationships for acyclic nucleoside analogues and may be of value in developing a new class of experimental drugs for the therapy of HIV-related diseases."

Building on recent reports by Lehr and Zimmer (1986, DMW 111, 1001-1002) that the membrane-reactive, anti-epileptic drug diphenylhydantoin (dilantin or phenytoin) (PHT) inhibited binding of HIV to lymphocytes, we hypothesized that understanding the relevant effects of this drug on cells may shed light on aspects of HIV-1 infection. We found that PHT inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, de novo infection of various T-cell lines as well as a monocytic cell line. Moderate inhibition of HIV-1 infection was observed with drug concentrations that are therapeutic in vivo for epilepsy (approximately 20 micrograms/ml), and no concentrations used induced deleterious effects on cell growth or viability. Surprisingly, treatment of chronically infected H9 cells reduced HIV p24 expression within 1-6 weeks according to dose. This apparent induction into latency was not inhibited by cotreatment of the chronically infected cells with 5-azacytidine, which indicated that PHT was not inducing latency by induction of methylation of the viral DNA. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that PHT did not significantly reduce cell-surface expression of CD4. The possibility remained that the drug inhibited HIV infection due to its known effects on calcium-dependent cellular processes. Subsequent measurements of intracellular calcium demonstrated that an increase of [Ca2+]i occurred at least 24 hr postinfection, prior to synthesis of detectable viral structural protein p24, and that this virus-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was not due to binding of HIV to the cell. This HIV-induced rise in [Ca2+]i was significantly inhibited by PHT. PHT demonstrated variable inhibitory effects on infection of normal PHA-stimulated PBLs cultured in vitro, but it was synergistic to low-dose AZT (0.01 microgram/ml) in inhibiting infection of cell lines. Because of the known inhibitory effects of PHT on calcium-dependent biochemical processes in the cell, inhibition of HIV-1 infection by PHT suggests that calcium may play a role in HIV infection and maintenance. The drug may also be a candidate therapy for individuals infected with HIV."

The antigen was present in the cytoplasm of liver cells only. The immunoreactive signal appeared as large, distinct, brilliant fluorescent granules with no clear relationship to cellular structures. No obvious membrane c100 antigen accumulation was observed. Distribution of c100-containing hepatocytes was directly correlated with viral replication in acute hepatitis. All three acute-hepatitis patients were positive for hepatitis C virus RNA (as detected on polymerase chain reaction) in serum and displayed c100 antigen in 50% to 70% of hepatocytes, with a distinct topographical relationship with necrotic areas and inflammatory cell accumulation. Conversely, very low numbers of infected cells and no relationship between tissue c100 antigen expression and sites of liver cell necrosis and inflammation were found in 14 chronic hepatitis C virus infection patients. Furthermore, though all patients had measurable levels of serum hepatitis C virus RNA, only eight (57%) had detectable c100 antigen in liver sections. Indeed, these two distinct immunopathological patterns were inversely related to the development of c100 antibody in serum. Specificity of hepatocellular c100 antigen deposits was established through extensive absorption experiments using structural and nonstructural hepatitis C virus recombinant proteins. However, tissue processing was found to be a crucial step in the demonstration of hepatitis C virus antigen in fresh frozen liver tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We previously showed that blockade of the PD-1 pathway increases HIV-1-associated T cell function in vitro. However, the effect of PD-1 blockade on HIV-1 disease progression in vivo has not been examined. As in humans, HIV-1-infected humanized BALB/c-Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) (Rag-hu) mice express elevated levels of PD-1 on T cells during chronic infection. To examine the effect of PD-1 blockade on disease progression, Rag-hu mice with chronic HIV-1 infection were treated with a blocking mAb directed against programmed cell death-1 ligand-1, the ligand for PD-1. Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1-treated Rag-hu mice exhibited a progressive decrease in the HIV-1 plasma viral load, with a 7-fold decrease by day 7, a 20-fold decrease by day 14, a 178-fold decrease by day 21, and a 269-fold decrease by day 28 postinitiation of treatment. By day 7, the percentage of CD4(+) T cells was statistically higher in the treated compared with the untreated group, and this trend was sustained throughout the 28-d treatment period. Moreover, there was a strong inverse correlation between plasma viral load and the percentage of both CD4(+) (r = -0.66; p < 0.0001) and CD8(+) (r = -0.64; p < 0.0001) T cells in the treated mice but not the untreated mice.

Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."

We determined rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc seropositivity in asymptomatic, healthy children (n = 181) and adults (n = 354) presenting to referral facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tested a separate group of HBsAg-positive patients (n = 180) for prevalence of HDV. Testing of serum was also performed for signs of liver disease. Overall, seropositivity of HBsAg and anti-HBc in studied subjects was 3 per cent (16/534) and 21.1 per cent (113/534), respectively. Prevalence of HBsAg was highest in the 5- to 9-year-old (8.5 per cent, 7/82) and 10- to 14-year-old (5.9 per cent, 2/34) age groups. Unlike HBsAg, prevalence of anti-HBc was lower in children (14.9 per cent in those below the age of 15) than adults (24.4 per cent in those aged 20-34 years) (p < 0.05). Most HBsAg-positive individuals were symptomatic (n = 125, 69.4 per cent). A high rate (24.4 per cent, 44/180) of simultaneous infection with HDV was observed among HBsAg-positive subjects, with higher rates in older individuals. Anti-HDV seropositivity rate was similar among asymptomatic (21.8 per cent, 12/55) and symptomatic (25.6 per cent, 32/125) HBsAg carriers. Our data suggest that Bangladesh is of moderate endemicity for HBV infection, and has relatively high rates of co-infection with HDV. Control HBV and HDV infection in Bangladesh may be best achieved by targeting preschool children, which could fit readily within the existing EPI schedule."

Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."

Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections.

Treatment for HCV infection includes ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or pegylated IFN, a combination treatment associated with anemia that may require RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. IFN-RBV-associated anemia is more profound among coinfected patients, who have a high prevalence of pretreatment anemia and may also be taking other medications causing anemia. Epoetin alfa administration to HCV-infected patients with IFN-RBV-related anemia can significantly increase hemoglobin levels and maintain significantly higher RBV doses compared with patients treated with RBV dose reduction alone. Higher RBV doses and adherence to HCV therapy have been associated with higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Maintenance of RBV dose with epoetin alfa may improve adherence, thereby affecting SVR."

In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."

The present study was designed to investigate the differential expression patterns of ISG20 in liver biopsy samples from treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B and non-HBV infected controls and to determine the relation between the differential expression and IFN-α treatment outcome (responders vs. non-responders). HBV infection status was determined by measuring levels of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) by chemoluminescence immunoassay and of HBV DNA by real-time quantitative (q)PCR. ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR, respectively. Chronic hepatitis B responders showed significantly higher levels of ISG20 protein and mRNA expressions than either the chronic hepatitis B non-responders or the controls. Moreover, increased expression of ISG20 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm was correlated with positive response to IFN-α treatment. Thus, active transcription and translation of ISG20 may represent a marker to identify chronic hepatitis B patients likely to respond to IFN-α therapy. Prognostic clinical strategies based upon this marker may include genomic screening methods and immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies."

However, some quantitative studies did not find high infection frequencies in peripheral blood monocytes. Since lymphoid organs are the major site of infection, macrophage infection was tested in spleens removed from HIV+ patients for treatment of different syndromes. Ten replicates of limiting dilutions from different cell populations were submitted to a nested PCR specific to conserved regions of HIV1 env DNA. On an average, 1/2,300 adherent cells carried HIV1 DNA (n = 7; range: 1/55,000 to 1/660). These adherent cells, obtained after two days of culture, comprised the whole macrophage population, with no biases introduced by surface molecule selection, but were not pure (41-78% macrophages). Only 1/37,000 CD14+ monocyte/macrophages were positive (n = 6; range: 1/130,000 to 1/22,000). Therefore, the infection frequency of the isolated splenic monocytes/macrophages from these patients could be estimated at between 1/37,000 and 1/2,300. In contrast, 1/60 CD4+ T lymphocytes were positive (n = 7; range: 1/190 to 1/17). Within the experimental limits, such as cell isolation, required for accurate quantification, this study in the spleen indicates, as have other studies on peripheral blood, that macrophages do not quantitatively constitute an important reservoir of HIV when compared to CD4+ T lymphocytes."

Characteristic of the cellular immune response after the VLP booster immunization were high numbers of SIV-specific, gamma interferon-secreting cells after stimulation with inactivated SIV particles, but not SIV peptides, and the absence of detectable levels of CD8(+) T cell responses. Antibodies specific to SIV Gag and SIV Env could be induced in all animals, but, consistent with a poor neutralizing activity at the time of challenge, vaccinated monkeys were not protected from acquisition of infection and did not control viremia. Surprisingly, vaccinees with high numbers of SIV-specific, gamma interferon-secreting cells were infected fastest during the repeated low-dose exposures and the numbers of these immune cells in vaccinated macaques correlated with susceptibility to infection. Thus, in the absence of protective antibodies or cytotoxic T cell responses, vaccine-induced immune responses may increase the susceptibility to acquisition of immunodeficiency virus infection. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that virus-specific T helper cells mediate this detrimental effect and contribute to the inefficacy of past HIV vaccination attempts (e.g., STEP study)."

Among the 23 contacts studied, 7 were seropositive and 16 were seronegative on repeated tests. None of the 16 seronegative contacts were positive for p24 antigenemia nor were they positive by the lymphocytes coculture assay, although, in two instances HIV-1 DNA could be detected by PCR (in one case using a gag SK 38/39 primer, and in the other using a primer for the pol P3/P4 primer). These two individuals remained seronegative for 18 and 36 mo, respectively. HIV-specific cytotoxicity was performed in the 15 HLA-A2.1 subjects (7 indexes, 2 seropositive contacts, and 6 seronegative contacts) and in 4 HLA-matched HIV negative donors. CTL specific for env, gag, or nef proteins could not be detected in unstimulated bulk cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes in any of the six seronegative contacts. However, using a limiting dilution assay we found an usually high frequency of HIV nef-specific CTL precursors (CTLp) for HIV env and gag was very similar to that observed in seronegative HLA-matched healthy donors. Because no presence of HIV could be demonstrated in these individuals, these findings argue against the possibility of a silent HIV infection and suggest that a CTL response against nef may be involved in a rapid and effective clearance of the virus after sexual exposure."

The fate of methylated Tat is unknown, so it is unclear whether methylated Tat is degraded or persists in the cell for additional functions. Here we show that the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 increases Tat protein half-life by 4.7-fold. Tat stabilization depends on the catalytic activity of PRMT6 and requires arginine methylation within the Tat basic domain. In contrast, HIV-1 Rev, which is also methylated by PRMT6, is completely refractory to the stabilizing effect. Proteasome inhibition and silencing experiments demonstrated that Tat can be degraded by a REGgamma-independent proteasome, against which PRMT6 appears to act to increase Tat half-life. Our data reveal a proteasome-dependent Tat degradation pathway that is inhibited by arginine methylation. The stabilizing action of PRMT6 could allow Tat to persist within the cell and the extracellular environment and thereby enable functions implicated in AIDS-related cancer, neurodegeneration, and T-cell death."

Surface CD4 protein was detected on these cells, and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) blocked infection, indicating that HIV infection was mediated by the cell surface CD4 protein. In contrast, infection of human primary chondrocyte cells (C23), synovial cells (HSA), and foreskin fibroblasts (F13) was apparently independent of cell CD4-mediated mechanisms. Surface CD4 protein could not be detected on these cells, and sCD4 did not block the infection. F13 cells could be infected only by HIV-2, not by HIV-1, under our experimental conditions. In cells of mesenchymal orgin, viral production could be detected only after cocultivation with the human T-lymphoid H9 cells but not by conventional viral assays, including reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen assays in cell culture supernatant and immunofluorescence of host cells. Our DNA transfection studies indicated that this lack of detectable viral production was not due to the inefficient use of the HIV long terminal repeat or the Tat protein in these cells. These mesenchymal and epithelial cells were susceptible to HIV infection but differed in mechanism of virus entry compared with hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes. These observations may provide insights into clinical syndromes such as lung dysfunction in HIV-infected newborns and connective tissue disorders in HIV-infected adults."

However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."
438,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Multiple mechanisms are used by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to interfere with host-cell immune effector functions. The 27-kD Nef protein has been shown to down-modulate specific genes of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) on the surface of infected primary T cells, facilitating their escape from lysis by cytolytic T lymphocytes. Macrophages, as the other major immune cell type targeted by the virus, also contribute to the transmission, persistence, and pathogenesis of HIV-1. Yet, whether Nef modulates MHC-I expression on HIV-infected primary macrophages remains unclear. Currently available infectious HIV-1 molecular clones, which express a reporter gene, only infect T cells and/or do not express Nef. To overcome these limitations, we generated macrophage-tropic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HIV-1 viruses, which express the complete viral genome, and used these to assess the expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 on the surface of productively infected macrophages. The reporter viral genomes were replication-competent and stable, as Nef, p24 antigen, and GFP expression could be detected by immunostaining of infected, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after more than 2 months postinfection. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses of infected macrophages and T cells revealed that although wild-type reporter virus infection induced a statistically significant decrease in the density of surface HLA-A2, down-regulation of HLA-A2 was not seen in cells infected with reporter viruses encoding a frameshift or a single point mutation in Nef at prolines 74P and P80. The impact of Nef on HLA-A2 surface expression in MDM was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. These results suggest that the mechanisms of HLA-A2 down-modulation are similar in primary T cells and macrophages."

In contrast, relatively little is known concerning the interplay between HIV-1 and microglia. Recent findings suggest that, counter-intuitively, HIV-1 infection may extend the lifespan of microglia. We developed a novel cell line model system to confirm and mechanistically study this phenomenon. We found that transduction of a human microglial cell line with an HIV-1 vector results in a powerful cytoprotective effect following apoptotic challenge. This effect was reproduced by ectopic expression of a single virus-encoded protein, Tat. Subsequent studies showed that the pro-survival effects of intracellular Tat could be attributed to activation of the PI-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in the microglial cell line. Furthermore, we found that expression of Tat led to decreased expression of PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI-3-K pathway. Consistent with this, decreased p53 activity and increased E2F activity were observed. Based on these findings, a model of possible regulatory circuits that intracellular Tat and HIV-1 infection engage during the cytoprotective event in microglia has been suggested. We propose that the expression of Tat may enable HIV-1 infected microglia to survive throughout the course of infection, leading to persistent HIV-1 production and infection in the central nervous system."
3433,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The 14-kDa Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) serves multiple functions in the retroviral life cycle, including the enhancement of viral replication in nondividing macrophages, the induction of G2 cell-cycle arrest in proliferating T lymphocytes, and the modulation of HIV-1-induced apoptosis. Extracellular Vpr has been detected in the sera and cerebral spinal fluid of HIV-infected patients. However, it is not known whether such forms of Vpr are biologically active. Vpr contains a carboxy-terminal basic amino acid rich segment stretch that is homologous to domains that mediate the energy- and receptor-independent cellular uptake of polypeptides by a process termed protein transduction. Similar functional protein-transducing domains are present in HIV-1 Tat, herpes simplex virus-1 DNA-binding protein VP22, and the Drosophila antennapedia homeotic transcription factor. We now demonstrate effective transduction of biologically active, synthetic Vpr (sVpr) as well as the Vpr-beta-galactosidase fusion protein. However, in contrast to other transducing proteins, Vpr transduction is not enhanced by protein denaturation, and Vpr's carboxy-terminal basic domain alone is not sufficient for its transduction across biological membranes. In contrast, the full-length Vpr protein effectively transduces a broad array of cells, leading to dose-dependent G2 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Addition of Vpr into the extracellular medium also rescues the replication of Vpr-deficient strains of HIV-1 in human macrophage cultures. Native Vpr may thus be optimized for protein transduction, a feature that might enhance and extend the pathological effects of HIV infection."

Previous studies indicated that p6 plays a critical role in HIV-1 particle budding from virus-expressing HeLa cells. In this study, we performed a detailed mutational analysis of the N terminus of p6 to map the sequences required for efficient virus release. We observed that the highly conserved P-T/S-A-P motif located near the N terminus of p6 is remarkably sensitive to change; even conservative mutations in this sequence imposed profound virus release defects in HeLa cells. In contrast, single and double amino acid substitutions outside the P-T/S-A-P motif had no significant effect on particle release. The introduction of stop codons one or two residues beyond the P-T/S-A-P motif markedly impaired virion release, whereas truncation four residues beyond P-T/S-A-P had no effect on particle production in HeLa cells. By examining the effects of p6 mutation in biological and biochemical analyses and by electron microscopy, we defined the role of p6 in particle release and virus replication in a panel of T-cell and adherent cell lines and in primary lymphocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. We demonstrated that the effects of p6 mutation on virus replication are markedly cell type dependent. Intriguingly, even in T-cell lines and primary lymphocytes in which p6 mutations block virus replication, these changes had little or no effect on particle release. However, p6-mutant particles produced in T-cell lines and primary lymphocytes exhibited a defect in virion-virion detachment, resulting in the production of tethered chains of virions. Virus release in monocyte-derived macrophages was markedly inhibited by p6 mutation. To examine further the cell type-specific virus release defect in HeLa versus T cells, transient heterokaryons were produced between HeLa cells and the Jurkat T-cell line. These heterokaryons display a T-cell-like phenotype with respect to the requirement for p6 in particle release. The results described here define the role of p6 in virus replication in a wide range of cell types and reveal a strong cell type-dependent requirement for p6 in virus particle budding."

Indeed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of many nonhuman primate cells is inhibited by one such factor, termed Lv1. In contrast, a restriction factor in humans, termed Ref1, does not inhibit HIV-1 infection unless nonnatural mutations are introduced into the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA). Here, we examined the infectivity of a panel of mutant HIV-1 strains carrying substitutions in the N-terminal CA domain in cells that exhibit restriction attributable to Lv1 or Ref1. Manipulation of HIV-1 CA could alter HIV-1 tropism, and several mutations were identified that increased or decreased HIV-1 infectivity in a target-cell-specific manner. Many residues that affected HIV-1 tropism were located in the three variable loops that lie on the outer surface of the modeled HIV-1 conical capsid. Some tropism determinants, including the CypA binding site, coincided with residues whose mutation conferred on HIV-1 CA the ability to saturate Ref1 in human cells. Notably, a mutation that reverses the infectivity defect in human cells induced by CypA binding site mutation inhibits recognition by Ref1. Overall, these findings demonstrate that exposed variable loops in CA and a partial CypA ""coat"" can modulate restriction and HIV-1 tropism and suggest a model in which the exposed surface of the incoming retroviral capsid is the target for inhibition by host cell-specific restriction factors."

No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."

However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."

CD4 T lymphocyte counts and all virologic parameters examined remained unchanged regardless of zidovudine treatment status. Histopathology and virus distribution within lymph nodes remained constant between baseline and week 8 in each patient, indicating that the virologic and histologic parameters examined in a single lymph node are representative of a systemic process.

Although the plasma virus load was similar throughout, the order and timing of appearance of resistance-associated substitutions differed in the two patients. In patient p74, K70R appeared after 4 months, T215Y at 5.5 months, and M41L at 13 months. In p87, K70R also appeared at 4 months, but T215Y and K219Q were not observed until 18 months and M41L not at all. Much greater sequence change overall occurred in p74. The evolution of the viral population in that patient was dominated by the unique appearance of T215Y and subsequently M41L, with all sequences from the last time point being descended by a single path from the pretreatment samples. However, in p87, several different lineages of RT sequences were found to persist throughout treatment.

However, the value of adoptive transfer of HIV-specific CTL expanded in vitro to HIV+ patients has been limited: this contrasts with the success of CTL therapy in treating or preventing Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus disease after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We investigated the fate of expanded HIV-specific CTL clones in vivo following adoptive transfer to a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two autologous CTL clones specific for HIV Gag and Pol were expanded to large numbers (>10(9)) in vitro and infused into an HIV-infected patient whose viral load was rising despite antiretroviral therapy. The fate of one clone was monitored by staining peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with T-cell receptor-specific tetrameric major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes. Although the CTL transfer was well tolerated, there were no significant changes in CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts and virus load. By tracking an infused clone using soluble MHC-peptide complexes, we show that cells bearing the Gag-specific T-cell receptors were rapidly eliminated within hours of infusion through apoptosis. Thus, the failure of adoptively transferred HIV-specific CTL to reduce virus load in AIDS may be due to rapid apoptosis of the infused cells, triggered by a number of potential mechanisms. Further trials of adoptive transfer of CTL should take into account the susceptibility of infused cells to in vivo apoptosis."

For HTLV-II, large numbers of infected lymphocytes might contribute to accelerate the immunodeficiency and increase the risk of neuropathy in HTLV-II/HIV-1 coinfected people. We have examined the impact of antiretroviral drugs on HTLV proviral load, testing longitudinal samples collected from 1 HTLV-I infected patient suffering HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM), and two HTLV-II/ HIV-1 coinfected subjects. The HAM patient showed a reduction greater than 2 log in the peripheral proviral load after being treated with zidovudine and lamivudine. In contrast, potent antiretroviral treatment in HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfected carriers produced an initial increase in the HTLV proviral load, which was followed by a reduction greater than 1 log thereafter. In conclusion, antiretroviral drugs seem to reduce HTLV proviral load, although in HIV-1 coinfected persons a transient increase in HTLV proviral load could reflect the rapid blocking of HIV-1 replication occurring in response to therapy, thus causing an increase in the number of circulating T lymphocytes carrying HTLV proviral DNA."

HAART were modified four times for toxicity and one time for virological failure. We observed two cases of transient renal insufficiency, two cases of diabetes, two cases of pancreatitis, and abnormalities of the respiratory mitochondrial chain in four patients. Finally, liver transplantation in HIV-HCV co-infected patients seems to be feasible when strict criteria of selection are taken into account. This still experimental strategy requires a multidisciplinary partnership."

Their stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB, an important inducer of HIV-1 replication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies using several cells types from HIV-infected patients indicate that TLRs play a key role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the effect of HIV-1 stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from healthy donors on the expression and functions of TLR2 and TLR4 was examined. In addition, and to complete the in vitro study, the expression pattern of TLR2 and TLR4 in 49 HIV-1-infected patients, classified according to viral load and the use of HAART, was determined and compared with 25 healthy subjects. An increase of TLR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in MDMs and PBMCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and in response to TLR stimulation, compared to the mock. In addition, an association between TLR expression and up-regulation of CD80 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was observed. The ex vivo analysis indicated increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), but only of TLR2 in monocytes obtained from HIV-1-infected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Remarkably, the expression was higher in cells from patients who do not use HAART. In monocytes, there was a positive correlation between both TLRs and viral load, but not CD4(+) T cell numbers. Together, our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that TLR expression and function can be up-regulated in response to HIV-1 infection and could affect the inflammatory response. We propose that modulation of TLRs represents a mechanism to promote HIV-1 replication or AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients."

However, the ability of HIV-1 to develop resistance to multiple classes continues to present challenges to the treatment of many ARV treatment-experienced patients. In this case report, we describe the response to ibalizumab, an investigational CD4-binding monoclonal antibody (mAb), in a patient with advanced immunodeficiency and high-level five-class antiretroviral resistance. After starting an ibalizumab-based salvage regimen, the patient had an approximately 4.0 log(10) reduction in viral load. An inadvertently missed infusion at week 32 led to the rapid loss of virologic response and decreased susceptibility to the remainder of the patient's salvage therapy regimen. Following the reinstitution of ibalizumab, phenotypic and genotypic resistance to ibalizumab was detected. Nonetheless, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels stabilized at ∼2.0 log(10) copies/ml below pre-ibalizumab levels. Continued ARV drug development may yield additional clinical and public health benefits. This report illustrates the promise of mAbs for HIV-1 therapy in highly treatment-experienced patients. Therapeutic mAbs may also have a role in pre-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk uninfected populations and may facilitate directly observed therapy (DOT) if two or more synergistic long acting agents become available."

We report a child whose first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was nephropathy and wasting syndrome associated with profound immunodeficiency. The patient had a dramatic clinical and immunologic response to triple antiretroviral therapy delivered through a gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of nephrotic syndrome. A 51/2-year-old African-American girl presented with a 2-week history of cough, chest pain, vomiting, loose stools, abdominal distention, anorexia, and fever. In addition, she had recurrent oral thrush. Her weight and height were below the 5th percentile. She was chronically ill, appearing with oropharyngeal thrush and pitting edema in lower extremities. She had scattered rhonchi and decreased breath sounds on both lung bases. Her abdomen was distended and diffusely tender. A chest radiograph showed consolidation of the right upper and left lower lobes with bilateral pleural effusion. Admission laboratories were consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Streptococcus pneumoniae grew from the blood culture and the child responded well to treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone. She was found to be HIV-infected, her CD4(+) cell count was 3 cells/mcL and her plasma HIV-1 RNA was >750 000 copies/mL. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed for supplemental nutrition. She was treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir via gastrostomy tube with good clinical response. Twenty-one months after instituting antiretroviral therapy, her weight and height had increased to the 50th and 10th percentile respectively, and she had complete resolution of her nephrotic syndrome. Her CD4(+) cell count increased to 1116 cells/mcL and her viral load has remained undetectable. HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been described in children with profound immunodeficiency. The course of untreated HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome is rapid progression to renal failure in up to 40% of the children. Regardless of the presence of renal insufficiency, if untreated, it is uniformly fatal. A modest improvement of HIV-1 associated nephrotic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with zidovudine. Steroid and cyclosporine treatment have resulted in improved renal function but long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy has raised concerns about safety. We have described, to our knowledge, the first child with HIV-associated nephrotic syndrome who had a remarkable clinical, immunologic, and virologic response to triple-drug combination therapy given by gastrostomy tube, with complete resolution of proteinuria and normalization of the serum albumin. She also had a striking improvement in weight, height, and quality-of-life. Whether the presence of a gastrostomy tube contributed to the excellent response because of improved compliance is unknown, but warrants systematic evaluation."

We describe two cases of multiple intestinal perforations secondary to MTB in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presenting at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center over a 2-month period. For each case, this was the first presentation of AIDS. One of the two patients had concurrent pulmonary involvement. One patient died, and the other responded to therapy and was discharged in stable condition. The most striking finding in both cases was the extremely large number of acid-fast bacteria seen transmurally on the pathological specimens. This might be related to impaired T-cell function. The resurgence of MTB infection in North America, in the presence of the AIDS epidemic, may result in an increasing frequency of unusual presentations, such as intestinal perforation. Intestinal perforation due to MTB should be considered in HIV-infected patients presenting with an acute abdomen."

The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."

Subtype C predominates in sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for the majority of worldwide HIV-1 infections, subtype B predominates in North America and Europe, and subtype E is prevalent in Southeast Asia. Significant amino acid variations have been observed among the clade-specific Tat proteins. For the present study, we examined clade-specific interactions between Tat, transactivation-responsive (TAR) element, and P-TEFb proteins and how these interactions may modulate the efficiency of HIV-1 transcription. Clade-specific Tat proteins significantly modified viral gene expression. Tat proteins derived from HIV-1 clades C and E were strong transactivators of long terminal repeat (LTR) activity; Tat E also had a longer half-life than the other Tat proteins and interacted more efficiently with the stem-loop TAR element. Chimeric Tat proteins harboring the Tat E activation domain were strong transactivators of LTR expression. While Tat B, C, and E were able to rescue a Tat-defective HIV-1 proviral clone, Tat E was significantly more efficient at rescue than Tat C, possibly due to the relative stability of the Tat protein. Swapping the activation domains of Tat B, C, and E identified the cyclin T1 association domain as a critical determinant of the transactivation efficiency and of Tat-defective HIV-1 provirus rescue."

The authors searched state Medicaid Web sites between 23 June and 7 December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on whether sofosbuvir was covered and the criteria for coverage based on the following categories: liver disease stage, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use. Of the 42 states with known Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir, 74% limit sofosbuvir access to persons with advanced fibrosis (Meta-Analysis of Histologic Data in Viral Hepatitis [METAVIR] fibrosis stage F3) or cirrhosis (F4). One quarter of states require persons co-infected with HCV and HIV to be receiving antiretroviral therapy or to have suppressed HIV RNA levels. Two thirds of states have restrictions based on prescriber type, and 88% include drug or alcohol use in their sofosbuvir eligibility criteria, with 50% requiring a period of abstinence and 64% requiring urine drug screening. Heterogeneity is present in Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir with respect to liver disease staging, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use across the United States. Restrictions do not seem to conform with recommendations from professional organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group.

New insights have revealed multiple mechanisms by which HCV and HIV lead to accelerated disease progression, specifically that HIV infection increases HCV replication, augments HCV-induced hepatic inflammation, increases hepatocyte apoptosis, increases microbial translocation from the gut and leads to an impairment of HCV-specific immune responses. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy and treatment of HCV have independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients. However, rates of sustained virologic response with PEG-IFN and ribavirin have been significantly inferior among co-infected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, and treatment uptake has remained low given the limited efficacy and tolerability of current HCV regimens. With multiple direct-acting antiviral agents in development to treat HCV, a unique opportunity exists to redefine the treatment paradigm for co-infected patients, which incorporates data on fibrosis stage as well as potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy.

As for the control group, 24 HIV-negative subjects were enrolled. c-IMT was assessed by ultrasound. CD4+/CD8+ T-cell activation (CD38+ HLADR+) and senescence (CD57+ CD28-) were measured by flow cytometry. IL-6 and OPG levels were measured by ELISA kit. c-IMT was higher in HIV+ than in controls. Among HIV+ patients, 44.7% had pathological c-IMT (≥0.9 mm). CD8+ T-cell activation and senescence and OPG plasma levels were higher in HIV+ patients than in controls. Subjects with pathological c-IMT exhibited higher CD8+ immune activation and immunosenescence and OPG levels than subjects with normal c-IMT. Multivariate analysis showed that age, CD8+ CD38+ HLADR+, and CD8+ CD28- CD57+ were independently associated with pathological c-IMT. Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in HIV patients.

To define mechanisms of thymocyte infection, we examined human thymocytes for expression and function of CXCR4 and CCR5, the major cell entry coreceptors for T cell line-tropic (T-tropic) and macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, respectively. CXCR4 was detected on the surface of all thymocytes. CXCR4 expression on mature, high level TCR thymocytes was similar to that on peripheral blood T cells, but was much lower than that on immature thymocytes, including CD34+ thymic progenitors. Consistent with this, stroma-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) induced calcium flux primarily in immature thymocytes, with CD34+ progenitors giving the strongest response. In addition, SDF-1 mRNA was detected in thymic-derived stromal cells, and SDF-1 induced chemotaxis of thymocytes, suggesting that CXCR4 may play a role in thymocyte migration. Infection of immature thymocytes by the T-tropic HIV-1 strain LAI was 10-fold more efficient than that in mature thymocytes, consistent with their relative CXCR4 surface expression. Anti-CXCR4 antiserum or SDF-1 blocked fusion of thymocytes with cells expressing the LAI envelope. In contrast to CXCR4, CCR5 was detected at low levels on thymocytes, and CCR5 agonists did not induce calcium flux or chemotaxis in thymocytes. However, CD4+ mature thymocytes were productively infected with the CCR5-tropic strain Ba-L, and this infection was specifically inhibited with the CCR5 agonist, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta. Our data provide strong evidence that CXCR4 and CCR5 function as coreceptors for HIV-1 infection of human thymocytes."

It is believed that HCV is a non-cytopathic virus and that T-cell-mediated events (including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines) have an important role in promoting both liver damage and viral clearance. Whether HIV coinfection or antiretroviral therapies influence such events is still unclear. In the current study, we compared the expression of NKp46 (a natural killer cell marker), CD3 (a T-cell marker), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; pro-inflammatory cytokines) and interleukin-10 (IL-10; an anti-inflammatory cytokine) mRNA in the liver of naive HIV/HCV-coinfected patients (group one, n=14), coinfected patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (group two, n=23) and naive HCV mono-infected patients (group three, n=24). All three groups had comparable HCV viremia, with coinfected patients showing similar and relatively high CD4+ T-cell counts and significantly different HIV vireamia. Interestingly, when compared to groups two and three, group one showed significantly higher intrahepatic mRNA levels for CD3, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, whereas the expression of NKp46 and IL-10 were comparable in all three groups. Further, higher histopathological grading scores within each group were independently associated with higher mRNA contents for CD3 and IFN-gamma and higher serum alanine aminotransferase levels at the time of liver biopsy. Together, these results suggest that HIV infection may exacerbate the immune-mediated inflammatory response in the liver of patients chronically infected with HCV and antiretroviral therapy may prevent this effect."

Drug resistance genotyping was performed on virus present in blood samples collected from individuals with serologically confirmed primary infection, between 1996 and 2007. The significance of any mutations detected was interpreted according to a standardised list of drug resistance mutations. The main outcomes measured were the prevalence by year of TDR to any antiretroviral drug class, the numbers of infected individuals with TDR involving multiple drug classes, and the resistance mutations implicated in all cases. There was an average annual prevalence of TDR of 16%, predominantly associated with nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors and most commonly occurring at codons 41, 103 and 215 in the RT. The prevalence of thymidine-associated mutations remained high throughout the period of study. While mutations known to cause resistance to protease inhibitors were uncommon, they were present in several individuals infected with virus resistant to multiple drug classes. The prevalence of TDR in Victoria is similar to geographical locations outside Australia where HIV-specific drug treatment is widely available. Primary infection with drug resistant HIV is a future treatment issue for the individual patient and for the wider population at risk of infection. At this time TDR shows no sign of waning and our data support recent treatment guidelines recommending baseline testing for TDR before therapy is initiated."

Modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) with weekly administration of pegylated interferon might improve adherence and outcomes for patients infected with chronic HCV. The purpose of this study was to compare two treatment protocols and examine predictors of sustained virologic response (SVR). This retrospective review compares HCV treatment outcomes in two outpatient clinics at an urban academic medical center. Gastroenterology fellows provided standard treatment (SC) in one clinic; a nurse practitioner administered weekly pegylated interferon injections weekly in a primary care clinic. All patients received oral ribavirin. Data was extracted from the medical records of all treated patients over a 5-year period. 155 treatment-naïve, chronically infected HCV patients were treated. Ninety-seven patients received mDOT treatment and 58 received standard care. Mean age was 46 years. Genotype 1 represented 59 % of the sample. The mDOT patients were significantly more likely to be younger (44 vs. 50 years), have a history of injection drug use (93.1 vs. 50.0 %), and be HIV-infected (13.5 vs. 2 %) compared to SC patients. The overall SVR rate was 45.2 % and did not differ between the groups in unadjusted analyses (p = 0.95). Genotype was the only predictor of SVR.

Children aged 2 to 12 years were randomized to receive twice-daily doses of 0.35, 1.5, or 4 mg of lamivudine solution per kg of body weight or once-daily doses of 3 mg of lamivudine solution per kg. Adolescents aged 13 to 17 years received lamivudine at 100 mg (as tablets). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assay were taken on days 1 and 28. Lamivudine was rapidly absorbed following oral administration, with the maximum concentration in serum being reached 0.5 to 1 h postdosing. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was higher in younger children and decreased with age, with CL/F values for adolescents reaching those seen for adults by the age of 12. All doses produced a dramatic fall in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels, with a median reduction of >/=99.5% after 4 weeks of treatment and with the levels returning to the baseline levels posttreatment. The correlation of dose, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and changes in HBV DNA levels, as measured by the Chiron Quantiplex assay, showed maximal antiviral effects (99.9% inhibition and a reduction of the amount of HBV DNA of approximately 3 log(10)) at 3 mg/kg/day, with no discernible increase in effect seen whether the drug was given at 4 mg/kg twice daily or whether it was given once daily or twice daily. The limit of detection of the assay (2.5 pg/ml) was reached for some but not all patients across the dose ranges, with the smallest number (n = 2) of those having values negative by the Chiron Quantiplex assay being in the lowest-dose group. The 13- to 17-year-olds showed a similar overall response in terms of the HBV DNA level reduction compared to that for patients younger than age 13. Analysis of the same samples by PCR, which has a lower limit of sensitivity than the Chiron Quantiplex assay, also showed average drops in HBV DNA levels of about 3 log(10) at 4 weeks for patients for which the AUC was >/=4,000 ng. h/ml, confirming the conclusions given above. Lamivudine treatment was well tolerated at all doses, with no significant adverse events or laboratory data changes. On the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, a 3-mg/kg/day dose in children (ages 2 to 12 years) with chronic hepatitis B provides levels of exposure and trough concentrations similar to those seen in adults following the receipt of doses of 100 mg. The 100-mg dose is being evaluated in a large phase III study with HBV-infected pediatric patients."

The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

However, its impact on spontaneous clearance of HBV (the pathogenesis of which is also related to interferon) is less known. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 49 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg(+) for more than 6 months) who had been genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP (protective CC genotype). One control for each case was chosen among HIV patients with anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Controls were matched for gender and coinfection with HCV. Most patients were male (90%) and the median (IQR) age was 42.6 (39-46.7) years. Eighteen (36.7%) were also coinfected by HCV. Among HBsAg(+) patients, 19 (41.3%) were HBeAg(+) and 13 (26.5%) were also infected with hepatitis delta (HDV). No differences were found in the distribution of the CC genotype between patients with chronic hepatitis B and those who spontaneously cured hepatitis B: 59.2% vs. 44.9%; p=0.3. Thus, the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype does not seem to have a role in the development of chronic hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients."

A total of 418 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who attended the out patient departments of Harar Tuberculosis Centre and two general hospitals were studied from October 1994 through January 1995. The majority (94%) of these patients were from the tuberculosis centre. Sputum cultures were positive for 338/418 (80.9%) patients. HIV seroprevalence was 92/418 (22.0%) among smear positive and 69/338 (20.4%) among culture positive patients. HIV positive patients were more likely to be from urban than rural areas (p < 0.001). Initial resistance was not affected by HIV seropositivity. Secondary drug resistance was significantly higher in HIV positive patients than HIV negatives (p < 0.05). Although not significant, HIV positive patients were more defaulters than HIV negatives. Significantly higher numbers of HIV positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were cases of relapse and treatment failure (p < 0.05). Other studies are required in order to assess the impact of HIV infection on the spread of anti-tuberculosis resistance.

Candidate vaccines against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) should elicit broad cross-reactive immunity to confer protection against different strains of HIV-1. As it is likely that candidate vaccines will include the envelope gene product Env, we determined the proportion of CTL clones which recognized variable and conserved determinants in three env variants during natural infection. Limiting dilution analysis was used to characterize numerous short-term CTL clones derived from peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected subjects, using split-well analysis to assay cytotoxicity against target cells expressing gp160env of HIV-1 strains IIIB, MN, and RF. In 9 of 12 HIV-1-infected subjects, at the clonal level most env-specific CTL recognized determinant(s) within one env variant but not in the other variants. In some subjects, CTL recognized multiple nonconserved determinants in different variants. The pattern of recognition of different env variants was relatively stable over time. In most of the patients studied, the proportion of CTL which showed cross-recognition of conserved determinants shared among the three strains was low. Two novel CTL epitopes within gp41 were identified by using 15-mer peptides of the HIV-SF2 sequence. When specific peptide was used to stimulate CTL precursors in vitro, the frequency of peptide-specific CTL precursors was very high, but the CTL elicited by this stimulation were highly strain specific. We conclude that the use of a single HIV env variant to detect CTL activity can underestimate the magnitude and complexity of the env-specific CTL response. The low prevalence of CTL clones which show cross-recognition of conserved determinants may have implications for immunization strategies based solely on env; to elicit broadly cross-reactive CTL other, more conserved viral antigens are likely to be needed in addition to env. Because of its capacity to distinguish CTL responses against different virus strains, limiting dilution analysis is particularly appropriate to quantitate the immune responses generated by candidate env-based vaccines."

Twenty-eight infectious disease hospital units in Italy participated in this observational, multicentre, prospective cohort study. A number of HIV-infected subjects, (n=1,705) seen for the first time as outpatients, were included in this analysis. Of the subjects considered, 1,215 out of the 1,705 completed purified protein derivative (PPD) screening. Variables independently associated with offering and completion of PPD screening included having acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), higher educational levels and currently receiving therapy. Overall, 103 subjects were identified as candidates for IPT. Of these subjects, five had tuberculosis and 15 had contraindications to IPT. Forty subjects agreed to start IPT, and 29 completed a full-course regimen. The incidence of tuberculosis among IPT candidates who either did not begin or discontinued IPT was 6.1 per 100 person-yrs, while no cases of tuberculosis were observed in subjects completing IPT. Several factors may limit the implementation of an isoniazid preventive therapy programme for human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons. Physicians fail to offer purified protein derivative screening to patients with high degrees of immunodeficiency, and those with a more intense workload seem to pay less attention to this test. The high number of contraindications among patients and their low level of acceptance further affects the impact of isoniazid preventive therapy."

To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."

This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

It has led to a decrease of viral load and a quantitative and qualitative improvement of immune function in patients, especially CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, having as a consequence a decrease of infectious complications and a global clinical improvement. Besides the positive effects of HAARTs on immune and metabolic alterations during HIV infection, it has been reported that the commonly used drugs AZT, ddI, and ddC are toxic to hepatocytes. Recent reports continue to point to the mitochondria as targets for toxicity. The prevalence of these symptoms is continued during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The effects of oxidative stress occurring as a consequence of mitochondrial toxicity may amplify some of the pathophysiological and phenotypic events during infection. Mitochondrial stabilisation and antioxidative strategies are possible new therapeutic aims since the antiretroviral treatment is prolonged with increased longevity from AIDS, which has become a more manageable chronic illness. The aim of the present review article is to summarize the current knowledge about mitochondrial dysfunction during HAART and its consequence for patients with chronic treatment. Oxidative stress may serve as one pathway for cellular damage in AIDS and its treatment. One important future goal is to prevent or attenuate the side effects of HAART so that improved disease management can be achieved."

We therefore audited screening practices and clinical outcomes in patients prescribed rituximab since its introduction in a large metropolitan health service. All patients receiving rituximab over an 88-month period were identified via pharmacy records. Medical records and laboratory results were reviewed to determine the timing and type of hepatitis screening. HBV flares were identified and correlated with clinical outcomes and any screening or prophylaxis given. Rituximab was given to 355 patients over 88 months (average age, 61 years; 51% male, 48% born overseas); 83% received rituximab for treatment of a hematological malignancy. HBV screening occurred in 31% of patients and, of these, 66% had pre-emptive screening. Five patients given cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab experienced HBV flares. Four died from viral reactivation. None received antiviral prophylaxis. Hepatitis screening rates in patients receiving rituximab in this study were lower than recommended in clinical guidelines. The identification of five patients with clinically important flares and four deaths in this group highlight the critical need to identify at-risk patients and provide timely prophylactic antiviral therapy to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. Even those with evidence of HBV seroconversion are at risk for fatal flares without active prophylactic antiviral therapy."

We studied the effect of current standard therapy (2 nucleoside analogues and a protease inhibitor) in 16 patients with symptomatic PHI. In the 13 patients who completed 1 year of treatment, plasma HIV RNA was <50 copies/mL and median CD4 cell counts were comparable to HIV-uninfected controls, with naive (CD45RA+CD62L+), primed (CD45RO+), and T cell receptor Vbeta subsets all within normal ranges. However, HIV-1 DNA levels in treated and untreated PHI patients were similar. Furthermore, CD8 cell counts remained elevated, including activated (CD38+HLA-DR+), replicating (Ki-67+), and cytotoxic (perforin+CD28-) lymphocytes. In conclusion, early antiretroviral therapy resulted in clearance of viremia and prevented loss of crucial CD4 subsets. The persistence of HIV-1 DNA together with increased CD8 T lymphocyte turnover and activation indicate continued expression of viral antigens."

This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. Entecavir 1 mg/day was more effective than adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg/day in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, according to the results of a randomized, open-label, multicentre trial. Patients were either nucleos(t)ide naive or lamivudine experienced. The reduction from baseline in HBV DNA levels at week 24 (primary endpoint) was significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil. The proportion of patients with HBV DNA levels of <300 copies/mL was also significantly greater with entecavir than with adefovir dipivoxil at weeks 24, 48 and 96, as was the proportion of patients with ALT normalization. Entecavir 0.5 or 1 mg/day, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg/day and a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200 mg/300 mg per day were effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease, according to the 48-week analysis of a randomized, double-blind, multicentre trial, primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints. In this trial, over one-third of patients had received previous therapy with lamivudine for ≥6 months. The efficacy of entecavir in treatment-naive patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis did not significantly differ from that seen in patients with chronic hepatitis B or compensated cirrhosis (compensated group), according to the results of a prospective, nonrandomized study. After 6 or 12 months of entecavir treatment, there were no significant differences between the decompensated and compensated groups in virological, biochemical or serological endpoints. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, significant improvements from baseline in liver function were seen after 12 months of entecavir therapy. Oral entecavir was generally well tolerated in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease, with most of the reported treatment-emergent adverse events consistent with decompensated liver disease. In the trial primarily designed to examine tolerability endpoints, there was no significant difference between patients receiving entecavir and those receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with or without emtricitabine in terms of the proportion of patients experiencing tolerability failure or the proportion of patients with confirmed increases in serum creatinine levels of ≥0.5 mg/dL above baseline or confirmed serum phosphorus levels of <2.0 mg/dL at week 48 (co-primary endpoints). It has been suggested that the risk of lactic acidosis associated with oral nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy is increased in patients with highly impaired liver function. However, only one case of lactic acidosis was reported among entecavir recipients across two clinical trials in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease. Moreover, small studies found that the risk of lactic acidosis was not increased in patients with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease who received entecavir, compared with patients with non-HBV decompensated liver disease. In conclusion, entecavir is a valuable agent for the first-line treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients with decompensated liver disease."

Of the nearly two million people infected with HIV-1, approximately 11% have platelet counts of less than 100,000/mm3. If no etiology other than HIV-1 infection can be found for the thrombocytopenia, the syndrome is referred to as HIV-1-associated thrombocytopenia (HAT). Steroids lead to an improvement in the platelet count in 60% to 80% of effected individuals but the majority of those who respond cannot maintain a normal platelet count when steroids are withdrawn. Furthermore concern over chronic steroid therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals has led to the investigation of other forms of treatment for this syndrome. This report describes the experience at Duke University Medical Center with eight patients who developed HAT and subsequently underwent splenectomy. In this group there was 1 complete response, 5 partial responses, and 2 patients who did not respond. There were no perioperative deaths and minimal perioperative morbidity. No evidence for the progression of HIV-1 infection in asymptomatic patients after splenectomy to AIDS related complex (ARC) or to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was seen. In addition no increase in the susceptibility to infections by encapsulated organisms as a result of splenectomy was observed after a mean follow-up of 13.25 months. A review of 79 other cases reported in the literature suggests a higher response rate than that observed in our patients. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed and an algorithm defining the role of splenectomy in the management of HAT is presented."

The generation of HCV F protein and PD-1 expression on T cells was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association of rs12979860 CC genotype with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection in our subjects. The generation of HCV F protein was significantly related to HCV infection chronicity, but no significant relationship was found between HCV F protein and SNPs in PD-1. The rs10204525 TT genotype was associated with an increased risk of HCV infection chronicity in age ⩽56years subgroup (adjusted OR=0.390, P=3.8×10(-4)). The C allele of rs10204525 played protective roles in females infected with HCV (adjusted OR=0.608, P=0.008). A significant higher percentage of PD-1 expression on T cells was observed in rs10204525 TT genotype when compared to CC genotype (P=0.047). Moreover, a significant genotype-genotype interaction between IL-28B rs12979860 CC and PD-1 rs10204525 TC+CC was found to be associated with higher rates of spontaneous clearance (adjusted OR=0.689, P=0.032). The combined effect of rs12979860 and rs10204525 was of great value in predicting the outcomes of HCV infection.

In this study sequential viral isolates were analyzed from five patients with prior zidovudine (AZT) use who received 6 to 16 months of ddl therapy. Following ddl therapy, viral isolates exhibited an increased AZT susceptibility and decreased ddl susceptibility. Sequence and nested PCR analysis of the HIV-1 RT gene revealed that two viral isolates contained the Leu to Val change at codon 74, and three other isolates with reduced susceptibility to ddl each contained changes at codons 65, 70, and 72. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to insert specific mutations in RT gene of proviral clone pNL4-3. Analysis of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity indicated that the Lys70Arg mutation resulted in an enzyme with 2- to 4-fold decreased susceptibility to ddATP. Statistical analysis of the inhibitory concentration for RT activity between pNL4-3 and mutant Lys70Arg viruses obtained in three independent RT inhibition assays was significant (P = 0.05) by student t test paired analysis. Drug susceptibility assays on the virus with Lys70Arg mutation showed a marginal decrease in susceptibility to ddl (1.5- to 2-fold) and about 4- to 6-fold decrease in susceptibility to AZT. Mutations Lys65Glu and Arg72Ser resulted in an impaired RT with greatly diminished functional RT activity.

Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains].

The most accurate measure of infectious HIV-1 titers involves a limiting dilution-infection assay and a calculation of the dose required for 50% infectivity of susceptible cells in tissue culture (TCID(50)). Surrogate assays are now commonly used to measure the amount of p24 capsid, the endogenous reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, or the amount of viral genomic RNA in virus particles. However, a direct comparison of these surrogate assays and actual infectious HIV-1 titers from TCID(50) assays has not been performed with even the most conserved laboratory strains, let alone the highly divergent primary HIV-1 isolates of different subtypes. This study indicates that endogenous RT activity, not p24 content or viral RNA load, is the best surrogate measure of infectious HIV-1 titer in both cell-free supernatants and viruses purified on sucrose cushions. Sequence variation between HIV-1 subtypes did not appear to affect the function or activity of the RT enzyme in this endogenous assay but did affect the detection of p24 capsid by both enzyme immunoassays and Western blots. Clear groupings of non-syncytium-inducing (NSI), CCR5-tropic (R5), and SI/CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 isolates were observed when we compared the slopes derived from correlations of RT activity with infectious titers. Finally, the replication efficiency or fitness of both the NSI/R5 and SI/X4 HIV-1 isolates was not linked to the titers of the virus stocks."

This inhibitory effect of cystamine occurred with all five HIV-1 strains (both laboratory adopted and fresh isolates) tested in the study. The addition of cystamine to cultures of HIV-1 chronically infected CBMDM also suppressed 80% to 90% of RT activity in comparison with untreated controls. Cystamine also decreased HIV-1 protein expression in CBMDM as determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The inhibitory effects of cystamine on HIV-1 did not appear to be caused by toxicity to CBMDM or lymphocytes because there was no change in cell viability or cellular DNA synthesis as evaluated by trypan blue dye exclusion and [3H]-thymidine incorporation at doses of cystamine that inhibit the virus. HIV-1 infected CBMDM or lymphocyte cultures (without cystamine treatment) demonstrated giant syncytium formation or cytopathic effect (CPE), respectively, whereas cystamine-treated cultures lacked the giant syncytia or CPE induced by HIV-1 infection. Thus, these observations indicate that cystamine may have the potential to limit HIV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in vivo and may represent a potentially useful compound in the treatment of pediatric HIV-1 infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

Species-specific viral tropism has limited the usefulness of small animal models to study the impact of viral hepatitis. Immunodeficient mice grafted with human hepatocytes are susceptible to hepatitis viruses B, C, D and E (HBV, HCV, HDV and HEV), developing full viral life cycles, and delivering a means to investigate virus-host interactions and antiviral treatments. These chimeric humanized mouse models have been further grafted with humanized immune systems to decipher immune responses following hepatotropic viral infections, the ensuing pathophysiology, and to test novel therapeutic strategies."

Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."

Core components are then restructured to form the reverse transcription complex (RTC); the biochemical details of this process are currently unclear. To investigate early RTC formation, we characterized the endogenous reverse transcription activity of virions, which was less efficient than reverse transcription during cell infection and suggested a requirement for a cell factor. The addition of detergent to virions released reverse transcriptase and capsid, and reverse transcription products became susceptible to the action of exogenous nucleases, indicating virion disruption. Disruption was coincident with the loss of the endogenous reverse transcription activity of virions, particularly late reverse transcription products. Consistent with this observation, the use of a modified ""spin thru"" method, which uses brief detergent exposure, also disrupted virions. The addition of lysates made from mammalian cell lines (Jurkat, HEK293T, and NIH 3T3 cells) to virions delipidated by detergent stimulated late reverse transcription efficiency. A complex with reverse transcription activity that was slower sedimenting than virions on a velocity gradient was greatly stimulated to generate full-length reverse transcription products and was associated with only relatively small amounts of capsid. These experiments suggest that cell factors are required for efficient reverse transcription of HIV-1."
8085,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) invades the central nervous system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50% of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV-1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD4(+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV-1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to purge these viral reservoirs and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS."

Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."

In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."

To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed."

The aim of this work was to describe the clinical characteristics associated with the HBV genotypes circulating in Buenos Aires city. The study included 139 patients infected with HBV, whose clinical courses were classified as acute symptomatic self-limiting hepatitis, inactive carrier state and chronic active hepatitis (HBV e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and HBeAg-negative). The HBV genotypes were determined in 128 patients by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis. Biochemical, virological, clinical and histological features were analysed. A differential distribution of genotypes between acute symptomatic and chronic infections was found. Among the acute cases, genotype F was predominant (65.2%, 30/46) and genotype D was rare (4.3%, 2/46), whereas among the chronic infections, a homogeneous distribution of genotypes A (26.8%, 22/82), D (31.7%, 26/82) and F (36.6%, 30/82), with an unusual presence of genotypes B (1.2%, 1/82) and C (3.7%, 3/82), was observed. Regarding the liver histology of chronically infected patients, genotype F tended to display higher histological activity indexes. Mutations related to HBV surface antigen immunoreactivity, antiviral resistance and HBeAg-negative status were studied. This work constitutes, to our knowledge, the first description of the clinical characteristics related to HBV genotypes in Argentina, where the distribution of genotypes in patients with acute infection has not been reported previously. Finally, it was established that genotype F is the prevalent genotype among the acute symptomatic infections in Buenos Aires city, and that it shows a tendency to cause an adverse disease outcome among the chronic cases."

With increasing knowledge and improved therapeutics the natural history of the infection has been modified. In this paper we aim to present the general socio-demographic profile and the clinical and therapeutic spectrum of patients with HIV infection who have visited the Bayamón Health Care facilities over the last 12 years and who are part of the Retrovirus Research Center (RRC). The objectives of the study are: 1) describe changes in the demographic, risk factors and clinical stage of patients with HIV infection initially seen in our center; 2) assess changing trends from the clinical and immunological perspective across time; 3) describe mortality risk of patients particularly after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a cross-sectional study of 3,569 patients admitted to the RRC at the Universidad Central del Caribe between years 1992 through 2005. The variables studied were demographic, risk factors exposure, HIV status at baseline, clinical and immunological parameters, ART and the mortality risk. Chi square with Cramer's coefficient, Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis were performed. The study revealed that individuals presenting at our health care facilities are older and that the proportion of females has increased. The risk factor profile shows increase in heterosexual contact with the disease. The study found that patients treated with ART had significantly lower mortality risk than those without ART. Patients who arrive to RRC with AIDS and Intravenous Drug Users (IDU) had a higher mortality risk than participants with HIV. The analysis of the trends showed changes in the demographic and clinical profile of patients across the years. HIV/AIDS prevention programs and policies need to be continued in Puerto Rico in order to better control the spread of the epidemic."

The activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‑like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases is significant in innate immunity, as it restricts numerous viruses, including HBV, through hypermutation‑dependent and ‑independent mechanisms. It is important to induce covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA degradation by interferon‑α without causing side effects in the infected host cell. Furthermore, organisms possess multiple mechanisms to regulate the expression of AID/APOBECs, control their enzymatic activity and restrict their access to DNA or RNA substrates. Therefore, the AID/APOBECs present promising targets for preventing and treating viral infections. In addition, gene polymorphisms of the AID/APOBEC family may alter host susceptibility to HBV acquisition and CH disease progression. Through G‑to‑A hypermutation, AID/APOBECs also edit HBV DNA and facilitate the mutation of HBV DNA, which may assist the virus to evolve and potentially escape from the immune responses. The AID/APOBEC family and their associated editing patterns may also exert oncogenic activity. Understanding the effects of cytidine deaminases in CH virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may aid with developing efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HCC."

Furthermore, evidence suggests that adherence rates of between 70% and 89% are significantly associated with viral rebound and the development of drug resistance. Adherence rates at and above the 95% level are difficult for patients to achieve and maintain. Our aim was to determine if an adherence intervention could improve adherence among patients attending an ambulatory care clinic at a large public hospital. The intervention was delivered by a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals and consisted of education coupled with the provision of devices designed to assist patient memory and adherence. A crucial component of the intervention consisted of the identification of patient specific barriers to adherence and the development of strategies to circumvent these problems. Adherence was assessed using patient self-report over the past 4, 7, and 28 days and by calculation of the Morisky score. The study was conducted as a randomised controlled trial using the stepped wedge design with a total of 68 subjects randomised to receive the intervention over a 20-week period. Adherence before and after the intervention formed the analysis. There was a significant decrease in the number of missed doses over the past 4 (1.9 to 1.0, p < 0.001), 7 (3.0 to 1.8, p < 0.001) and 28 (7.4 to 4.2, p < 0.001) days and a decrease in the Morisky score, indicating an improvement in medication taking behaviour (1.3 to 0.5 p < 0.001)."

HBV core promoter overlaps partially with HBx coding sequence, so the nucleotide 1762 and 1764 mutations induce HBV X protein (HBx) 130 and 131 substitutions. We sought to elucidate the impact of HBx mutations on HCC development. Chronically HBV-infected patients were enrolled in this study: 42 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, 23 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 31 HCC patients. Direct sequencing showed HBx131, HBx130, HBx5, HBx94, and HBx38 amino acid mutations were common in HCC patients. Of various mutations, HBx130+HBx131 (double) mutations and HBx5+HBx130+HBx131 (triple) mutations were significantly high in HCC patients. Double and triple mutations increased the risk for HCC by 3.75-fold (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.101 to 12.768, P = 0.033) and 5.34-fold (95% CI = 1.65 to 17.309, P = 0.005), respectively, when HCC patients were compared to CHB patients. Functionally, there were significantly higher levels of NF-κB activity in cells with the HBx5 mutant and with the double mutants than that of wild-type cells and the triple-mutant cells. The triple mutation did not increase NF-κB activity. Other regulatory pathways seem to exist for NF-κB activation. In conclusion, a specific HBx mutation may contribute to HCC development by activating NF-κB activity. The HBx5 mutation in genotype C2 HBV appears to be a risk factor for the development of HCC and may be used to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic HBV infection."

To further characterize HSE as it affects the immunodeficient, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathological findings in three immunocompromised patients with autopsy-proven HSE. Two patients had cancer (one with lymphoma and another with glioblastoma multiforme), one was known to be human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1)-seropositive and a second was suspected of harboring underlying HIV-1 infection. Two were receiving dexamethasone at onset of HSE. All had fever, mental status changes and new, focal neurological deficits or worsening of established deficits. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis was absent or minimal and head computerized tomographic (CT) scans, performed in all cases, were unrevealing. No patient was clinically suspected of having HSE, only one received acyclovir (for concurrent mucocutaneous herpes) and HSE played a major role in all deaths. Autopsy revealed an unusual form of HSE characterized by a noninflammatory, pseudoischemic histological presentation and the unexpected persistence of viral antigens in abundance despite survival beyond the clinical stage during which inflammatory responses usually peak and productive brain infection wanes. The incidence of HSE in the immunocompromised may be underestimated. Preexistent neurological disease, a noninflammatory CSF profile and negative CT scan may confound the diagnosis in this population, a typical clinical presentation notwithstanding. Increased clinical suspicion, the use of magnetic resonance imaging and polymerase chain reaction analysis of CSF for herpes simplex virus nucleic acid sequences may permit more rapid diagnosis and treatment. The absence of inflammatory infiltrates in some fatal cases of HSE suggests that an intact immune response is not requisite to the devastating neurological injury characteristic of this disorder."

From June 30, 1983 through June 30, 1988, MK was isolated from 72 patients. Twenty-three of the 72 (31.9%) were found to be coinfected with HIV-1. Over the 5-year study period, the phenomenon of dual infection increased from 0 to 50%. Six cases of extrapulmonary infection were found among the HIV-1 patients as compared to 1 in 49 non-HIV patients (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). In addition, patients with dual infection had atypical chest radiographs, usually with interstitial infiltrates without cavitation. Most of these patients died within 12 months (90.9%).

Immune activation therapy has begun to be used in attempts to increase the turnover rate of the latent virus reservoir through activation of infected cells that comprise this reservoir, in order to promote cell death and accelerate virus clearance. Recent reports have not demonstrated complete virus ablation. Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation now appears as a safe, feasible, and reasonable approach for Aids-related lymphoma in patients who meet criteria for transplantation. The hypothesis is based on the possibility that hematopoietic stem cells from a HIV-positive patient could be collected before the patient becomes infected with HIV. Then, the proposed treatment consists of the following assumptions. HAART keeps viral replication below the level of detection, limiting the infection to latent provirus in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. It is presumed here that myeloablative conditioning regimen can lead to the killing of all the cells that, in theory, harbour the virus. The following transplantation of the autologous hematopoietic stem cells, collected before HIV infection, would allow the complete recovery. The hypothesis is to be tested on a suitable animal model. After the collection of hematopoietic stem cells, the animal is experimentally infected with the immunodeficiency virus. HAART is given after plasma viral RNA becomes detectable. By myeloablative conditioning regimen all the cells harbouring the virus are supposed to be killed. Then, as the viral load is kept undetectable by HAART, the animal undergoes autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Antiretroviral therapy is interrupted a month after engraftment has taken place. Although hematopoietic stem cells from man before infection with HIV are unlikely to be available, a successful test on the animal would suggest a new approach which could allow the cure of HIV in future."

We aimed to assess the background, the therapeutic challenges and the prospective monitoring of all patients treated with a combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including maraviroc. Sixty-six patients started a maraviroc-containing cART with a history of HIV infection lasting 13.9±10.7 years. This interim analysis presents patients who had at least 12 (mean 16.9±12.8) months of follow-up. One to 17 previous cART changes prompted the introduction of maraviroc in rescue regimens in the great majority of patients considered (53 of 66); in 13 cases, maraviroc was given to patients with advanced HIV disease and no immune recovery after 2-3 years of a virologically-effective cART. The most frequent companion antiretroviral agents were: darunavir/ritonavir (51 cases), raltegravir (49 subjects), and etravirine (36 cases). The most common underlying conditions were: AIDS (41 cases), liver cirrhosis (21), AIDS-related or other malignancies (20 cases), major cardiovascular events (18 cases), osteonecrosis and haemodialysis-treated kidney failure (3 cases each). A chronic HCV and HBV hepatitis were of concern in 25 and 13 patients. The addition of maraviroc added favourably to clinical-laboratory markers of HIV disease progression, and those of comorbid conditions. HIV viraemia became (or remained) undetectable in 55 patients of 66 (83.3%). An improvement in CD4+ count was observed in all 66 patients, based on a mean 24.9±19.2% increase versus baseline, paralleled by an improvement in mean absolute CD4+ count of 134.7±121.1 cells/μL. A tendency towards an increased mean and peak CD4+ count was observed in the subgroup receiving a maraviroc-raltegravir-based cART. As no clinical-laboratory adverse events attributable to maraviroc occurred, nobody discontinued the study drug. Only mild-transient gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue and anorexia, were reported during maraviroc administration, but their relationship with the study drug was difficult to assess because of the multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Our preliminary experience with maraviroc, even considering the limits of the proportionally reduced sample, the patients' salvage stage of advanced disease and the related-unrelated morbidities, underlines its excellent efficacy and safety profile."

HPV DNA detection as well as cytological abnormalities were associated neither with HIV RNA detection in plasma nor with CD4+ T-cell count. Differences in age or in time since HIV acquisition were not observed in patients with or without cytological abnormalities.

As proof of concept, we herein evaluated the modulation of HIV/macrophages interactions associated with two ubiquitous T(h)2 cytokines, namely, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, using the in vitro model of R5-HIV-1 transfer from macrophages to T lymphocytes. Monocyte-derived macrophages differentiated in the presence of IL-4 (M-4) transferred the virus to T cells more efficiently than those differentiated in the presence of interleukin-13 (M-13), likely because to their high capacity to capture and produce HIV-1 and to recruit HIV-1 target T cell. However, M-13 harbored high levels of HIV DNA, similarly to M-4, and secreted HIV-activating factors. Notably, uninfected macrophages recruited HIV-1 target T cells (CCR4(+)IL-13(+) T(h)2 cells and CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells), indicating their role in facilitating the HIV-1 spread by a passive manner. Strikingly, R5-HIV-1 reprogrammed macrophages toward a T(h)1 secretion pattern. Thus, T(h)2 microenvironment facilitates the emergence of HIV-1 macrophage reservoir and HIV-1 spread. In conclusion, secreted cytokines within mucosae may differentially influence both the HIV-1 production within the mucosal target cells reservoir and its spread thorough the mucosal tissue."

Antibodies to HTLV-1 were found in 32/704 (4.5%) of the patients. Each co-infected individual was matched with two HIV mono-infected patients according to World Health Organization clinical stage, age +/-5 years and gender. Key clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Mono-infected and co-infected patients displayed similar clinical characteristics. However, co-infected patients had higher absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (P = 0.001), higher percentage CD4+ T-cell counts (P < 0.001) and higher CD4/CD8 ratios (P < 0.001). Although HIV plasma RNA viral loads were inversely correlated with CD4+ T-cell-counts in mono-infected patients (P < 0.0001), a correlation was not found in co-infected individuals (P = 0.11). Patients with untreated HIV and HTLV-1 co-infection show a dissociation between immunological and HIV virological markers. Current recommendations for initiating ART and chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections in resource-poor settings rely on more readily available CD4+ T-cell counts without viral load parameters. These guidelines are not appropriate for co-infected individuals in whom high CD4+ T-cell counts persist despite high HIV viral load states. Thus, for co-infected patients, even in resource-poor settings, HIV viral loads are likely to contribute information crucial for the appropriate timing of ART introduction."

A better understanding of the HCV life-cycle has recently resulted in the development of several potential direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) targeting viral proteins (NS3/4A protease, NS5B nucleos(t)idic and non-nucleos(t)idic polymerase, NS5A viral replication complex). First generation protease inhibitors in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV are not efficient in genotype 3-infected patients. The combination of PEG-IFN/RBV with Daclatasvir, a NS5A inhibitor for 12-24 weeks results in a SVR in around 75% while the triple combination of PEG-IFN/RBV with the oral nucleotidic polymerase inhibitor Sofosbuvir (GS-7977) for 12 weeks in naïve patients results in a SVR in more than 95%. The results of the first oral combination of Sofosbuvir and RBV for 12 weeks in genotype 3-infected patients have been rather disappointing with a slightly lower SVR than after 24 weeks of PEG-IFN: around 60%, and only 30% in patients with cirrhosis. Extending treatment from 12 to 16 weeks in treatment experienced patients doubled the SVR rate and an 80% SVR rate is expected by extending treatment to 24 weeks. The best oral combination of new DAAs is probably the combination of Sofosbuvir and a NS5A inhibitor (Daclatasvir, Ledipasvir…) for 24 weeks, which resulted in a 100% SVR rate in a limited series. The use of cyclophilin inhibitors, a host-targeted antiviral, in association with DAAs and/or RBV may also be of interest. The oral combination of new DAAs (dual or triple combination of different antivirals) or of DAAs and host targets such as cyclophilin will probably become the SOC for genotype 3-infected treatment-naïve or -experienced patients.

We undertook a retrospective study of 501 HIV-seropositive patients to assess the yield of percutaneous liver biopsy. The most common indications for liver biopsy were liver test abnormalities (89.5%), fever for 2 weeks (71.9%), and hepatomegaly (52.0%). The most common biopsy-derived diagnosis was Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), seen in 87 (17.4%) biopsies. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was found in 13 biopsies (2.6%). In 28 biopsies (5.6%) mycobacteria was seen, but speciation of the organism was not possible. Chronic active viral hepatitis was seen in 60 biopsies (12.0%). Opportunistic hepatic infection from other organisms was found in 14 biopsies (2.8%). The most common neoplasm was lymphoma, which was seen in 12 biopsies (2.4%). MAC infection of the liver was associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01). Among patients with fever for 2 weeks after an extensive negative workup including bone marrow biopsy, 58.2% had a diagnosis by liver biopsy. Overall, 64.3% of liver biopsies yielded a histopathological diagnosis, 45.7% of which were potentially treatable. We could not evaluate whether liver biopsy had a positive effect on patient outcome and survival, nor did we attempt to prove that liver biopsy resulted in a change in treatment or a change in preprocedure clinical diagnosis. Thus, questions about the efficacy of liver biopsy cannot be answered. Liver biopsy may be a helpful diagnostic tool in HIV-positive patients with fever, liver test abnormalities or hepatomegaly."

We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."

Quantifications were performed by commercially available assays (NASBA [nucleic acid sequence-based amplification] or Amplicor, or both). There was a strong correlation between HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma and DPSs. More importantly, there was no decline in HIV-1 RNA levels in DPSs stored for as long as 2 weeks at 20 degrees C. Similarly, storage of DPSs for 3 days at 37 degrees C resulted in no decrease in viral RNA levels. For patients with primary infection, the DPS method allowed for the measurement of RNA levels in plasma during the initial spike in the level of viremia and in the subsequent period of suppressed viral replication. DPS quantification was equally informative in the neonatal setting, with all five newborns showing HIV-1 RNA loads of greater than 4.991 log10 copies/ml. We conclude that the viral RNA levels in DPSs are equivalent to those measured in fresh-frozen plasma. The ease and economy of DPS sampling, the minute volumes required, and the unexpected stability of dried RNA suggest that the use of DPSs will be particularly valuable for small-volume neonatal samples and large, population-based studies in which cold storage and transportation present special problems, as is often the case in developing countries. The ability to measure viral changes during primary infection suggests that the method will be useful for assessing vaccine efficacy in large field trials."

We have reviewed the haematologic findings in well-characterized cohorts of patients with AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC) and asymptomatic homosexual men at risk for this retrovirus. Anaemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were found in increasing prevalence according to the severity of clinical disease associated with retroviral infection. Bone marrow aspirations and biopsies revealed frequent hypercellularity, dysplasia, plasmacytosis and lymphoid infiltrates. These marrow morphologic findings were strongly associated with anaemia and granulocytopenia. Review of transfusion records of patients with HIV antibodies revealed a 21% prevalence of a positive direct antiglobulin test. The pathophysiology of the observed haematologic abnormalities may involve direct retroviral infection of bone marrow progenitors, abnormal regulation of haematopoiesis and/or autoimmune phenomena."

However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

Longitudinal data were collected on 202 HIV-infected women without AIDS who were receiving care at Kings County Hospital or SUNY Health Sciences Center, Brooklyn, New York. Internal consistency results showed acceptable reliability for the four multi-item MOS scales (role function, physical function, general health perceptions and mental health). Symptomatic patients and patients with lower Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ratings reported lower HRQOL than those who were asymptomatic or who had higher KPS scores. Patients who were older, unemployed or who had a history of injection drug use (IDU) also reported lower HRQOL than those who were younger, employed or who had no drug use history. Adjusted mean scores on the MOS role and physical functioning scales proved sensitive to differences in clinical status over time. The MOS SF-20 is a reliable and valid instrument of HRQOL for women with HIV infection. Its sensitivity to differences in clinical status over time suggest that it may be useful as an HRQOL indicator for HIV/AIDS clinical trials."

The molecular basis for the integrase-LEDGF/p75 interaction is understood, while the mechanism of chromatin binding is unknown. The PWWP domain is homologous to other protein interaction modules that together comprise the Tudor clan. Based on primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structural similarities, 24 residues of the LEDGF/p75 PWWP domain were mutagenized to garner essential details of its function during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mutating either Trp-21 or Ala-51, which line the inner wall of a hydrophobic cavity that is common to Tudor clan members, disrupts chromatin binding and virus infectivity. Consistent with a role for chromatin-associated LEDGF/p75 in stimulating integrase activity during infection, recombinant W21A protein is preferentially defective for enhancing integration into chromatinized target DNA in vitro. The A51P mutation corresponds to the S270P change in DNA methyltransferase 3B that causes human immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly syndrome, revealing a critical role for this amino acid position in the chromatin binding functions of varied PWWP domains. Our results furthermore highlight the requirement for a conserved Glu in the hydrophobic core that mediates interactions between other Tudor clan members and their substrates. This initial systematic mutagenesis of a PWWP domain identifies amino acid residues critical for chromatin binding function and the consequences of their changes on HIV-1 integration and infection."

Not surprising therefore overall, drug users were the heaviest users of the inpatient facilities (74% of the discharges and 65% of the bed days) although homosexuals had the highest discharge rate (114 per 100 person years) and rate of bed day use (1654 days per 100 person years). Immunodeficiency (CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) and a clinical diagnosis of AIDS were both associated with greater inpatient and outpatient resource use compared to those without immunodeficiency (CD4 count > or = 200 CD4 cells/ul) or AIDS. Gender effects were complex; the ALOS for women was increased for all risk groups whatever the CD4 count whilst there was no consistent trend of more resource use for women by risk group. Drug users were the heaviest overall users of the local hospice (84% of all admissions, 83% of the bed days and a discharge rate of 76.4 per 100 person years), more than double the rates experienced by the other risk groups. Thus both clinical and immunological staging (AIDS or a CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) were associated with increased resource use in HIV infection and estimates of resource use for AIDS need to be increased by around one-third to take into account hospice use. Despite the preponderance of drug users in Edinburgh, comparisons with other centres did not reveal increased resource use."

Care for HCV infection, however, can be used as an instrument to engage drug-using persons in ongoing primary care relationships. Common elements to both care for HCV infection and primary care for HIV infection are testing for and counseling about HCV and HIV, substance abuse and mental health services, social support, and subspecialty referral.

We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."

The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."

Several amino acid substitutions at position 190 of reverse transcriptase (RT) have been associated with reduced susceptibility to the NNRTI, especially nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). In the present study, the effects of various 190 substitutions observed in viruses obtained from NNRTI-experienced patients were characterized with patient-derived HIV isolates and confirmed with a panel of isogenic viruses. Compared to wild-type HIV, which has a glycine at position 190 (G190), viruses with 190 substitutions (A, C, Q, S, V, E, or T, collectively referred to as G190X substitutions) were markedly less susceptible to NVP and EFV. In contrast, delavirdine (DLV) susceptibility of these G190X viruses increased from 3 to 300-fold (hypersusceptible) or was only slightly decreased. The replication capacity of viruses with certain 190 substitutions (C, Q, V, T, and E) was severely impaired and was correlated with reduced virion-associated RT activity and incomplete protease (PR) processing of the viral p55(gag) polyprotein. These defects were the result of inadequate p160(gagpol) incorporation into virions. Compensatory mutations within RT and PR improved replication capacity, p55(gag) processing, and RT activity, presumably through increased incorporation of p160(gagpol) into virions. We observe an inverse relationship between the degree of NVP and EFV resistance and the impairment of viral replication in viruses with substitutions at 190 in RT. These observations may have important implications for the future design and development of antiretroviral drugs that restrict the outgrowth of resistant variants with high replication capacity."

Consecutive singleton pregnancies delivered beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy were included. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was defined as a birth weight below the 10th customised centile for gestational age and IUGR babies were compared to non-IUGR newborns. Intrauterine Doppler findings were described among IUGR foetuses. Baseline characteristics, HIV infection data and perinatal outcome were compared between groups. The results were adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 156 singleton pregnancies were included. IUGR occurred in 23.4 % of cases (38/156). In two-thirds of the cases detected before birth, Doppler abnormalities compatible with placental insufficiency were observed. IUGR pregnancies presented a worse perinatal outcome, mainly due to a higher risk of iatrogenic preterm delivery [adjusted odds ratio 6.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.4-33.5]. IUGR foetuses also had a higher risk of emergent Caesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admission. No cases of intrauterine foetal death occurred. A high rate of IUGR was observed among HIV pregnancies, and it was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, mainly iatrogenic preterm and very preterm birth due to placental insufficiency. Our results support that ultrasound detection and follow-up of IUGR foetuses should be part of routine antenatal care in this high-risk population to improve antenatal management."

A sectional study was performed in 300 HIV-infected patients to measure BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Age, gender, anthropometric parameters, nadir and current CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, smoking habit, and current antiretroviral therapy (ART) associations were investigated by multivariable analysis. Based on World Health Organization T-score ranges, low BMD (T-score <-1.0 standard deviation [SD] in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 and older or Z-score <- 2.0 SD in premenopausal women and men below the age of 50) was detected in 54.7% (95% confidence interval: 49.1-60.3%) of the 300 enrolled patients. The observed median age was 46 yr (interquartile range: 39-52), 58% were male, 88.5% were on ART, and 21.4% smoked. The following factors were identified, by multiple logistic modeling, as being independently associated with low BMD: (1) male gender (4.6 [1.28-16.39]), (2) body mass index lower than 25 kg/m(2) (2.9 [1.31-6.49]), (3) menopause (13.4 [2.53-71.12]), and (4) HIV-1 undetectable viral load (7.9 [1.96-32.25]). Conversely, zidovudine (0.2 [0.04-0.85]) and nevirapine (0.1 [0.02-0.38]) use were inversely associated with low BMD. Low BMD was frequently found in our cohort of about 300 Brazilian HIV-infected subjects. This study supports the need for periodic DXA testing in HIV outpatient clinics."

The present study was initiated to determine whether the decreased frequency of HP infections in HIV patients might be associated with the stage of the underlying HIV disease or concomitant drug regimens the patients had received. 60 randomly selected HIV outpatients were stratified according to the stage of their HIV infection (CDC classification), their CD4 cell count and to the drug regimens they were given. Within these subgroups of patients, HP infection prevalence was separately investigated by serological and C13 breath testing. Data were compared to a reference population of 30 healthy volunteers. No difference in HP infection prevalence was found between the HIV infected patients in general and the reference cohort. A significantly lower proportion of HP infected individuals was observed among those HIV patients who had AIDS-defining diseases. Furthermore, a substantial but insignificant decrease of HP infection prevalence was noted in HIV patients with an extensive decline of CD4 cell count (< 100/microl). HIV patients who had received antimicrobial or H2-antagonizing drugs within 12 months prior to the study commencement also were found to have a remarkably decreased frequency of HP infections independently of their CD4 cell count. No association between HP infection prevalence and patients age, sex, risk group and the type of their antiretroviral treatment was found.We concluded from these results that the decreased HP infection prevalence in HIV patients may, apart from frequent antibiotic treatment, be correlated to the stage of HIV-mediated immune suppression."

A total of 845 samples were received at tertiary care hospital of Islamabad and were screened for hepatitis B and C. The ELISA was used to detect antigen for HBV and antibodies for HCV in patient serum. Among 845 collected samples, 255 (30.1%) were seropositive for HBV and HCV. Out of 255 seropositive samples, 45 (5.3%) were positive for HBsAg while 199 (23.5%) were positive for anti-HCV. Among 255, 11 (1.3%) were seropositive for both HBsAg and anti-HCV (coinfection). Among the seropositive male, HBV was more prevalent (23.8%) while female patients had a high incidence of HCV (52.2%). Among the age group variable, HBV, HCV, and coinfection were found to be more common in the age groups of 21-30 (29%) and 30-40 (24%) years. The seropositivity for HBsAg was higher in unmarried individuals (31.2%) while anti-HCV was more prevalent in married individuals (84%). The present study provides the preliminary information about high HCV and HBV prevalence. Findings from the current study will be helpful for the better management and control of viral hepatitis among patients seeking hospital care. "

However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."

Patients coinfected with HCV and schistosomiasis exhibit a unique clinical, virological and histological pattern manifested by viral persistence with high HCV RNA titers as well as higher necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores in their liver biopsy samples. Dual infections of schistosomiasis and viral infections display significant influences on host immune reactions including cytokine shift pattern alteration, cytotoxic T lymphocyte response and other impaired immunologic functions with diminished capacity to clear the virus. We investigated the cytokine pattern against HCV and S. mansoni antigens in patients coinfected with HCV and S. mansoni and compared them with responses in patients infected with HCV or S. mansoni alone. This study included 4 groups; (Gr I) included 20 patients infected with chronic HCV, their sera were reactive for anti-HCV antibodies, samples were verified for RNA detection to identify those who have viremia. (Gr II) included 15 patients infected with schistosomiasis alone, they were subjected to detection of S. mansoni ova in stool, rectal snip or serological test. (Gr III) included 20 patients with chronic HCV and schistosomiasis coinfection, which were diagnosed by the above-mentioned criteria. (Gr IV) included 15 healthy individuals, who were matched for age and sex and have no evidence of liver diseases served as control subjects. The results showed that a highly significant increase in serum IFN-gamma and IL-18 levels in patients infected with HCV alone compared with the other patient groups and control. On the other hand, a highly significant increase was found in serum IL-4 and IL-10 levels in coinfected patients and patients with schistosomiasis alone compared with the control but a significant increase was found in the two groups compared with HCV patients. A significant increase in serum IL-4 and IL-10 were also found in HCV patients compared with the control. In conclusions, our data showed that coinfected patients have dominant Th2 cytokine profile induced by S. mansoni and this Th2 antagonized and down-regulated the antiviral activities of Th1 cytokine profile in HCV infection that probably acquired after S. mansoni infection resulting in failing to mount significant HCV specific Th1 response and thereby fail to clear the virus in coinfected, compared with patients infected with HCV or schistosomiasis alone."

Antiretrovirals that achieve higher concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with better control of HIV and improved cognition. The objective of this study was to measure total raltegravir (RAL) concentrations in CSF and to compare them with matched concentrations in plasma and in vitro inhibitory concentrations. Eighteen subjects with HIV-1 infection were enrolled based on the use of RAL-containing regimens and the availability of CSF and matched plasma samples. RAL was measured in 21 CSF and plasma pairs by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and HIV RNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). RAL concentrations were compared to the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for wild-type HIV-1 (3.2 ng/ml). Volunteers were predominantly middle-aged white men with AIDS and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median concurrent CD4(+) cell count was 276/μl, and 28% of CD4(+) cell counts were below 200/μl. HIV RNA was detectable in 38% of plasma specimens and 4% of CSF specimens. RAL was present in all CSF specimens, with a median total concentration of 14.5 ng/ml. The median concentration in plasma was 260.9 ng/ml, with a median CSF-to-plasma ratio of 0.058. Concentrations in CSF correlated with those in with plasma (r(2), 0.24; P, 0.02) but not with the postdose sampling time (P, >0.50). RAL concentrations in CSF exceeded the IC(50) for wild-type HIV in all specimens by a median of 4.5-fold. RAL is present in CSF and reaches sufficiently high concentrations to inhibit wild-type HIV in all individuals. As a component of effective antiretroviral regimens or as the main antiretroviral, RAL likely contributes to the control of HIV replication in the nervous system."

The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "

Survival in HIV infected individuals receiving renal replacement therapy has improved since the introduction of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Current experience in renal transplantation in HIV-infected patients in the United States indicates that the three-year survival rate is similar to that of HIV-negative transplant recipients, with virological and immunological control of the infection by HAART and no increase in the number of opportunistic infections or tumors. The criteria for selecting renal transplantation candidates in this population are the following: no aids-defining events, CD4 cells > 200 cells/.l and undetectable viral load under HAART. In Spain, where most of these patients are former drug abusers, a two-year period of abstinence from cocaine and heroine abuse is also required, although patients can be participating in the methadone program. The main problems in the post-transplantation period have been interactions between HAART and immunosuppressive drugs, management of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection and the high rate of acute rejection. To date, seven such renal transplantations have been performed in Spain, with favorable patient and graft survival and no progression to aids."

Patients with so-called 'resolved hepatitis B virus infection' (HBsAg-negative/cAb-positive) may also be at risk. We performed a systematic review of the English and Chinese language literature to estimate the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HBsAg-negative/cAb-positive patients receiving rituximab for lymphoma. A pooled risk estimate was calculated for HBV reactivation. The impact of HBsAb status and study design on reactivation rates was explored. Data from 578 patients in 15 studies were included. 'Clinical HBV reactivation', (ALT >3 × normal and either an increase in HBV DNA from baseline or HBsAg seroreversion), was estimated at 6.3% (I(2) = 63%, P = 0.006). Significant heterogeneity was detected. Reactivation rates were higher in prospective vs retrospective studies (14.2% vs 3.8%; OR = 4.39, 95% CI 0.83-23.28). Exploratory analyses found no effect of HBsAb status on reactivation risk (OR = 0.083; P = 0.151). Our meta-analysis confirms a measurable and potentially substantial risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative/cAb-positive patients exposed to rituximab. However, heterogeneity in the existing literature limits the generalizability of our findings. Large, prospective studies, with uniform definitions of HBV reactivation, are needed to clarify the risk of HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative/cAb-positive patients."

Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."

In this study, the basic core promoter (BCP) and the preS/S regions of HBV isolated from 61 pairs of HBV/HIV co-infected and HBV mono-infected participants were analyzed. We found that the prevalence of HBV isolates with 1762T/1764A and/or preS deletion mutations was 37.7% (95% CI: 29.1-46.3).

The serum samples were screened for HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV markers by a commercial chemiluminescence method (UniCel Dxl 800, Beckman Coulter, USA), during a six months period (January 1st to June 30th, 2006). As a result the seropositivity rates of HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV were found as 5.1% (119/2335), 0.9% (18/2066) and 0.1% (3/2548), respectively. While anti-HCV seropositive results were approved by confirmation tests, three of anti-HIV positive results were not confirmed and accepted as false positivities. HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV seropositivities detected in our study were similar to the rates previously reported in other studies in Turkey. However, HBsAg positivity was found slightly higher than the rates that were reported from western parts of our country. This result may be related to the lower socioeconomical status of Sanliurfa (which is located in Southeast Anatolia), and indicates that HBV should be considered as a serious public health problem in East and Southeast parts of Turkey."

Except for the ""passive"" antibody peak observed in babies, the anti-HAV age-specific prevalence was negligible until the age of 3; it then increased, reaching 35% by the age of 15. Serological evidence of HBV was present in 16% of the subjects: this prevalence was almost constant at all ages. The HBsAg carrier rate was highest in children under 5 years of age (7.6%) and decreased with age. However, only one HBsAg carrier was under 1 year of age. Anti-HBs age-specific prevalence increased progressively from 2.7% to 11.4%. Anti-HBc alone was present in 4.1% of the subjects. No significant sex differences were found in the prevalence of HBV serum markers or in the HBsAg carrier rate. Neither HAV nor HBV infection was significantly influenced by place of residence or socioeconomic status. It is concluded that in this area both HAV and HBV are endemic, but while HAV is mainly acquired at school, most of the HBV infections occur within the household. The results suggest that not only perinatal transmission, but also intrafamilial horizontal infection, plays a role in HBV spread among infants."

Sixty-five biopsies (44%) showed minimal changes (MC), 82 biopsies (55%) showed chronic liver disease (CLD) and 2 biopsies (1%) showed hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocyte HBsAg was found in 144 biopsies (97%). It was present in the cytoplasm of 141 specimens (95%) and/or plasma membrane of 48 specimens (32%).

Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."

We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "

This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively.

Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."

A new strategy for HBV prevention in the USA includes integration of HBV vaccine into childhood immunisation schedules. Vaccination strategies that target high risk groups have not been effective. To determine the frequency and severity of community acquired chronic hepatitis C, patients with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis identified in four sentinel counties in the United States were followed prospectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was found in 106 (82%) of 130 patients. Ninety three per cent of the HCV positive patients had a risk factor for their infection: 59% parenteral, 6% sexual or household, and 28% low socioeconomic level. Chronic hepatitis developed in 62%, independently of the risk factor for infection. HCV-RNA persisted in most patients, including those with biochemical resolution of their hepatitis.

The Kaplan-Meier's method and the Long-rank test were used for the survival, and the Cox's multivariate method to identify the variables associated with mortality by means of SPSS 9.0. 78 individuals of the total died at the end of study, 71.8% belonged to the pre highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era and 28.2% to the later period. From all deceased cases due to TB, 82.1% were diagnosed in the pre HAART era. The median survival was 41 months (CI=20-62). TB diagnosis in the pre HAART period, TB not being the first disease indicator of AIDS, suffering from candidiasis of esophagus before TB and a LTCD4+ count < 200 at the diagnosis of TB, were all independently associated with mortality. This study demonstrated the positive impact of HAART in the survival of Cuban AIDS patients with TB and also identified advanced immunodepression and opportunistic infections as predictors of mortality."
4676,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Lentiviruses infect both dividing and nondividing cells. In this study we characterized a lentiviral vector system consisting of a packaging vector (pHP) and a transducing vector (pTV) derived from a recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In pHP, the long terminal repeats (LTRs), the 5' untranslated leader and portions of the env and nef genes were deleted. The leader sequence of pHP was substituted with a modified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) 59 bp leader containing a mutated RSV gag AUG and a functional 5' splice site. The pHP construct was found to direct Gag-Pol synthesis as efficiently as wild-type HIV-1. The pTV construct contains sequences required for RNA packaging, reverse transcription and integration, but lacks viral genes. Co-transfection of pHP, pTV and a vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) envelope plasmid produced vectors at titers of 10(5)-10(6) transducing units per milliliter in 48 h. Replication-competent virus (RCV) was not detected when deletions were made in the env gene in pHP. The ability of this vector system to transduce dividing and nondividing cell in vitro and in vivo was also demonstrated. Compared with a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector, the HP/TV vectors transduced human muscle-, kidney-, liver-derived cell lines and CD34+ primary hematopoietic progenitor cells more efficiently. Although the levels of the pTV transgene expression were high soon after transduction, the expression tended to decrease with time due either to the loss of proviral DNA or to the inactivation of promoter activity, which was found to be cell type-dependent. Analyses of extrachromosomal DNA showed that the unintegrated proviral DNA of lentiviral vectors survived much longer than that of the retroviral vectors. We demonstrate that the HP/TV vector is capable of high efficiency transduction and that long-term expression of lentiviral vectors is dependent on target cell type, the internal promoter and the transgene itself in the transducing vector."
420,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The Taormina Consensus Conference defined 'occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection' (OBI) as the 'presence of HBV DNA in the liver of individuals testing HBsAg-negative with currently available assays'. Most occult is the so-called 'window period' after exposure before HBV DNA appears in the blood. We identified two blood donors whose donations tested HBsAg- and HBV DNA-negative, but transmitted HBV. Both subsequently developed HBsAg and acute hepatitis. However, such cases are not considered as true OBI. A true transient OBI remains HBsAg-negative during the entire course. One case of acute OBI showed a peak viremia of 15,000 IU/ml HBV DNA and sub-borderline HBsAg, suggesting a ratio of virions to subviral particles of 1:10, whereas 'normal' cases show at peak viremia a ratio of 1:3,000. Blood donors with OBI may transmit HBV. We studied 5 blood donors with OBI and 55 of their recipients. In 22 recipients, transmission was probable, but they remained healthy. However, in 3 recipients, who were immunosuppressed at the time of transfusion, fatal fulminant hepatitis B developed. The majority of anti-HBc-positive healthy individuals have HBV DNA in the liver which may start replication under severe immunosuppression. Nine such cases are described here. OBI or reactivated HBV infections often lead to selection of HBsAg escape mutations as we could show in 11 of 14 cases. Infection of vaccinated individuals favors development of OBI as we observed in 6 blood donors. HB vaccination may solve the problem of overt HBV infection but may favor OBI."
1493,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.

4794,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
9173,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The extent to which HIV-1 proviral DNA mutations cause clinically relevant antiretroviral resistance is still controversial. Paired plasma HIV-1 RNA and whole blood DNA were compared in patients failing HAART to investigate if the additional knowledge of archived mutations could improve the selection of potentially active drugs. Seventy-three HIV-1-infected patients with first/second HAART failure were studied before starting a new regimen based on RNA genotyping. Follow-up data after a 12-week therapy were available. DNA genotyping was retrospectively performed on stored whole blood samples and mutational profiles were compared to those from RNA. The mean number of IAS pol mutations was significantly higher in RNA (4.45 +/- 2.76) than in DNA (2.88 +/- 2.47) (P < 0.001). DNA genotyping provided a 6% increase in detection of resistance-associated mutations. Among 64/73 patients showing discordant DNA/RNA profiles, 54 (84%) also differed for predicted active drugs. 16/73 (22%) patients had >or=1 mutation revealed by DNA genotyping alone, probably affecting therapy success in 2/16. However, neither RNA/DNA discordance nor detection of isolated DNA mutations were statistically associated with outcome. In conclusion, plasma RNA remains the elective choice for HIV genotyping in patients with therapy failure, even if the detection of proviral resistance-associated mutations, not simultaneously found in RNA, is a frequent event. Therefore, in some cases DNA plus RNA genotyping might assist in choosing more accurately subsequent antiretroviral regimens."

This was a prospective cohort study of 550 individuals in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort initiating ART between 2000 and 2012. The relationship between alcohol consumption (defined using NIAAA categories of non-, moderate, and hazardous drinkers) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score) by ART class was assessed using linear mixed effects models. Additionally, we examined whether the presence of HCV modified and whether viral load mediated the relationship between alcohol use and liver fibrosis. Overall, FIB-4 levels were 15.6% higher in hazardous drinkers compared to moderate drinkers (p = 0.025) after adjusting by age, sex, and race. Hazardous drinkers on PI-based regimens had FIB-4 scores 26.9% higher than moderate drinkers (p = 0.015). However, there was no difference in FIB-4 levels between hazardous drinkers on non-PI-based regimens compared to moderate drinkers (1.83% versus moderate drinkers, p = 0.848). There was no significant difference in FIB-4 between nondrinkers and moderate drinkers, irrespective of ART regimen. These associations were not modified by HCV status or mediated by viral load changes. Individuals with hazardous alcohol consumption and on PI-based regimens had significantly increased liver fibrosis, as measured by the FIB-4. These data suggest that providers should consider level of alcohol consumption when choosing an ART regimen to minimize detrimental effects on the liver."

Both new and current patients were sampled in a seroprevalence study in 1988 and again in 1992. None of the 1200 adolescents sampled were seropositive for HIV in 1988. Nine of the 1085 adolescents sampled were seropositive in 1992. Five of these 9 teens reported heterosexual contact only as a potential risk factor. Six of these 9 teens were not in school. These results suggest that HIV infection is increasing among Texas urban teens. Because current education programs do not appear to be preventing viral spread, new, focused intervention must be initiated for teenagers. In particular, an effective acquired immunodeficiency syndrome prevention program for out-of-school youth is needed urgently."

We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
3940,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Neuronal apoptosis within the central nervous system (CNS) is a characteristic feature of AIDS dementia, and it represents a common mechanism of neuronal death induced by neurotoxins (e.g., glutamate) released from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV/macrophage-induced neurotoxicity). Neuronal apoptosis may result from activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial/bcl-2 regulated) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, although which pathway predominates in CNS HIV infection is unknown. Apoptosis initiated by the intrinsic pathway is typically blocked by antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but whether these can block HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis is unknown. To determine the potential role of the Bcl-2 family in HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, we developed a unique in vitro model, utilizing the NT2 neuronal cell line, primary astrocytes and macrophages, and primary CNS HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We validated our model by demonstrating that NT2.N neurons are protected against HIV-infected macrophages by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, similar to effects seen in primary neurons. We then established stable NT2.N neuronal lines that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL, respectively) and determined their sensitivity to macrophages infected with primary R5, X4, and R5/X4 HIV-1 isolates. We found that NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by either R5, X4, or R5/X4 isolates and that resistance was abrogated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. Thus, the NMDA receptor/bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway contributes significantly to HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl-2 family proteins protect neurons against the spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates. Modulation of bcl-2 gene expression may therefore offer adjunctive neuroprotection against development of AIDS dementia."
3718,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."

During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."

The clinical, immunologic, and serologic status of the children was assessed prospectively. Fourteen subjects were symptomatic: 3 had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 5 had signs and symptoms that were compatible with HIV-1 infection (Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Ga, class P2A), and 6 had ill-defined symptoms that could not be definitely attributed to HIV. Our data indicated that the maximum rate of vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection in New Haven, Conn, was less than 30%, and the rate of HIV-1-associated disease occurring during the first 3 years of life was 16%. The mean and median time to loss of maternal antibody, as detected by Western blot in seroreverters, was approximately 7 months, and the half-life of passive antibody was 38 days. A continued close follow-up of children in the cohort studied, and others like it, is critical to learn the full range of outcomes of HIV infection in the pediatric population."

HTLV-1 infection in patients with B cell-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is rare and has been reported only in areas in which HTLV-1 is endemic. In the present study, we detected HTLV-1 proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction, using tax primers, in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a B-CLL patient, an immigrant to Israel, where HTLV-1 infection is not endemic. F344 rats injected intravenously with peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from the patient developed HTLV-1 antibodies. Titers of antibody to HTLV-1 in the rat blood were 1:512 by particle agglutination; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were also positive. No antibody against HTLV-1 was demonstrated in the animal model after inoculation of either purified B lymphocytes from the B-CLL patient or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. This is one of the few studies showing the presence of HTLV-1 provirus in T lymphocytes of a B-CLL patient who had multiple infections, and died of salmonella sepsis, and the first report of HTLV-1 antibody induction in an animal model by inoculation of lymphocytes obtained from an HTLV-1-infected B-CLL patient."

To simulate more closely the in vivo infection process for investigations of anti-HIV-1 ribozyme gene therapy, we developed a system to transfer this ribozyme gene into freshly isolated human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) using a murine retrovirus vector. Following transduction and G418 selection, human PBLs from multiple donors expressed the ribozyme and resisted challenge by HIV-1 viral clones and clinical isolates, while control vector-transduced PBLs remained fully permissive for HIV-1 infection. No inhibition of an HIV-2 clone lacking the target was seen in ribozyme-expressing PBLs. Ribozyme expression had no effect on viability or proliferation kinetics of the primary lymphocytes. This study is the first demonstration in primary human T cells of resistance to HIV-1 infection conferred by gene transfer. A human clinical trial is in development to test further the safety and efficacy of this ribozyme in PBLs of HIV-1-infected patients in vivo."

The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."

The aim of this study was to assess whether exposures to community violence are related to psychological distress, drug use, sexual risk behaviors, and medication adherence among a sample of HIV-positive young Black men who had sex with men (YBMSM). Data are from 98 YBMSM ages 18-29 years recruited from Chicago who completed measures on demographics, exposures to community violence, psychological distress, drug use, condomless anal intercourse, and medication adherence. Rates of exposure to community violence were high and youth reported victimization and witnessing numerous types of violence in their lifetime. In adjusted logistic regression analyses, models indicate that YBMSM reporting higher levels of exposure to community violence had significantly higher rates of condomless anal intercourse in the previous 6 months (AOR: 5.33, 95%CI: 1.38-20.55). Additionally, exposure to community violence was positively associated with psychological distress, hard drug use, and use of marijuana as a sex drug. Adherence to HIV antiretroviral medication was negatively associated with community violence (AOR: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97). Rates of exposure to community violence are especially high in urban communities. Overall findings suggest that treatment, intervention, and programmatic approaches that include initiatives to address exposure to community violence might correlate with better health-related outcomes for HIV-positive YBMSM."

We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."

At 24 and 48 weeks after initiation of treatment, median HIV-1 RNA levels decreased from baseline by 4.77 and 4.99 log(10) copies/mL, respectively, and median CD4 cell counts increased by 135 and 177 cells/mm(3), respectively. The regimen was generally well tolerated. No patients withdrew from the study because of adverse events. However, 7 patients developed adefovir-related nephrotoxicity after >/=20 weeks of treatment; this resolved without sequelae after adefovir was discontinued. Overall adherence was 85%. Once-daily quadruple-drug therapy with adefovir, lamivudine, didanosine, and efavirenz provides pronounced and durable suppression of HIV-1 RNA and elevation of CD4 cell counts over the course of 48 weeks, with generally good tolerability and adherence."

Participants were 73 men and women with HIV infection drawn from a larger sample of 186 clinical trial patients. Based on inclusion criteria, parent trial participants taking antiretroviral therapies, and those with complete data on self-reported measures of adherence were considered eligible for the present study. Overall, 26% of participants were found to be nonadherent, which was defined as one or more missed doses of treatment in the prior 4-day period. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine associations of sociodemographic and psychosocial variables with adherence to antiretroviral regimen. Results indicated that heterosexual participants (p < 0.01) and participants of Latino ethnicity (p < 0.05) were significantly more likely to report missed medications. Perceived satisfaction with support from a partner was associated with taking antiretroviral therapy as prescribed, whereas satisfaction with support from friends and from family was not significantly related to adherence. Examination of coping strategies showed that participants reporting drug and alcohol use (p <.05) to cope with HIV-related stress were more likely to be nonadherent. These findings call for adherence interventions designed to address barriers and strengths, such as community norms or traditional cultural values, specific to certain populations. Furthermore, couple-based approaches enlisting partner support may help persons living with HIV to adhere to antiretroviral regimens."

We previously determined that maternal plasma antibody binding to linear epitopes within the variable loop 3 (V3) region of HIV envelope (Env) and neutralizing responses against easy-to-neutralize tier 1 viruses were associated with reduced risk of peripartum HIV infection in the historic U.S. Woman and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) cohort. Here, we defined the fine specificity and function of the potentially protective maternal V3-specific IgG antibodies associated with reduced peripartum HIV transmission risk in this cohort. The V3-specific IgG binding that predicted low risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) was dependent on the C-terminal flank of the V3 crown and particularly on amino acid position 317, a residue that has also been associated with breakthrough transmission in the RV144 vaccine trial. Remarkably, the fine specificity of potentially protective maternal plasma V3-specific tier 1 virus-neutralizing responses was dependent on the same region in the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that MTCT risk is associated with neutralizing maternal IgG that targets amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the V3 loop crown, suggesting the importance of the region in immunogen design for maternal vaccines to prevent MTCT."

In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."

Because semen is a major vehicle for transmission of HIV-1, we evaluated the effects of reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy on the amount of HIV-1 in semen. The semen and blood of 11 HIV-1-infected men (i.e. treatment group) were collected before the initiation of reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy and then 8 to 18 weeks after initiation of therapy. The semen and blood of another 11 HIV-1-infected men (i.e., longitudinal group), who were not on or had no change in antiretroviral therapy for at least 2 months before study entry, were collected at approximately 2-week intervals for 10 to 26 weeks. In the treatment group, 82% of the seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA levels decreased from baseline after 8 to 18 weeks of therapy (median reduction of 1.01 log10, p = 0.01), and 100% of the blood plasma RNA levels decreased from baseline over the same period (median reduction of 0.92 log10, p = 0.003). Five of these patients were followed for at least 52 weeks and had a median seminal plasma HIV-1 RNA level of 0.66 log10 below baseline at 1 year. All subjects in the treatment group with positive cultures at baseline (50%) had negative cultures or a lower infectious units per ejaculate at the 8- to 18-week follow-up examinations. The HIV-1 RNA levels in blood and semen of the longitudinal group did not change significantly over 10 to 26 weeks. Initiation of reverse transcriptase inhibitor therapy effectively reduces shedding of HIV-1 in semen and may therefore reduce the spread of infection within populations."

The prevalence of seropositivity to HIV was 29.4%, while that of AIDS was 6.7%. Eight of the seropositive subjects were women. The average age on entrance into the Program was 28.7 +/- 7.9, and it was significantly higher among the seropositive subjects. The study sample was divided into four subgroups: women, bisexual men, homosexual men, and heterosexual men. In all the subgroups the prevalence of high-risk sexual practices was high and the percentage of condom utilization was low. Frequency of exposure to different risk factors, such as injections, transfusions of blood or other fluids, surgical interventions, tattoos, consumption of alcohol and other psychoactive substances, acupuncture, and sexual preference and practices, was determined. HIV seropositivity for the group as a whole was associated with sexual relations with infected persons (OR = 3.96), active anal coitus (OR = 3.81), sexual relations with men (OR = 3.69), passive anal coitus (OR = 3.35), and sexual relations abroad (OR = 2.24). In men, HIV seropositivity was associated with anal coitus (OR = 4.0), homosexual relations (OR = 3.96), sexual relations with infected persons (OR = 3.75), and sexual relations abroad (OR = 1.88); in women there was an association with intravenous drug use (chi 2 = 10.72) and with sexual relations abroad (OR = 12.67)."

The present study was aimed at the identification of anti-HEV IgG in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), living in Russia and Belarus, an area of low anti-HEV prevalence with a moderate spread of HIV infection and AIDS. In Russia, 13 out of 117 HIV-infected patients (11.1%) were found to be anti-HEV seropositive. This differed significantly from the frequency observed in the normal population (1.7%) but not from the frequency in a matching control, high-risk group consisting of male prisoners (8.0%). No difference in the frequency of anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was found between groups of HIV-infected men subdivided by sexual orientation. The rate of anti-HEV seropositivity increased with the progression of HIV infection, reaching 43.3% in AIDS patients and 38.1% in those who died from AIDS. In Belarus, anti-HEV IgG seropositivity was not found among 20 HIV-infected subjects nor among individuals from the control risk group, which consisted of 25 intravenous drug users. In conclusion, HEV infection may have common transmission mechanisms (risk factors) with HIV infection rather than represent an additional opportunistic infection in AIDS."

(WHO/CDC) definition of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported in the U.K., of which 54 were in persons who came to the U.K. for diagnosis and treatment and 1173 in U.K. residents. In the same period there were 8003 laboratory reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive tests. The upward trend in the number of AIDS cases by quarter changed in the last quarter of 1987, when there were only 163 new reports. Predictions were revised so that 1450 new reports are expected in 1988. During a temporary increase in the number of tests performed in the first quarter of 1987, associated with a publicity campaign, the testing threshold for members of the homosexual/bisexual male risk group fell. The proportion of HIV antibody positive homosexual/bisexual men who were ill when tested in 1985 was between 50 and 73 each quarter; after 1985, this proportion has varied between 38 and 49%. The concentration of AIDS cases in the four Thames regions was marked, whereas HIV antibody-positive reports were more widely distributed. Since 1985, the proportion of the total HIV antibody-positive reports from the Thames-regions increased from less than a half to two-thirds. Among HIV antibody-positive women, over half were IV drug abusers and over two-thirds were in the age group 15-29 years. There were 19 cases of AIDS in children aged 14 years or less, eight of which were in visitors to the U.K. Of the 11 cases in U.K. residents, seven were in children of mothers known to have, or to be at risk of, HIV infection. The distribution of the 253 HIV antibody-positive reports in children was different; most were in haemophiliacs or blood/components recipients aged 5-14 years. Most mothers who have infected their children in utero were either IV drug abusers or sexual partners of IV drug abusers. Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia was the commonest indicator disease at the time of diagnosing AIDS in children. The mean age at diagnosis was 2 years 4 months for those infected in utero and 3 years 7 months for those otherwise infected. Between 1985 and 1987 there were marked increases of children with AIDS, of HIV antibody-positive children of infected/at-risk mothers and of reported HIV infections in women of child-bearing age. In the near future it is likely that many more pregnancies, particularly in Scotland, will be complicated by HIV infection."

This study tested 1,206 sera collected from patients aged 1-25 years from various health facilities across the country for HBV serological markers and HBV DNA. Based on the year the vaccine was introduced, samples were stratified by age into pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations, which were then compared for evidence of immunity and chronic carriage using the Chi-square test. Where HIV status was known, subset analyses were performed. Immunity to HBV infection increased from 13.0% in the pre- to 57.0% in the post-vaccine introduction population (P < 0.001). This decreased with increasing age within the post-vaccine introduction population (76.1% for 1-5 years, 50.0% for 6-10 years, and 46.3% for 11-16 years). In addition, HBV chronic carriage was significantly (P = 0.003) reduced in the post- (1.4%) compared to the pre-vaccine introduction population (4.2%). The difference in prevalence of active HBV infection in the serologically exposed pre- and post-vaccine introduction populations was not statistically significant. Subset analyses showed that evidence of immunity was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in the HIV negative compared to the HIV positive subset in both populations. Universal hepatitis B vaccination has been a remarkable success, with a significant increase in immunity to HBV infection. The observation that HBV chronic carriage increases as immunity wanes over time calls into question whether the time has come to consider a pre-adolescence vaccine booster dose policy."
6286,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Hope for a cure for HIV-1 infection was dampened by the discovery of a latent form of the virus that persists in resting CD4+ cells. This reservoir of latently HIV-infected resting memory T cells represents an archive of viral genotypes produced in an individual from the onset of infection. Entry into the reservoir is stopped with suppressive antiretroviral therapy, but the archived viruses are capable of re-initiating active infections, are released continuously from this reservoir, and can cause viral rebound if antiretroviral therapy is stopped. Studies of residual low-level viremia (<50 HIV RNA copies/mL of plasma) in the setting of effective antiretroviral therapy indicate that such viremia is largely caused by activation of the latently infected cells and the release of virus from this and other stable reservoirs. These studies support the notion that the stability of the latent reservoir is consistent with the long life span of resting memory T cells, rather than reflecting rounds of active replication under suppressive antiretroviral therapy that replenish the reservoir. There may be other stable reservoirs in addition to the resting T-cells pool, further complicating the problem of eradication. This article summarizes a presentation on viral reservoirs and viral evolution by Robert F. Siliciano, MD, PhD, at the International AIDS Society-USA course in New York in March 2005."

GBV-C-infected patients exhibited a complete virological response to HAART more often than patients without [correction] GBV-C and had a greater increase in median CD4 cell count and a marginally greater median HIV RNA level decrease. This association was found to be independent of baseline CD4 cell count and plasma HIV RNA, which indicates that an association exists between GBV-C infection and response to HAART."

The aim of this analysis is to assess the relationship between GBV-C infection and response to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-infected subjects initiating HAART when antiretroviral-naive. A prospective, observational study of 400 HIV-infected patients with measurements of GBV-C RNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and HCV RNA determined from plasma stored prior to HAART initiation. Time to virological (achieving HIV RNA < or =500 copies/ml) and immunological success (a CD4+ count increase of > or =200 cells/microl), and the time to virological relapse (confirmed HIV RNA >500 copies/ml) were assessed by Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard regression model. Of the subjects, 117 (29.3%) were GBV-C positive and, overall, 351 (87.8%) patients achieved virological success. After controlling for a number of confounders including HCV RNA, GBV-C viraemic patients experienced a significantly lower risk of HIV rebound than those who were GBV-C negative [relative hazard (RH)=0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93, P=0.03]. Conversely, the probability of achieving initial virological success or CD4+ count response after HAART did not differ between GBV-C-negative and -positive subjects. These results suggest that GBV-C coinfection may play a role in determining the rate of HIV rebound possibly by competing with HIV replication after HIV load has been successfully suppressed by HAART."

The efficacy of an additional booster dose in children with immune recovery on HAART remains unknown. This study was conducted to determine the response rate of HBV antibody after re-vaccination in HIV-infected children with immune recovery on HAART. Sixty-three successfully HAART-treated HIV-infected children with history of prior HBV vaccination received 10microg doses of recombinant HBV vaccine (Government Pharmaceutical Organization-Merieux Biological Product, Bangkok, Thailand) intramuscularly at 0, 2 and 6 months. The vaccine response rates were 17.4, 82.5, and 92.1% at 2, 6 and 7 months after the first dose of vaccine, respectively. Plasma HIV RNA level below the limit of detection at the time of re-vaccination was associated with successful vaccine response. HIV-infected children with immune recovery after HAART are likely to benefit from three-dose HBV re-vaccination."

The number and patterns of mutations in the patients who exhibited discrepant responses to HAART did not differ from those observed in patients who exhibited immunologic and virologic failure to therapy. Results indicate that many patients have prolonged immunologic benefits, despite the development of virologic failure and protease inhibitor mutations. The clinical course of this group of patients calls into question the relevance of genotypic resistance and plasma human immunodeficiency virus RNA level as surrogate markers in patients receiving HAART."

It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."

Mortality was compared with that in the general population in the Netherlands matched by age and gender. Only log-transformed CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.61 per unit increase) and plasma viral load (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.60, HIV RNA level <100,000 vs. > or = 100,000 copies/mL) measured at 24 weeks and infection via intravenous drug use (IDU) (HR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.26, non-IDU vs. IDU) were significantly associated with progression to death.

In subjects without anti-HIV treatment, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level correlated with HLA-DR in CD4+ T cells, with Ki-67 in CD8+ T cells, and with expression of CD38 in both T cell subsets. A proportion of treated subjects had increased T cell activation despite 4 months of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). In subjects receiving HAART, a high percentage of HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells was associated with signs of opportunistic infections.

The 37 patients included had HIV plasma loads < 10,000 copies/ml, CD4(+) count > 250/microl. All the patients but two were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Liver tissue and sera were used for measurement of HCV RNA by the Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor. All patients had serum and liver HCV RNA, and both levels were correlated (r = 0.47; P = 0.003). Intrahepatic HCV load did not depend on age, sex, duration of HCV infection, CD4(+), HCV genotype, or fibrosis. AST levels correlated with intrahepatic HCV load (r = 0.52; P = 0.001). Patients with METAVIR A1/A2 had significantly lower levels of liver HCV-RNA than were found in patients with METAVIR A3 (P = 0.026). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including protease inhibitors(PI)-treated patients had significantly lower intrahepatic HCV load (P = 0.04). A weak but significant correlation between serum and liver HCV RNA was found. The amount of hepatic HCV RNA was correlated with AST levels, histological activity, but not with HCV genotype or fibrosis.

The effects of these polymorphisms may, in part, account for the differential pathogenesis of HIV-1 (immunosuppression) and SIV (natural resistance) in humans and non-human primates, respectively. Thus, understanding the genetic basis underlying species-specific responses to HIV-1 and SIV could reveal new anti-HIV-1 therapeutic strategies for humans. To this end, we compared CCR5 structure/evolution and regulation among humans, apes, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys. The evolution of the CCR5 cis-regulatory region versus the open reading frame as well as among different domains of the open reading frame differed from one another. CCR5 cis-regulatory region sequence variation in humans was substantially higher than anticipated. Based on this variation, CCR5 haplotypes could be organized into seven evolutionarily distinct human haplogroups (HH) that we designated HHA, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -G. HHA haplotypes were defined as ancestral to all other haplotypes by comparison to the CCR5 haplotypes of non-human primates. Different human and non-human primate CCR5 haplotypes were associated with differential transcriptional regulation, and various polymorphisms resulted in modified DNA-nuclear protein interactions, including altered binding of members of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors. We identified novel CCR5 untranslated mRNA sequences that were conserved in human and non-human primates. In some primates, mutations at exon-intron boundaries caused loss of expression of selected CCR5 mRNA isoforms or production of novel mRNA isoforms. Collectively, these findings suggest that the response to HIV-1 and SIV infection in primates may have been driven, in part, by evolution of the elements controlling CCR5 transcription and translation."
3636,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Deficiency in antioxidant micronutrients have been observed in patients with AIDS. These observations concerning only some isolated nutrients demonstrate a defect in zinc, selenium, and glutathione. An increase in free radical production and lipid peroxidation has been also found in these patients, and takes a great importance with recent papers presenting an immunodeficiency and more important an increase in HIV-1 replication secondary to free radicals overproduction. We have assessed different studies, trying to obtain a global view of the antioxidant status of these patients. In adults we observe a progressive decrease for zinc, selenium, and vitamin E with the severity of disease, except that selenium remains normal at stage II. However, the main dramatic decrease concerns carotenoids whose level at stage II is only half the normal value. To understand if these decreases in antioxidant and increases in oxidative stress occur secondary to the aggravation of the disease or, conversely, are responsible for it, we undertook a longitudinal survey of asymptotic patients. The preliminary results of this evaluation are presented. Paradoxically, lipid peroxidation is higher at stage II than at stage IV. This may be consecutive to a more intense overproduction of oxygen free radicals by more viable polymorphonuclear (PMN) at the asymptomatic stage. The free radicals production and lipid peroxidation seem secondary to a direct induction by the virus of PMN stimulation and cytokines secretion. N-Acetyl cysteine or ascorbate have been demonstrated in cell culture to be capable of blocking the expression of HIV-1 after oxidative stress and N-acetyl cysteine inhibits in vitro TNF-induced apoptosis of infected cells. In regard to all these experimental data, few serious and large trials of antioxidants have been conducted in HIV-infected patients, although some preliminary studies using zinc or selenium have been performed. In our opinion it is now time to evaluate in humans the beneficial effect of antioxidants. The more promising candidates for presenting synergistic effects when associated with N-acetyl cysteine seem to be beta-carotene, selenium and zinc."

A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "

Non-African-Americans were more likely to have osteopenia or osteoporosis (59%) compared to African-Americans (26%) (p = 0.09). The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (< 34 ng/ml) and elevated i-PTH (>65 pg/ml) was 79% and 20%, respectively. Higher mean urinary N-telopeptide levels were found in non-African-Americans [58 (34) nmol BCE/mmol] compared to African-Americans [41 (18) nmol BCE/mmol] (p = 0.09). Magnetic resonance imaging identified one African-American subject (3%) with bilateral asymptomatic hip osteonecrosis. Our findings suggest that the burden of metabolic bone disease in HIV+ patients with HAART-associated lipodystrophy may be greater in whites than in African-Americans. Studies to examine ethnic variations in bone metabolism are necessary to devise optimal interventions."

We investigated the frequency of the SDF-1-3'A, CCR2-64I, CCR5-D32 and CCR5-Promoter-59029-A/G polymorphisms in Brazilian HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals and their influence on CD4+ T-cell evolution HIV-1 infected individuals before and during HAART. Polymorphism detection was done in a transversal study of 200 HIV-1-infected and 82 uninfected individuals. The rate of CD4+ T cell increase or decrease was studied in a cohort of 155 HIV-1 infected individuals on pre and post-HAART. Polymorphisms were determined by PCR associated with RFLP. The rate of CD4+ T-cell decline or increase was also determined. HIV-1 infected and uninfected subjects showed, respectively, frequencies of 0.193 and 0.220 for SDF-1-3'A, of 0.140 and 0.110 for CCR2-V64I, of 0.038 and 0.055 for CCR5-D32, and of 0.442 and 0.390 for CCR5-P-59029-A/G. HIV-1-infected subjects carrying one, two or three of these four polymorphisms showed better CD4+ T-cell recovery than HIV-1-infected subjects carrying the four wild-type alleles (+2.7, +1.6, +3.5, and -0.9 lymphocytes/microl/month, respectively). Regression logistic analysis showed that the CCR5-D32/CCR2-V64I association was predictor of positive CD4+ T cell slope after HAART. The distribution of polymorphisms did not differ between HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals, but differed from more homogenous ethnic groups probably reflecting the miscegenation of the Brazilian population. We add further evidence of the role of these polymorphisms by showing that the CD4 gain was influenced by carriage of one or more of the polymorphisms studied here. These results highlight the possibility that these genetic traits can be useful to identify patients at risk for faster progression to AIDS or therapeutic failure."

During the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003, a total of 285,946 clinical specimens were submitted to this laboratory, which confirmed 310 cases of acute HBV and 7,556 cases of chronic HBV infection. A total of 18,168 individuals were identified as having vaccine-induced immune status. The incidence rate of acute HBV infection has significantly decreased from 6.52/100,000 person-years in 1996 to 0.86/100,000 person-years in 2003. Annual prevalence rates of chronic HBV infection in Manitoba increased slightly from 42.96 cases/100,000 population in 1992 to 71.47 cases/100,000 population in 2003. Incidence rates were generally higher in men than in women at all age groups, with values of 2.65 and 1.65 per 100,000 population, respectively (chi-square=15.768, p value <0.001). The highest incidence rate for both males and females was observed in the age group 30-34 years. The North Eastman and Winnipeg Regional Health Authorities showed significantly higher incidence rates of acute hepatitis B compared with the other nine Regional Health Authorities. Selective hepatitis B vaccination programs for children in Manitoba had achieved the greatest success in the prevention of vertical and horizontal transmission. There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective harm-reduction strategies for hepatitis B prevention among adults (aged 30-34) and groups at risk in Manitoba."

To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."

We found that prolonged treatment of late-stage HIV-1-infected patients with a protease inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors failed to restore sustained, high levels of HIV-1-specific, HLA class I-restricted, cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte precursors and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by CD8(+) T cells. In some patients, particularly those initiating three-drug combination therapy simultaneously rather than sequentially, there were early, transient increases in the frequency of anti-HIV-1 CD8(+) T cells that correlated with decreases in HIV-1 RNA and increases in T-cell counts. In the other patients, HIV-1-specific T-cell functions either failed to increase or declined from baseline during triple-drug therapy, even though some of these patients showed suppression of plasma HIV-1 RNA. These effects of combination therapy were not unique to HIV-1 specific T-cell responses, since similar effects were noted for CD8(+) T cells specific for the cytomegalovirus pp65 matrix protein. The level and breadth of CD8(+) cell reactivity to HLA A*02 HIV-1 epitopes, as determined by IFN-gamma production and HLA tetramer staining after combination therapy, were related to the corresponding responses prior to treatment. There was, however, a stable, residual population of potentially immunocompetent HIV-1-specific T cells remaining after therapy, as shown by tetramer staining of CD8(+) CD45RO(+) cells. These results indicate that new strategies will be needed to target residual, immunocompetent HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cells to enhance the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in patients with advanced immunodeficiency."

Mutations in the precore region of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome are frequently found in hepatitis B envelope antigen-negative cases. Data from India on the HBV genotype-associated distribution of precore mutations are limited. Our objective in this study was to genotype and detect the precore mutant with a point mutation from G to A at nucleotide 1896 using ligase chain reaction (LCR) and direct sequencing. A total of 115 cases of chronic liver disease were screened. The cases were evaluated on the basis of history, clinical examination, liver function profile, and serological test for HBV infection, which includes HBsAg, anti HBcIgG, HBeAg using commercially available ELISA kits. The cases, which were HBeAg+, HBeAg-, and HBV DNA+, were subjected to LCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. Of 115 chronic liver disease cases, 50 (43.5%) cases were HBV DNA positive. All cases were subjected to LCR; 11 (22%) cases confirmed the presence of precore mutants, while the remaining 39 (78%) were classified as the wild form of the virus. HBV genotyping by direct sequencing revealed that genotype D was predominant in both wild and mutant forms of the virus. We conclude that the HBV genotype distribution was not significantly different between precore mutants and the wild form of the virus (P>0.05). North Indian patients with genotype D were more likely to have persistent HBV infection with precore mutants. HBV genotypes correlate with the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection."

Previous studies using higher, weight-based ribavirin dosing report that patients carrying polymorphisms encoding reduced predicted ITPase activity show decreased risk of ribavirin-induced anemia but increased risk of thrombocytopenia, with no impact on elimination of virus. In all, 354 treatment-naïve HCV genotype 2/3-infected patients, enrolled in a phase III trial (NORDynamIC), were genotyped for ITPA (rs1127354 and rs7270101). Homo- or heterozygosity at Ars1127354 or Crs7270101 , entailing reduced ITPase activity, was observed in 37% of patients and was associated with increased likelihood of achieving sustained virological response (SVR) (P = 0.0003 in univariate and P = 0.0002 in multivariate analyses) accompanied by a reduced risk of relapse among treatment-adherent patients. The association between ITPA variants and SVR remained significant when patients were subdivided by the 12- and 24-week treatment duration arms, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage, and IL28B genotype, and was not secondary to improved adherence to therapy or less pronounced anemia. Gene variants predicting reduced predicted ITPase activity were also associated with decreased risk of anemia (P < 0.0001), increased risk of thrombocytopenia (P = 0.007), and lower ribavirin concentrations (P = 0.02)."

The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) in OHL of HIV+ Venezuelan patients. We evaluated 21 HIV+ adult patients with clinically present OHL lesions: 11 under antiretroviral therapy, 10 without therapy, and 10 oral mucosal samples as controls. Nested-PCR was used to detect EBV and HPV infection. The INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping v2 was applied to determine the HPV genotype. The EBV genome was found in 16/21 (76%) of the HIV+ patients with OHL. No difference was observed in EBV+ and EBV- patients related to antiretroviral therapy viral load and CD4+ Tcell coant. HPV-DNA was observed in 7/21 HIV positive cases (33%). The HPV genotypes detected were: 6, 11, 31, 33, 52, and 56/74. The most frequently HPV found was genotype 6 in 7/7, while two cases were HPV-11 and two HPV-52. Of the positive cases, 5/7 (71%) presented co-infection with more than one HPV genotype and 4/7 (57%) had HPV coinfection with high and low risk types. No case was EBV or HPV positive in the control group. In this study, a higher EBV prevalence was observed in OHL-HIV+ patients, confirming the etiologic role in this entity. A considerable number of cases were positive for HPV infection, and many patients presented coinfection with more than one HPV genotype as well as the presence of high oncogenic risk HPV in OHL."

We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease.

The HBV genotypes and sequences of the precore/BCP regions were determined in 180 HBV/HCV dually-infected patients and were compared with 90 age, sex and hepatitis B e antigen-matched chronic hepatitis B controls. Serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were assessed every 3-6 months after therapy with IFN or pegylated-IFN plus ribavirin in 135 dually-infected patients with active hepatitis C. Dually-infected patients had a higher prevalence of genotype C HBV (P=0.022) and a lower frequency of G1896A mutation (P=0.004) as compared with controls. Among dually-infected patients, genotype C was associated with a higher frequency of A1762T/G1764A mutation (P<0.001), but with lower HBV DNA (P<0.001) and a lower frequency of A1752T/G (P=0.008), C1799G (P<0.001) and G1896A mutation (P<0.001) than genotype B. Based on Cox proportional hazards model, young age (hazard ratio (HR)=0.952, P=0.001), sustained virological response to HCV (HR=4.638, P=0.044), C1766T mutation (HR=5.216, P=0.003) and A1846T mutation (HR=2.332, P=0.031) correlated with HBV DNA reactivation (⩾2000IU/ml) after therapy.

ELISA test was used to detect anti-HBc, anti-HBs and HBsAg. We found that 30 out of 90 (33.3%) patients were PCR-RT-PCR positive for HCV-RNA. No HBV-DNA (0%) was detected through the PCR study in both positive and negative HCV-RNA patient groups. Though none of the samples was HBsAg positive, 10 (33.3%) HCV-RNA positive patients were anti-HBc positive, and 12 (40.7%) were anti-HBs positive.

Viral evolution in the presence of antiviral therapy needs to be considered when developing new therapeutic strategies. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences can be used for this purpose but may give rise to misleading results if rates of intrapatient evolution differ significantly. To improve analyses of HIV-1 evolution relevant to studies of pathogenesis and treatment, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates all available sequence data while simultaneously allowing the phylogenetic parameters of each patient to vary. We used this method to examine evolutionary changes in HIV-1 coreceptor usage in response to treatment. We examined patients whose viral populations exhibited a shift in coreceptor utilization in response to therapy. CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated. By phylogenetically reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of HIV-1 obtained longitudinally from each patient, it was possible to examine the origin of the reemergent R5 virus. Using our Bayesian hierarchical approach, we found that the reemergent R5 virus detectable after therapy was more closely related to the predecessor R5 virus than to the X4 strains. The Bayesian hierarchical approach, unlike more traditional methods, makes it possible to evaluate competing hypotheses across patients. This model is not limited to analyses of HIV-1 but can be used to elucidate evolutionary processes for other organisms as well."

The risk for CVD is purported to be even higher among people with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection because of the increased inflammatory response, which may synergistically impact CVD risk. However, studies comparing CVD outcomes between HIV alone and HIV/HCV individuals have been discordant. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify and quantify the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and the risk for CVD. We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to December 2016 to identify studies that provided information on HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD, defined as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and stroke. We used a random-effects model to abstract and pool data on the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD. HRs were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and LDL cholesterol. Among the 283 articles reviewed, four cohort studies met inclusion criteria with a total of 33 723 participants.

Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli.

The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy.

This was of interest because CD8+ cells contribute to immunologic control of both infections, but the usual outcome of EBV infection is benign, whereas untreated HIV infection is fatal. During acute EBV infection, CD8+ cells expressed elevated levels of the activation antigens CD38 and HLA-DR, similar to that during chronic HIV infection. Within 16 weeks, when EBV latency is established, CD8+ cell activation had resolved. In contrast, activation persists in HIV infection. Expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD8+ cells could be a marker for ongoing viral replication in both infections. Other CD8+ cell alterations observed in this study of acute EBV infection included increases in both CD62L- and CD62L+ CD8+ cells and unique kinetics in the expansion of the CD57+CD8+ cell subset."

However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV variants is a barrier to successful use of HAART, with resistance to one drug often resulting in cross-resistance to many, if not all, others in the same class. The rise in the incidence of drug-resistant variants among newly infected patients also represents a formidable challenge for clinicians. Failure of the current HAART regimen due to drug resistance can severely limit second-line, third-line, and salvage treatment options. Although inadequate exposure of the virus to antiretroviral agents is a prime reason for the emergence of HIV drug-resistant variants, poor adherence to complicated regimens and variability in drug pharmacokinetics (PK), both within and between HIV-infected individuals, can also affect the overall efficacy of antiretroviral agents, promoting emergence of resistant HIV variants. Recent strategies to optimize antiretroviral drug regimens, including assessment of HIV genotype and/or phenotype, the use of protease inhibitor regimens that incorporate PK boosting, and scheduled treatment interruptions, have been explored. Additionally, several newer antiretroviral agents that produce rapid and sustained virologic and immunologic responses as well as novel resistance profiles (e.g. atazanavir and tenofovir) have become available. These characteristics thus increase the likelihood of durable viral suppression."

As such, mapping the details of cell type-specific degradation of immune function as a consequence of changes to signaling network responses has not been readily accessible. We used a flow cytometric-based assay of signaling to determine Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak/STAT) signaling changes at the single-cell level within distinct cell subsets from the primary immune cells of HIV-1-infected donors. We identified a specific defect in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-driven Stat5 phosphorylation in the monocytes of HIV-1+ donors. This inhibition was statistically significant in a cohort of treated and untreated individuals. Ex vivo Stat5 phosphorylation levels varied among HIV-1+ donors but did not correlate with CD4(+) T-cell counts or HIV-1 plasma viral load. Low Stat5 activation occurred in HIV-1-infected donors despite normal GM-CSF receptor levels. Investigation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, also stimulated by GM-CSF, led to the observation that lipopolysaccharide-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation is enhanced in monocytes. Thus, we have identified a specific, imbalanced monocyte signaling profile, with inhibition of STAT and enhancement of MAPK signaling, associated with HIV-1 infection. This understanding of altered monocyte signaling responses that contribute to defective antigen presentation during HIV-1 infection could lead to immunotherapeutic approaches that compensate for the deficiency."

Moreover the results from peptide ELISA also showed that a low CD4 cell count was related to a low anti-Tat antibody (p < 0.05), which may be due to the progression of HIV-1, which can be found predominantly in AIDS patients. The results of nested PCR showed that the second Tat exon might also play a role in T-cell activation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure HIV-1 mRNA expression in PBMC. RT-PCR negative results were found mostly in the asymptomatic HIV-seropositive group (88%). HIV-1 mRNA expression was found to correlate with current immunologic status. The differences in Tat protein sequences from DNA sequencing between the patients who had anti-Tat antibody positive and anti-Tat antibody negative, were not significant (p > 0.05). These results suggested that the Tat amino acid sequences were conserved among each group of samples and did not change significantly compared with the consensus sequence in previous studies.

Clinicians have had to deal with new and difficult opportunistic infections. Yet advances in the treatment and prevention of these illnesses have benefited many AIDS victims. In the United States, the AIDS epidemic is now concentrating in the inner cities, involving injection drug users, minorities, heterosexuals, women and their offspring. In the developing world, AIDS continues to be predominantly a heterosexually transmitted disease, where more than one third of prostitutes in central African cities are infected. The major burden of the AIDS epidemic in the remainder of this and the next century will be in India and Southeast Asia, again predominantly via heterosexual spread. A great deal is now understood concerning the life cycle of HIV. More light has been shed on the interaction of HIV and CD4+ T cells, the cellular and viral factors involved in viral expression vs. latency, the function of the viral regulatory and structural proteins and the role of cytokines in regulation of HIV expression. Our understanding of the precise mechanisms whereby HIV causes a loss of CD4+ T cells remains incomplete. The direct infection and cell killing of CD4+ T cells is important and is supported by recent evidence demonstrating a high viral burden in these cells in the lymphoid tissue of patients. Over the last 1 to 2 years, there has been new evidence for indirect mechanisms of CD4+ T-cell depletion and/or dysfunction including: autoimmune reactions, perturbations of specific V beta T-cell receptor populations, infection of T-cell precursors in bone marrow and thymus, immunosuppression and dysregulation by viral proteins, possible super-antigen effects, and antigen-induced apoptosis or programmed cell death. New information has come forth in our understanding of B-cell abnormalities in HIV pathogenesis, including the putative role of IL-6 in B-cell activation and the identification of EBV in B-cell lymphomas in the CNS of patients with AIDS. It is expected that these and future discoveries concerning immunopathogenesis of HIV infection will help steer the therapeutic effort.

Recent studies have shown that low-cost regimens can prevent some of the most important causes of HIV-related disease in African countries. Isoniazid preventive therapy can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis; priorities are to seek opportunities for implementation, to assess effectiveness under operational conditions, and to monitor its effect on resistance patterns. Cotrimoxazole was shown to be highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among individuals with symptomatic HIV disease in Côte d'Ivoire, and should be implemented where it is likely to be of benefit. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was disappointingly ineffective among HIV-infected Ugandan adults, but newer conjugate vaccines are becoming available that should be investigated. The benefit of these preventive regimens to the individual may be modest when compared with the effect of antiretroviral therapy. However, simple preventive therapies could reach a much wider population than is immediately feasible for expensive and complex antiretroviral regimens, and thus have the potential for substantial benefit at the population level. The availability of effective and affordable regimens to prevent HIV-related disease may also encourage people to seek HIV testing, combat denial, and help overcome the sense of powerlessness in countries where the HIV epidemic has hit hardest."

HIV infection has changed into a chronic infection with the chance of developing long-term complications. Vascular complications are frequently reported in the current literature. HIV and treatment by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) are associated with many cardiovascular risk factors. An increased risk of arterial cardiovascular complications was found in a number of studies. However, data about the risk of venous thrombotic disease (VTE), including potentially fatal conditions as pulmonary embolism, were limited. In a systematic review of the literature, ten relevant epidemiological studies were identified that investigated the risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients. The incidence was increased two- to tenfold in comparison with a healthy population of the same age. However, these studies were mainly retrospective cohort studies that were prone to selection bias, confounding factors were not always mentioned and in all but three control populations were missing. An increased risk of venous thrombotic disease in HIV-infected patients could be explained by the presence of a hypercoagulable state, characterised by an increase in procoagulant factors, such as endothelial TF expression and thrombogenic properties of microparticles, and a decrease in anticoagulant factors, including AT III, HC II and the protein C pathway. Furthermore, the risk of VTE was associated with an increased risk of infections and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and was weakly associated with HAART. All together, quite some evidence pointed towards a relationship between HIV infection and venous thrombotic disease, but the association still needs to be established in properly designed epidemiological studies."

Because the immune reconstitution that accompanies antiretroviral therapy may change some of these features and because most cases of HIV- 1 infection occur in resource-poor settings of the world where access to antiretroviral agents is limited, we compared PD among patients with and without HIV-1 infection in a North American population before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The records of all pneumococcal cultures processed at this medical center over a period of 20 months were used to identify patients with invasive PD. Hospital records were reviewed for 103 of these patients (52 with and 51 without HIV-1 infection) and demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and microbiologic information was abstracted and subsequently analyzed. Despite similarities in presenting signs and symptoms, we found a higher incidence of bacteremia but a more favorable outcome with less frequent requirements for intubation and admission to intensive care units and better survival among individuals with HIV infection. Factors such as less advanced age, the presence of fewer comorbid conditions, or a less florid inflammatory response among HIV-infected individuals may account for differences in outcome of invasive PD."

However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."

Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."

We report a 28-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected bisexual man who had multiple invasive SCC of the fingers, infected with the rare type HPV 26. Classification of HPV 26 as high- or intermediate-risk type has been uncertain, due to its rare presence in cervical cancer. Despite successful treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the patient developed extensive hyperkeratotic nailbed proliferations of all fingers. Tumours were refractory to treatment and invaded into adjacent tissues. X-rays of the hands demonstrated bone invasion, necessitating amputation of distal phalanges of several fingers. Histologically, highly differentiated preinvasive and invasive verrucous SCCs were identified. Molecular DNA typing identified HPV 26 in the SCCs and in some premalignant lesions. By in situ hybridization HPV 26 DNA was detected in numerous tumour cells, indicating productive infection with high-level amplification of the viral genome. In the remaining proliferations, high-risk HPV type 58, cutaneous HPVs and a putative new HPV type were identified. HPV 26 infection appears to be causally involved in the development of SCC of the nail unit in this immunosuppressed patient. Timely evaluation of chronic verrucous nailbed tumours is recommended, especially in immunocompromised patients. Identification of HPV 26, besides known high-risk HPV types, may identify patients at risk for developing SCC of the nailbed and possibly at other locations."

A total of 389 whites and 135 nonwhites started receiving HAART before 1 April 2001. After 1 year of treatment, 78% of nonwhites and 76% of whites achieved a virus load of <500 HIV RNA copies/mL. No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count.

Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation."

Treatments of chronic HBV infection by antiviral drugs are costly and outcome of treatment is also restricted. Therefore risk factors identification is the logical & rational approach to prevent HBV infection. This case control study aimed to find out certain risk factors related to HBV infection in children. It was conducted on patients attending the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition and Department of Virology of BSMMU and Khidmah Hospital, Dhaka. A total of one hundred cases and one hundred suitably matched controls were studied between October 2007 to May 2009.Variables used for the purpose of the study were younger age,  use of mosquito nets, history of undergoing surgical procedures, history of taking intravenous drug and blood transfusion, maternal infection, dental procedures and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops. Chi-square test   was done to measure the level of significance. Odds ratio was calculated to correlate the disease risk. Backward conditional logistic regression was also done for multivariate analysis. The study result showed that the frequency of HBV infection among the study population was higher (62.0%) among children of 7 to 12 years age group. In younger age group (0-6 years) prevalence was 18.0%. Respondents who did not use mosquito net during sleep on a regular basis had higher risk of developing HBV infection than those who used it regularly (p value 0.028). Children who underwent surgical procedures for any reason were significantly associated with HBV infection (p value 0.005). Intravenous drug use (p value 0.001), mother to child transmission (p value 0.001) and history of abrasion during hair cut in barber shops (p value 0.04) were also identified as significant risk factors. No significant association was observed with blood transfusion (p value 0.138) and dental procedures (p value 0.315). From this study it may be concluded that irregular use of mosquito nets, history of surgical procedures, history of parenteral medication, transmission from infected mothers and abrasion during hair cut in barber shops are the probable important risk factors of HBV infection in children."
4109,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Liver disease is currently the second leading cause of death in HIV-infected persons in Western countries. Hepatitis C virus infection accounts for the majority of cases of hepatic illness in this population. Although great progress has been made in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV-positive patients, many challenges still remain unsolved. The combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current treatment of choice in hepatitis C virus/HIV-coinfected patients, regardless of hepatitis C virus genotype. However, the limited efficacy of this therapy in the HIV setting makes necessary the development of new strategies and/or drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Several anti-hepatitis C virus compounds are currently under investigation, although most are still in the early stages of clinical development. There is a relatively large group of patients who will be unable to be treated with the current hepatitis C virus medication based on interferon, mainly due to contraindications such as serious neuropsychiatric or cardiovascular history. However, for those without contraindications, treatment should be provided with no restrictions at the start (e.g. asking unnecessarily for a liver biopsy), and reassessed at weeks 4 and 12, considering virologic responses. Treatment should only be continued in early virologic responders. The use of standard doses of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day) and for at least 12 months seems crucial to maximize the effect of current hepatitis C treatment in the HIV setting, while no further benefit seems to derive from using higher than recommended pegylated interferon dosages. In patients with rapid virologic response (undetectable viremia at week 4) to anti-hepatitis C therapy, shorter periods of therapy (24 weeks) may be advisable in hepatitis C genotypes 2 and 3. Finally, adequate selection of candidates and careful selection of concomitant antiretroviral medications must be encouraged. Patients with low CD4 percentages (< 15%) should be deferred for treatment and HAART prioritized in order to improve CD4 counts. When possible, nucleoside analogs such as zidovudine, stavudine, and abacavir should be replaced by others having no deleterious interactions with ribavirin (e.g. tenofovir, lamivudine, or emtricitabine). Didanosine should never be coadministered with ribavirin due to potential life-threatening complications."

The 10 infants born at 37 weeks of gestation or earlier were at higher risk of HIV-1 infection than infants born at 38 weeks of gestation or later (60% vs 22%) but the median age at appearance of disease was approximately 5 months in both groups. The HIV-1 transmission rate was not associated with predelivery levels of maternal T cells, anti-p24, or neutralising antibodies but it was higher, among full-term infants, for those with mothers in the lowest third of the distribution of anti-gp120 levels (53%). On immunoblot, transmitting mothers lacked a gp120 band but not other bands. Protection was not associated with antibody to recombinant peptides from the hypervariable region of the major neutralising gp120 epitope, and the anti-gp120 endpoint dilution titre was similar in transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. Mothers of uninfected full-term infants appear to confer immunological protection against HIV-1 infection of their offspring by way of a high-affinity antibody to a gp120 epitope, whose specificity has importance for vaccine development and possibly perinatal immunotherapy."

Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
6351,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "

This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."

Data were collected using a validated questionnaire. One-hundred-and-fourteen physiotherapists in Durban hospitals participated in the study. Seventy-two per cent of the questionnaires met the criteria for analysis. Ninety per cent of the participants believed that they knew about HIV/AIDS, but only 78% could identify all viral transmission modes. Of the 38 physiotherapists who believed that they knew the stages of an HIV infection, only 11% actually knew the stages, 28% could not explain them and 61% were vaguely aware. Fifty-six per cent of the respondents had treated patients who had died from HIV/AIDS. Only 38% of physiotherapists were completely at ease when treating HIV/AIDS patients despite the fact that 98% believed that physiotherapy was an integral component of the management of an AIDS patient. Fifty-one per cent of the respondents were unaware of support structures provided by their employers. The authors conclude that the perceptions of physiotherapists about their knowledge about HIV/AIDS do not stand up to scrutiny. Significantly more attention should be paid to the development, implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of educational programmes on HIV/AIDS for physiotherapists in the workplace."

Results obtained with other HIV-1 markers for this purpose are often inconsistent. This study examined the relationship between various HIV-1 markers by using clinical specimens (plasma) from HIV-1-infected individuals at different stages of disease progression and supernatant fluid from four human T-lymphocyte cell lines chronically infected with HIV-1. Cell culture specimens were collected periodically over 7 days and were tested for HIV-1 RNA levels with a nucleic acid amplification assay, for p24 with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and for reverse transcriptase activity by isotope uptake. An increase in the level of each marker was observed over the 7-day period with each of the four HIV-1 strains tested (LAV1, HTLV-IIIB, MN, and ARV2); with these specimens, the frequency of detection for each marker was 100%. In the clinical specimens, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (143 of 183 specimens [78%]) than was p24 (87 of 183 [48%]); little correlation between the levels of the two markers was seen. In these clinical specimens evaluated, CD4(+)-cell counts were better correlated with the frequency and levels of HIV-1 RNA than with p24. In specimens (n = 38) collected serially from six HIV-1-infected subjects, HIV-1 RNA was detected more often (33 of 38 [85%]) than p24 (23 of 38 [59%]). When reported by the assays used, the levels of both HIV-1 markers fluctuated over time for each of the subjects. Although the markers correlated in the in vitro systems studied, the observed differences in the correlation of levels and frequencies of HIV-1 markers in vivo indicate that p24 has less clinical utility than does viral load testing when used in conjunction with CD4(+)-cell counts as a measure of immune system functioning."

Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
4988,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient."

Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."

When the ACTG 175 and Delta trials demonstrated the clinical improvement offered by regiments combining 2 nucleosides over monotherapy, combination therapy was being prescribed for less than 20% of all primary infections. Less than one year later, this rate suddenly rose to 90%. At the same time, the clinical benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality was demonstrated for triple therapy and by the end of 1997, 65% of all treated HIV+ patients were taking the triple combination therapy, 34% were on bitherapy and only 1% on single drug regimens. This fantastically rapid evolution of management strategies appears even more exceptional when one realizes that these changes in prescription attitudes took place before expert groups were able to establish accepted guidelines. The number of patients under treatment also rose sharply from 57% in early 1994 to 87% in late 1997, while the number of active hospital files rose by 30%. These rapid changes in patient management schemes has had a major effect on HIV-related morbidity and mortality. In 1997, the number of deaths fell by 41% and the number of new AIDS cases by nearly 50%. The number of hospitalizations has also declined by 50% over the last 2 years. This is probably the first time in the history in medicine that preliminary clinical studies have led to direct patient benefit in so short a time. This achievement has been accomplished by the combined efforts of health care workers, patient associations, public authorities and the pharmaceutical industry. This global view must not however hide the fact that most all the prescriptions used today are based on the results of clinical trials in a small number of patients over short study periods. Long-term efficacy and tolerance remain unknown. One must also keep in mind one other figure which has not varied over this period. The percentage of new AIDS cases in patients no ith no prior treatment because they are unaware of the infection or because they do not want treatment remains unchanged at 40%."

In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."

Each virus incriminated accounts for a particular type of vasculitis. HEPATITIS B VIRAL INFECTION (HBV): Is the cause of polyarteritis nodosa in 36 to 50% of cases. The onset of the symptomatology is acute, usually within a few months following the infection; it is comparable to that observed in the absence of HBV infection. CRYOGLOBULINEMIA RELATED TO THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV): The clinical manifestations are those of systemic vasculitis with particular tropism for the skin (involvement generally inaugural and almost constant), peripheral nerves and the glomerula. They occur fairly late during the infection. VASCULITIS ASSOCIATED WITH HIV INFECTION: There is strong tropism for the peripheral (multi-neuritis) and central nervous system. During acute parvovirus B19 infection Vasculitis lesions have occasionally been reported following the viremic phase, generally limited to one or several flares of vascular purpura predominating on the lower limbs. FOLLOWING VARICELLA-HERPES ZOSTER INFECTION: Vasculitis occasionally develops in the form of a central neurological deficiency (locomotor deficiency with or without aphasia around one month after an ophthalmologic herpes zoster) or involving the retina or, more rarely, the skin or the kidneys.

7734,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Cancers associated with immunosuppression and infections have long been recognized as a major complication of HIV/AIDS. More recently, persons living with HIV are increasingly diagnosed with a wider spectrum of HIV-associated malignancies (HIVAM) as they live longer on combination antiretroviral therapy. This has spurred research to characterize the epidemiology and determine the optimal management of HIVAM with a focus on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given background coinfections, environmental exposures, host genetic profiles, antiretroviral therapy usage, and varying capacities for early diagnosis and treatment, one can expect the biology of cancers in HIV-infected persons in LMICs to have a significant impact on chronic HIV care, as is now the case in high-income countries. Thus, new strategies must be developed to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat HIVAM in LMICs; provide physical/clinical infrastructures; train the cancer and HIV workforce; and expand research capacity-particularly given the challenges posed by the limitations on available transportation and financial resources and the population's general rural concentration. Opportunities exist to extend resources supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to improve the health-care infrastructure and train the personnel required to prevent and manage cancers in persons living with HIV. These HIV chronic care infrastructures could also serve cancer patients regardless of their HIV status, facilitating long-term care and treatment for persons who do not live near cancer centers, so that they receive the same degree of care as those receiving chronic HIV care today."

Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."

HIV seroprevalence in STD clinics ranged from 0 to 38.5% (median, 2.3%), with the highest rates found in the Mid-Atlantic states, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The highest median rates were found in men who have sex with men (36.1%) and heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users (4.1%). For heterosexual persons who do not report IV drug use, median rates were highest in the 35- to 39-year-old age group for men (6.4%) and the 30- to 34-year-old age group for women (0.9%). Among persons who do not report risk behaviors for HIV infection, men had substantially higher median rates of HIV infection than women (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test), and rates were positively correlated with HIV infection rates in IV drug users in the same clinic (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.8; P less than 0.001). Among heterosexual STD clinic patients who do not report IV drug use, the median HIV infection rate for blacks (1.8%) was at least 2 times higher than the median infection rates for hispanics (0.9%) and whites (0.7%). The results of this study show that HIV infection in STD clinic patients varies by geographic area, sex, race and ethnic group, and risk behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Recent findings by our group demonstrated a direct association between HIV-1 infection and hematopoietic progenitor cell health in Botswana. Therefore, using a single-colony infection assay and quantitative proviral analysis, we examined whether HIV-1C could infect hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and whether this phenotype was associated with the higher rates of anemia found in southern Africa. The results show that a significant number of HIV-1C, but not HIV-1B, isolates can infect HPCs in vitro (P < .05). In addition, a portion of HIV-1C-positive Africans had infected progenitor cell populations in vivo, which was associated with higher rates of anemia in these patients (P < .05). This represents a difference in cell tropism between 2 geographically separate and distinct HIV-1 subtypes. The association of this hematotropic phenotype with higher rates of anemia should be considered when examining anti-HIV drug treatment regimens in HIV-1C-predominant areas, such as southern Africa."

Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants."

Four histologic patterns were seen on biopsy: explosive follicular hyperplasia (EFH), follicular involution (FI), a mixed pattern of EFH with FI in the same node, and lymphocyte depletion. Patients with FI and lymphocyte depletion had mean survival times that were significantly less than those for the subjects with EFH. The percentage of lymph node follicles with suppressor cell clusters (T8) in EFH lymph nodes was significantly higher (43% vs 8%) than in nodes from patients without risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. Helper/suppressor T-cell ratios in control nodes were 1.6; in EFH nodes, 0.97; and in FI nodes, 0.88. A remarkable 33% of patients in this lymphadenopathy group ultimately developed large-cell (B-cell) lymphoma, suggesting that the follicular stimulation noted histologically played a role in the development of this neoplasm. These data show that there is a progressive destruction of lymph node follicles that correlates with the progression of the disease and that lymph node histologic features may provide important prognostic information."

To understand better this association, we have investigated p55 and p75 TNF-R expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets and in the promonocytic cell line U937, with or without HIV infection. Using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies both to sTNF-R and to PBMC subsets, TNF-R were found to be expressed mostly by monocytes and in decreasing amounts and intensity in the following order: CD14+ cells > CD8+ cells > CD4+ cells. Expression of TNF-R was higher on cells obtained from HIV-infected than from noninfected subjects, and expression of p75 sTNF-R was much higher than that of p55 sTNF-R. Studying the U937 cells revealed that over 80% of the cells expressed both sTNF-R, but with greater fluorescence intensity in the HIV-1 chronically infected cells (U-937-IIIB). Treatment of the cells with PMA caused an accelerated release into the medium of both sTNF-R, with a sharp decline in their cell surface expression. Basal levels of mRNA transcripts for p75 TNF-R were higher in the U-937-IIIB cells than in the uninfected cells, but p55 TNF-R mRNA was expressed only in the HIV-1-infected cells. These findings show that HIV-1 infection is accompanied by predominant elevation of p75 TNF-R surface expression on monocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes, and results in both increased message and expression of these receptors in monocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Using cell culture and animal models, we showed that HNF4alpha supports HBV replication in nonhepatic cells and HNF3beta inhibits HBV replication. However, the expression of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta in the liver tissue of chronic HBV-infected patients and the relationship between the levels of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta and HBV replication are unclear. In this study, liver biopsy specimens from 86 chronic HBV-infected patients were collected. The expression levels of HNF4alpha, HNF3beta, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) were detected by an immunohistochemical technique and the level of HBV DNA was checked by in situ hybridization with serial sections from liver biopsy tissue samples. We show here that samples with higher levels of HNF4alpha expression also have higher levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA. In contrast, in samples with higher levels of HNF3beta expression, levels of HBsAg, HBcAg and HBV DNA were lower. There was a positive correlation between HNF4alpha expression and HBV replication, and a negative correlation between HNF3beta expression and HBV replication, in the liver of chronic HBV-infected patients. This suggests that HNF4alpha and HNF3beta likely participate in HBV replication in patients with HBV infection, or that HBV replication may somehow influence the expression of HNF4alpha and HNF3beta in the liver."
8498,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"INTRODUCTION Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the consequences of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. The disease increases the risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and death and complicates antiretroviral therapy. The prevalence of CKD in HIV-1-infected patients is difficult to estimate and depends on the diagnostic criteria for CKD. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of a single measurement of serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in the diagnosis of kidney damage in patients infected with HIV-1.  PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 119 HIV-1-infected individuals (88 males [74%]), both on antiretroviral treatment and treatment-naive, with a negative history of kidney disease, and 31 healthy volunteers. We analyzed demographic characteristics as well as data on concomitant diseases, antiretroviral regimen, serum ADMA concentrations, parameters of renal function, CD4+ cell count, and HIV-1 viral load. RESULTS No significant impairment of renal function was observed. Mean serum ADMA levels in all HIV-1-infected patients, as well as in treatment-naive patients and treated patients, were significantly higher (P <0.0001; P = 0.0001; P <0.0001; respectively) compared with those in the control group. The difference between treatment-naive and treated HIV-1-infected patients was nonsignificant. ADMA levels were not correlated with the mean duration of antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral drugs used, or other risk factors for CKD. CONCLUSIONS A single measurement of ADMA levels is not useful for the diagnosis of CKD in patients without significant renal pathology or as an indicator of kidney damage related to antiretroviral therapy. The significance of repeated measurements of ADMA levels in renal function assessment requires further research."

Both viruses are extremely heterogeneous, especially for DNA viruses, and the role of the immune system in controlling the infections has yet to be established. In this study the TTV/TTMV viral loads in HIV positive tissues have been investigated for the first time. The titers of both TTV and TTMV were compared in the bone marrow and spleen tissues from three groups: HIV negative individuals, HIV positive individuals and HIV positive individuals who had progressed to AIDS, leading to immunosuppression. Limiting dilution PCR using primers situated in the UTR region of the genome were used to semi-quantitate the virus, and TTV and TTMV were differentiated using melting curve analysis of the PCR product. The AIDS group had significantly higher titers compared with both the HIV positive and negative groups for both bone marrow (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.006, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001) and spleen (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.022, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001). Analysis of TTV/TTMV titer with CD4 T lymphocyte count showed a significant inverse correlation however neither HCV co-infection or type of Anellovirus infection (single TTV or TTMV, or mixed TTV/TTMV) showed any significant correlation with virus titer. The results show a link between deterioration of the immune system and increased the viral loads in studied tissues."

Many health professionals also resist working with AIDS patients. This 1988 survey examined exaggerated risk estimates for HIV contagion in relationship to HIV-AIDS knowledge and resistance to working with AIDS patients among medical and nursing students at a large Northwestern teaching hospital. The results indicate that among the respondents, exaggerated risk estimates were associated both with a lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge and with greater resistance to working with AIDS patients. Results from multiple regression analyses revealed that (1) a lack of clinical experience with AIDS patients and (2) antihomosexual attitudes were significantly associated with the students' lack of HIV-AIDS knowledge, even after controlling for the effects of exaggerated risk estimates. The first two variables also were shown to be significantly predictive of the students' resistance to working with AIDS patients, as was an intolerance of drug use and drug users, beyond the influence of exaggerated risk estimates. Specific approaches of developing effective HIV-AIDS educational programs for health professionals are proposed."

Median CD4 count within six months of diagnosis of microsporidiosis was 33 cells/microL (range 3 to 319 cells/microL). For the national observational database (n = 24,098), the overall prevalence of microsporidiosis was 0.16%. Prevalence of microsporidiosis among HIV-infected patients with diarrheal disease is low, and microsporidiosis is most often diagnosed in patients with very low CD4+ cell counts.

QOL and medical data were collected from 1,563 of the 1,571 participants at entry into a randomized clinical trial of ART conducted in the U.S. (n = 203) and 8 resource-limited countries (n = 1,360) in the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and Africa. Participants were interviewed prior to initiation of ART using a modified version of the ACTG SF-21, a health-related QOL measure including 8 subscales: general health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, mental health, and energy/fatigue. Other measures included demographics, CD4+ lymphocyte count, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Higher quality of life in each of the 8 QOL subscales was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte category. General health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, and energy/fatigue varied by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load categories. Each QOL subscale included significant variation by country. Only the social functioning subscale varied by sex, with men having greater impairments than women, and only the physical functioning subscale varied by age category. This was the first large-scale international ART trial to conduct a standardized assessment of QOL in diverse international settings, thus demonstrating that implementation of the behavioral assessment was feasible. QOL indicators at study entry varied with disease severity, demographics, and country. The relationship of these measures to treatment outcomes can and should be examined in clinical trials of ART in resource-limited settings using similar methodologies."

We examined the association between STLEs and ARV adherence among 289 US-based participants enrolled between 7/1/2010 and 9/1/2013 in a study of depression treatment for HIV-infected patients. Participants received monthly telephone calls to assess STLEs and pill count-based ARV adherence. Inverse probability of observation weighting was combined with multiple imputation to address missing data. Participants were mostly male (71%) and black (63%), with a median age of 45 years. Median monthly adherence was 96% (interquartile range (IQR): 85-100%). Participants experienced a mean of 2.48 STLEs (range: 0-14) in the previous month. The presence of ≥2 STLEs was associated with a mean change in adherence of -3.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): -7.12%, -0.21%) and decreased likelihood of achieving ≥95% adherence (risk ratio (95% CI) = 0.82 (0.71, 0.95)). For each additional STLE, the mean adherence change was -0.90% (95% CI: -1.79%, 0.00%). STLEs were associated with poorer ARV adherence, including decreased likelihood of adhering to ≥95% of ARV doses.

However, limited data is available regarding these risks to forensic medical personnel who are exposed daily to large numbers of severely traumatized bodies in South Africa, a country that has an existing and growing HIV epidemic and a high HBV seroprevalence. Because no specific prescriptions ensuring occupational safety in this regard exist for forensic medical personnel in South Africa, the prevalence of bloodborne viruses within this setting must be determined. Blood was taken randomly from 263 bodies examined at the Medicolegal Laboratory in Pretoria. Serologic tests to detect antibodies to HIV, HCV, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I and -II) and to detect the presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) were performed and positive results confirmed using conventional serologic assays. Serologic tests detected at least one of the four bloodborne viruses in 21% of cases. The overall seroprevalence for HIV-1/2 was 11%, rising to 19% in the sexually active reproductive age group (15 - 49 years). The HBsAg prevalence overall was 8%, rising to 9% in sexually active reproductive individuals. There was a low overall HCV seroprevalence of 1% and an even lower HTLV-I/II seroprevalence of 0.01%. Forensic medical personnel in South Africa are therefore at risk of exposure to bloodborne viral pathogens in, on average, 1 of 5 bodies autopsied. This risk is compounded by the high daily workload, traumatized state of many of the bodies, and adverse working conditions. It is imperative that occupational health safety guidelines be created for the forensic medicine discipline and crime scene attendants in South Africa."

Data analysis indicated that 16S rRNA gene copy numbers for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacteria, and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella) showed marked variation in the intestine of HBV cirrhotic patients. The Bifidobacteria/Enterobacteriaceae (B/E) ratio, which may indicate microbial colonization resistance of the bowel, was decreased significantly in turn from 1.15 ± 0.11 in healthy controls, 0.99 ± 0.09 in asymptomatic carriers, and 0.76 ± 0.08 in patients with chronic hepatitis B to 0.64 ± 0.09 in patients with decompensated HBV cirrhosis (for all, P < 0.01). This suggests that B/E ratio is useful for following the level of intestinal microecological disorder in the course of liver disease progression. The data for virulence gene abundance suggested increased diversity of virulence factors during liver disease progression. Fecal secretory IgA and tumor necrosis factor-α in decompensated HBV cirrhotic patients were present at higher levels than in other groups, which indicates that a complicated autoregulatory system tries to achieve a new intestinal microecological balance."

No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."

Annual AIDS cases were increasing, and their major diseases were included with the following mycosis: pneumosystis pneumonia 35.7%, candidiasis 19.1%, and cryptococcosis 2.4%. There were two foreigner's cases of histoplasmosis and no coccidioidosis. Candidiasis was likely to be shown in Japanese patients and cryptococcosis was in foreigners. Outcome of cryptococcosis was very poor as 32.7% of patients died. There were 17 HIV-related aspergillosis, which consisted of 13 cases of lung diseases, 2 of brain lesions, and one each of sinus and stomach disease. Remarkable risk factor of HIV-related aspergillosis was decrease of CD4 cell count less than 10/microl, in addition to the usual risk factors of aspergillosis. Outcome of aspergillosis was very poor, as all treated cases died except one recent case treated with voriconazole."

For 343 where a probable transmission route could be determined, 215 were due to shared equipment by injection drug users (IDUs), 29 to homosexual intercourse, 25 to heterosexual or household contact with IDUs, 21 to heterosexual contact with infected non-IDU partners and 53 to various other or multiple routes. Cases were unevenly distributed geographically, particularly those among IDUs. The highest incidence within a post code district was approximately 2.5 times that for all Edinburgh. Annual cases peaked in 1984 then declined to low levels in the early 1990s. This reduction was most marked among IDUs, and may be ascribed both to changed injecting behaviour and decreased susceptibility within this group. The latter factor implies that HBV infections may be an unreliable guide to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in populations where HBV is highly prevalent."

This study evaluated the application of a BED enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on DBSs to estimate HIV incidence in a population-based study in India. The Calypte HIV-1 BED Incidence EIA was performed on 224 HIV-1-positive DBS samples, after screening 12 617 individuals from a population-based sample in Guntur district in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The number of recently infected HIV cases was identified using this BED assay and was used to estimate the annual HIV incidence rate based on calculations and adjustment formulae suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The updated BED data management software provided by the CDC was used for analyses. Of the 224 HIV-1 antibody-positive DBS samples, 29 (12.95 %) were estimated by the BED HIV-1 assay to have been infected within the past 155 days. After adjusting for age, gender and rural/urban distribution of the population, the annual incidence rate of HIV-1 infection was estimated to be 0.32 % (95 % confidence interval 0.20-0.44 %). This annual incidence was 18.6 % of the HIV prevalence of 1.72 % in this study. Thus, the BED assay revealed a higher incidence of HIV in this study than was expected from the prevalence. Correlation of the BED assay with panel testing and longitudinal incidence data in the Indian population is needed to calibrate it for use in India."

In this study, the aim was to evaluate the vaccination coverage and immunity against HBV among HIV-infected individuals in South Brazil, and identify factors that are associated with compliance patterns and antibody reactivity. Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "

A random sample of trauma patients treated at our rural trauma center between September 1994 and November 1995 was enrolled into a blind HIV serosurvey. Five hundred sixty-six of 1315 trauma patients (43%) were tested. Two of the 566 patients (0.35%) were HIV positive. A review of aggregate data for HIV infection among rural trauma patients in the United States show that 28 of the 4639 patients (0.60%) are HIV positive. We conclude that there was a low HIV incidence among our trauma patients from September 1994 to November 1995, and the cost-effectiveness of HIV testing for rural trauma patients is questionable with incidences between 0.5 and 1.0 per cent."

Similarly, we studied the serologic status of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients from the same district. In the donors, the incidence of serological positivity for these viruses was 0.95, 1.23, and 3.75%, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the presence of anti-HCV and serological HTLV-I positive status in these subjects (1.9 vs. 1.1%) for those with HTLV-I negative status, implying high susceptibility for HCV infection among HTLV-I carriers. Fifty-nine percent of HCC patients were positive for anti-HCV and twenty-six percent of those were simultaneously positive for the antibody to HTLV-I. HCC patients infected with HTLV-I were younger than patients not so infected (61.5 +/- 8.8 vs. 64.8 +/- 8.4 years, p < 0.05). These observations suggest the possibility that HTLV-I could be one of the factors that promote the development of HCC caused by hepatotropic viruses."

Endemic regions have been described in some Asian countries, whereas in Europe only sporadic cases have been reported. The prevalence of HEV and a series of other viral hepatitis infections was investigated in a group of 1,025 individuals immigrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union. Serum samples were tested for anti-HEV by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on recombinant proteins, and by peptide EIA and immunoblot. Risk factors and other demographic information were investigated using a questionnaire and a short interview. The overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis E antibodies (anti-HEV) was 2.05%. The following risk factors for HEV infection were identified: age of > 65 years, resident in the south-west part of the former Soviet Union, history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and employment in health care professions. HEV prevalence is not strikingly different from that observed in Western European countries. However, the different rates found for HEV vs. hepatitis A virus (HAV) are intriguing, since similar routes of transmission (fecal-oral) are well documented for both viruses. Exposure to HBV is surprisingly high, and the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive individuals was also higher than those reported from Western European areas."

A decrease in RBC deformability leads to tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to measure the rigidity of RBCs from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive individuals and investigate its relation to immune status and viral load. A filtration method based on the initial flow rate principle was used to determine the index of rigidity (IR) of 53 samples from HIV patients and 53 healthy individuals. The mean IR was significantly increased in patients with HIV compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.01). IR was inversely correlated with current CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (P < 0.0001). High CD4 cell counts (>200 cells/microl) are related to low IR values, independently of the viral load (VL). No differences in rigidity were noted between the VL groups, although there was a trend towards an increased IR in patients with high VL within the group of CD4<200. RBC deformability is decreased in HIV disease, in a degree mainly related to CD4 depletion. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the role of VL in highly immunocompromised HIV patients."

HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."

In a retrospective study a representative sample (n = 3,143) of the pregnant women registered in the health public service in the province of Córdoba was evaluated. HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence was 0.191% +/- 0.0857 [IC 0.022-0.359]. This prevalence was 10 times higher in pregnant women than in blood donors [0.019 (4/21.183)]. The pregnant women would reflect the epidemiology of the general population more accurately since it constitutes a more heterogeneous group than that of blood donors. The prevalence of infection with HIV was 2.8 times higher than that of HTLV-1/2 (P < 0.05) and the presence of any of these two viruses was not a subrogating indicator of the presence of the other (Goodman and Kruskal's Tau coefficient = 0.0092). The prevalence of HBV was not significantly different from that of HTLV-1/2 (P > 0.05). We consider that it is necessary to carry out continuous studies in order to define the main risk factors for infection of these women. Thus, a decision could be made to apply the best policy in public health to prevent vertical transmission of the virus in Argentina."

However, the prevalence of hepatitis viral infection and its genotype distribution among hemodialysis patients in Indonesia are unclear. In order to investigate these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission, 161 hemodialysis patients and 35 staff members at one of the hemodialysis unit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, were tested for serological and virological markers of both viruses. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 18 patients (11.2%) and in two staff members (5.7%). Anti-HCV was detected in 130 patients (80.7%) but not in any staff members. Occult HBV and HCV infection were detected in 21 (14.7%) and 4 (12.9%) patients, respectively. The overall prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infection among patients were 24.2% and 83.2%, respectively. HCV infection was independently associated with hemodialysis duration and the number of blood transfusions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 23 of 39 tested HBV strains (59%) were genotype B, 11 (28.2%) were genotype C, and 5 (12.8%) were genotype A. HCV genotype 1a was dominant (95%) among 100 tested HCV strains. Nosocomial transmission was suspected because the genotype distribution differed from that of the general population in Indonesia, and because the viral genomes of several strains were identical. These findings suggest that HBV and HCV infection is common among hemodialysis patients in Yogyakarta, and probably occurs through nosocomial infection. Implementation of strict infection-control programs is necessary in hemodialysis units in Indonesia."

In 1984 a cohort of 301 hospital employees was tested for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (anti HBc), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Ten years later, 160 (53%) of these workers remained at the hospital and were re-tested. In addition, they were tested for hepatitis C virus antibody (anti HCV). Records of the hospital vaccination program were inspected to determine the rate and effectiveness of vaccination in these workers. Over the ten year period two of the 160 retested workers (1.25%) had sero-converted to anti HBc positive, yielding an incidence density of 0.27 cases per 100 person-years exposed in unvaccinated workers. While the overall seroprevalence of anti HBc did not change significantly between 1984 (81/301, 27%) and 1994 (39/160, 24%), it was much greater than that of the general population (10%). A significantly greater percentage of Jews of Sephardi ancestry (22/65, 34%) were positive for anti HBc than those of Ashkenazi ancestry (15/90, 17%, P < 0.05). In addition, doctors were found to be less likely to be anti HBc positive than nurses (4% vs. 25%, respectively, P < 0.01). Two cases of anti HCV positivity were discovered yielding a prevalence of 1.25% in the 1994 cohort as compared to 0.15% in the population of healthy blood donors. Of the 93 employees of the 1994 cohort eligible for vaccination (i.e., anti HBc-negative and employed in an occupation involving potential exposure to HBV), 53 (57%) had received vaccination and showed protective antibody titers (anti HBs > or = 10 i.u./ml). 17/52 workers with documented vaccinations (33%) did not have detectable antibody levels one to eight years after vaccination. In conclusion, the seroprevalence of anti HBc and anti HCV is significantly higher in this cohort of hospital employees than in the general population. The relatively low vaccination rate among at-risk personnel emphasizes the need for more effective vaccination programs."

In this hospital, 100 SMDs are hospitalized. Case 1: The disabled, 25 year old male, was transmitted Hepatitis A from a nurse. Case 2: The disabled, 60 year old female carrier of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) who has been cared for more than 10 years. Case 3: The disabled, 46 year old male carrier of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (RNA type 3), has been cared for more than 4 years. Case 4: The disabled, 39 year old male, had a fever of 39 degrees C for 9 days and suddenly died. He was diagnosed as fulminant hepatitis due to HSV-1 by necropsy. The hospitals for SMD are characteristic in prevention of nosocomial infections; 1) The disabled infected is not aware of the fact that he or she is the source of infection and that the other disabled living with him or her are in risk of infection, because of their severe mental condition. 2) All of the disabled need complete or incomplete helps for activities of daily life (ADL), so that the disabled who is the carrier of some pathogen constantly gives risk of infection to staffs, including medical staffs (doctor, nurse and therapist), psychologist and helpers by bloody secretion from wounds, saliva, urine, feces as well as menstrual blood. 3) If a carrier of some pathogen is hospitalized, the staffs should serve under risk of infection involving blood-mediated infectious disease for many years, because SMDs are permitted lifelong stay in the hospitals for SMD, which also play a role of care house or institution, by public expense in Japan. In case of an outbreak of Hepatitis A, nosocomial infection ended in the original case (a nurse), another nurse and a case of the disabled by general treatment and care against communicable diseases of the digestive organs. In care of HBV and HCV carriers, an ordinary program to prevent nosocomial infection has been practiced in our hospital more strictly than in conventional hospital. HBV vaccine is injected to staffs caring the HB carriers who are negative on HBs antibody. Thus, during more than 10 years of care of HBV carrier and more than 4 years of care of HCV carrier, nosocomial infection has never been experienced clinically as well as serologically in our hospital. However, we have often been faced by difficulty to guarantee QOL (quality of life) of the carriers, because carrier states of HBV or HCV have been long-lasting and they have been occasionally and inevitably separated physically and/or psychologically in order to prevent nosocomial infection. In case 4, it was suspected that previously latently infected HSV-1 would be activated by another viral infection which had elicited fever for 9 days before death. The patient had neither history nor sign or symptom of immunodeficiency and had never been given drugs known as to be immunosuppressive as side effect."

However, parenteral self-administration, and the advanced disease and antiretroviral experience of patients currently most needing enfuvirtide introduce unique usage considerations. Enfuvirtide has been shown to provide clinically relevant improvements in CD4 cell counts and reductions in HIV viraemia across all subgroups of treatment-experienced patients studied, including those taking few or no other active drugs. However, optimal outcome results from initiation when the CD4 cell count is above 100 x 10(6) cells/l and viraemia below 1 x 10(5) copies/ml, as part of a newly constructed third or fourth antiretroviral regimen in combination with one or two other antiretrovirals to which the virus remains sensitive. Resistance testing should be used where available to guide background drug selection. Where insufficient options for an effective background exist, enfuvirtide should still be considered and treatment undertaken with the aim of achieving an immunological or clinical response, despite the unlikelihood of a sustained virological outcome. Similarly, where there is no viable alternative treatment, enfuvirtide should be continued following virological failure wherever ongoing immunological or clinical benefit is discerned. Injection site reactions (ISRs) are common on enfuvirtide and will affect almost all patients. ISRs are manageable and seldom activity- or treatment-limiting. Bacterial pneumonia and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported uncommonly. A structured series of patient visits with a healthcare professional provides an atmosphere of ongoing training and support that may prevent 'injection fatigue', maintain adherence and minimise the incidence of ISRs. An initial investment in establishing such procedures can be expected to yield significant returns in patient confidence and benefit on enfuvirtide."

HIV-1 Tat protein is thought to contribute to HAD by transactivating host genes, such as that encoding monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), although its mechanisms of action are not fully understood. We investigated the molecular pathways involved in Tat-induced MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression in human astrocytes. We found that Tat induced MCP-1/CCL2 synthesis in human astrocytes infected with a lentivirus carrying the gene encoding Tat or treated with a biologically active synthetic Tat protein. The induction of MCP-1/CCL2 was independent of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) classical pathway, but was significantly inhibited by specific cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) inhibitors, such as a dominant-negative mutant or siRNA. By contrast, broader-spectrum cdk inhibitors, such as roscovitine, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), and flavopiridol, inhibited MCP-1/CCL2 induction by Tat. We also analyzed the effects of roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol on Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) expression following the infection of astrocytes and HeLa cells. Astrocytes showed no inhibition by roscovitine, 59% inhibition by DRB, and 80% inhibition by flavopiridol. In control HeLa cells, high levels of inhibition were observed with roscovitine, DRB, and flavopiridol. We have ascertained the direct implication of cdk9 in Tat-induced MCP-1 expression by performing ChIP assay. These results demonstrate that cdk9 is involved in Tat-induced HIV-1 LTR, MCP-1/CCL2 gene expression."

Liver diseases are one of the three primary causes of 'non-AIDS-related' death in people living with HIV for three reasons: the high prevalence of hepatotropic viral co-infections, the hepatotoxicity of ARV drugs and new emerging liver diseases, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia and hepatitis E virus infection. The impact of HIV infection on the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV co-infection has markedly changed in the past few decades with the progress made in ARV treatment and the improved definition of therapeutic strategies for HCV or HBV. Initially, HIV had a negative impact on hepatotropic infections. Today, HIV does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of HCV and HBV infection. This is associated with fair immune restoration, viral suppression associated with analogues having dual activity against HBV and HIV and with the increasing efficacy of antiviral treatments against HCV. A significant decline is expected in the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic liver infection in co-infected patients. Nevertheless, today, there are three major issues: (i) improving preventive measures including vaccination and risk reduction; (ii) screening patients infected with HBV or HCV and evaluating the impact of chronic infection on the liver and finally; (iii) early screening of hepatocellular carcinoma whose occurrence is higher and that evolves more rapidly in co-infected than in mono-infected patients."

Such an association, however, seems to be limited to geographic areas where the presence of HCV is more relevant or endemic. According to a multistep pathogenetic model based on a large series of clinical, immunological, histological, and molecular evidences, an HCV antigen-driven polyclonal B-cell lymphoproliferation could be the initial phase of a process leading, in a variable time, into a true clonal disease. Particular genetic and environmental backgrounds could play a role in the development of a malignant phenotype, while specific HCV genotypes do not seem to be relevant in this setting. Hepatitis C virus correlated with NHL often shows some distinctive clinicopathological features, such as older age, liver damage, presence of monoclonal gammopathy (often with no clinically relevant cryoglobulinemic and/or rheumatoid activity), increased rate of autoimmune disorders, extranodal localizations, and restricted histological subtypes. Overall, the clinical outcome of HCV-positive NHL does not seem to be different from that of NHL patients without HCV infection. However, the evidence of a significant hepatic injury may predict a worse prognosis in these subjects."

We reviewed hospitalizations for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in 2011 and 2012. Individual- and system-level variables were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for ART initiation prior to discharge. With Georgia Department of Health surveillance data, we estimated time to first clinic visit, ART initiation, and viral suppression. In the study population (n = 81), ART was initiated prior to discharge in 10 (12%) patients. Shorter hospital stay was significantly associated with lack of ART initiation at the time of HIV diagnosis (8 versus 24 days, OR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.25). Reducing barriers to ART initiation for newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients with short hospital stays may improve time to viral suppression."

The results show that, despite the progress attained in the management of HIV infection since the introduction of HAART, clinicians facing newly diagnosed cases of AIDS will likely encounter a spectrum of opportunistic diseases and a level of underlying immunodeficiency similar to those observed during the decade preceding the introduction of HAART. Even in recent years, the large majority of patients newly diagnosed with AIDS have not been able to take advantage of HAART prior to diagnosis of their disease."

As a result, organ related manifestations of late stage HIV infection, including HIV-related heart diseases have emerged. It is now clear that cardiac involvement in HIV seropositive patients is relatively common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HIV infection is multifactorial. The epidemiology has changed dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but studies carried out before the introduction of HAART remain relevant because of limited access to this treatment in many areas of the world. A variety of cardiac lesions have been reported in HIV infection and AIDS, including pericardial disease with effusion and tamponade, nonspecific or infectious myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with global left ventricular dysfunction, endocardial valvular disease due to marantic or infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and neoplastic invasion. In the post HAART-era, coronary artery disease and dyslipidaemia, drug related cardiotoxicity and cardiac autonomic dysfunction are becoming increasingly prevalent. In this review, we highlight the importance of cardiac complications in HIV disease and discuss measures that can be taken to improve survival."

Both patients had no history of alcohol abuse, nor intravenous drug use and were tested negative for HCV (PCR RNA) and had no HBS antigen. Patient 1 had a past history of hypertrygliceridemia, but controlled with dietetic measures for 4 years prior to biopsy. The first hepatic biopsy showed a disseminated macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The patient had then cytolysis and an uncontrolled HIV viral load. The second biopsy was performed two years later, and HIV was controlled by a new line of ART. It showed a regression of the steatosis (10%) and a progression of the fibrosis with signs of cirrhosis. Patient 2 had a long history of HIV infection. He also had an uncontrolled dyslipidemia. The first biopsy was realised during a period of uncontrolled HIV infection and elevated liver enzymes. The biopsy showed a major macrovacuolar steatosis (>80%). The second biopsy was realised 6 years after and showed the same steatosis and signs of cirrhosis. The HIV infection was then under control. Observations reported here show a rapid evolution of liver steatosis to cirrhosis in HIV positive / HCV negative patients, despite the control of HIV infection. The implication of HAART remains unclear. In the era of HAART, liver steatosis can rapidly evoluate to cirrhosis without any risk factor except ART."

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of oral lesions in a cohort of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART, to compare these data with the prevalence of lesions prior to HAART and to correlate these finding with the immunologic data. A total of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART were selected. Oral lesions associated with HIV infection and immunological parameters were registered. On re-examination 6 months after the first evaluation, 61/103 patients were available. Comparing the prevalence of oral lesions before and after the onset of HAART, the number of oral lesions was significantly lower (P=0.001). The number of CD4+ cells increased and the viral load decreased significantly after initiation of HAART (P=0.001 and P= 0.0001). On re-examination 6 months later, the prevalence of lesions again decreased significantly (P=0.001). The immunological benefits of HAART may prevent HIV-associated oral lesions in patients with advanced HIV disease. Our results showed that oral manifestations decrease on HAART, but in four patients the immunological effects of therapy did not provide sufficient protection against human papillomavirus (HPV)induced lesions."

HIV infected patients are living longer owing to advances in antiretroviral therapy and treatment of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections but because of their immunodeficiency they are at high risk of cancers, especially NHL. The natural history of cancers in patients with HIV infection differs from that of the general population. Unusual aspects of tumor localization, growth behaviour and therapeutical response, distinguish tumors in patients with from those without HIV infection. The pathologic and virological aspects of HIV-related tumors are peculiar and a pathological classification of HIV associated systemic lymphomas based on the morphological features of the two main types, i.e. blastic and anaplastic cell lymphomas has been formulated. The treatment of HIV-related neoplasms is controversial as it is not clear whether conventional therapy and in particular chemotherapy is able to modify the natural history of these malignancies in HIV setting. Moreover the treatment of HIV-related tumors presents several problems, due to the aggressive behaviours of tumors and because of immunosuppressive chemotherapy employed in patients with immunodeficiency."

Adherent cells that had spindle morphology and several characteristics of spindle cells of KS lesions (KS cells) were identified in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction only after culture in the presence of conditioned medium (CM) from activated lymphocytes. The peripheral blood-derived spindle cells (PBsc) expressed a variety of endothelial cell markers, such as Ulex europaeus I lectin, EN4, EN2/3, EN7/44, CD13, CD34, CD36, CD54, ELAM-1, and HLA-DR. However, they were negative for CD2, CD19, PaIE, and factor VIII-related antigen. The PBsc produced angiogenic factors as evidenced by the ability of CM from these cells to promote growth of normal vascular endothelial cells. In addition, subcutaneously injected PBsc stimulated angiogenesis in vivo in athymic nude mice. We determined that the number of PBsc grown from the peripheral blood of HIV-1+ patients with KS or at high risk to develop KS were increased by 78-fold (P = .0001) and 18-fold (P = .005), respectively, when compared with HIV-1- controls. The number of spindle cells cultured from the HIV-1+ patients at low risk for developing KS, eg, HIV-1+ injection drug users, showed no statistical increase when compared with HIV-1- controls. The presence of increased PBsc with characteristics of KS cells in HIV-1+ KS patients or patients at high risk for developing KS gives insights into the origin of KS cells and may explain the multifocal nature of the disease. In addition, this may be useful in predicting the risk of KS development."

In this study we tried to determine whether also NK cells are affected by relevant activation and whether this could be associated with decreased NK cell function. In 18 viremic HIV-1-infected patients, freshly drawn purified peripheral NK cells displayed significant levels of activation with an incomplete pattern (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)CD25(-)NKp44(-)). Activated (HLA-DR(+)CD69(+)) peripheral NK cells expressed an NCR(dull) phenotype as determined by cytofluorometric analysis in all the patients, and did not derive from a homogeneous/oligoclonal expansion in vivo as analyzed by expression of HLA-specific inhibitory NK cell receptors. As determined by cytotoxicity assays, activated NK cells showed a decreased cytolytic function in HIV-1-infected patients. Thus, the decrease in NK cell function observed during HIV-1 infection is associated not only with decreased NCR expression, but also with significant and incomplete NK cell activation in vivo. These results suggest a consistent continuous involvement of the innate immune response in the failure to control viral replication."
8525,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"A triterpene derived from betulinic acid (RPR103611) blocks human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and fusion of CD4+ cells with cells expressing HIV-1 envelope proteins (gp120 and gp41), suggesting an effect on virus entry. This compound did not block infection by a subtype D HIV-1 strain (NDK) or cell-cell fusion mediated by the NDK envelope proteins. The genetic basis of drug resistance was therefore addressed by testing envelope chimeras derived from NDK and a drug-sensitive HIV-1 strain (LAI, subtype B). A drug-resistant phenotype was observed for all chimeras bearing the ectodomain of NDK gp41, while the origins of gp120 and of the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic domains of gp41 had no apparent role. The envelope gene of a LAI variant, fully resistant to the antiviral effect of RPR103611, was cloned and sequenced. Its product differed from the parental sequence at two positions in gp41, with changes of arginine 22 to alanine (R22A) and isoleucine 84 to serine (I84S), the gp120 being identical. In the context of LAI gp41, the I84S substitution was sufficient for drug resistance. Therefore, in two different systems, differences in gp41 were associated with sensitivity or resistance to RPR103611. Modifications of gp41 can affect the quaternary structure of gp120 and gp41 and the accessibility of gp120 to antiviral agents such as neutralizing antibodies. However, a direct effect of RPR103611 on a gp41 target must also be envisioned, in agreement with the blocking of apparently late steps of HIV-1 entry. This compound could be a valuable tool for structure-function studies of gp41."

Data were obtained from databases systematically maintained by Family Advocacy, Care and Education Services (FACES) and the HIV Outpatient Program (HOP) in New Orleans. HIV-infected women receiving primary care from HOP and ancillary services from FACES between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1998 were eligible. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with STATA software. The majority of women included in the study were African American (86.7%), infected heterosexually (78.8%), and had absolute CD4 counts greater than 200 (58.6%). After adjusting for age, time, entry time into HOP, pregnancy, CD4 count, substance abuse status, and social and clinical stressors, receipt of more than four combined case manager contacts or ancillary services per month was significantly associated with being prescribed a protease inhibitor, improved adherence and retention in primary care, and enrolling on a research protocol. Receiving more than one transportation service per month was significantly associated with improved adherence, improved retention, one or more emergency room visits per month, and one or more hospitalizations per month. Receiving more than one contact with case managers per month was associated with improved retention in primary care. Findings suggest that receipt of case management and ancillary services is associated with improvements in multiple outcomes for HIV-infected women. A client-centered approach to providing ancillary services appears to be effective in improving behavioral and utilization characteristics in this population of low-income, high-risk women."

A total of 125 viral sequences obtained from patients believed to have acquired their HIV-1 infection in Africa were analyzed, of which 121 were determined to belong to non-B subtypes. Utilizing Tru Gene sequence data alone, 92 (76%) of these viruses could be subtyped by conventional phylogenetic analysis. The addition of supplemental RT sequence data enabled a further 28 (23.1%) viruses to be classified, while one (0.9%) sample could not be classified conclusively. Two internet-accessible databases that generate HIV-1 subtypes from PR and RT sequences (HIV-SEQ and Geno 2 Pheno) were also evaluated, and both achieved 88% concordance (106/120) with phylogenetic analysis. Non-subtype-B and B-subtype HIV-1 sequences could be readily discriminated by tallying silent polymorphisms listed on the Tru Gene research report. The mean number of silent polymorphisms in the non-B HIV-1 sequences identified in this study was 58.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.1 to 75.5), compared with 20.7 (95% CI, 9.9 to 31.5) for the four subtype B viruses in the study cohort and 118 case-matched B-subtype controls. Sequence data generated in the Tru Gene HIV-1 genotyping assay could, therefore, provide a ready means of tracking the prevalence and identity of non-B subtypes in HIV-1-infected populations undergoing routine antiretroviral resistance testing."

In Korea, zidovudine has been widely administered, without charge, through the National AIDS program since the early 1990s; with other potent antiretroviral agents also being introduced in the late 1990s. An analysis of the drug susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs was performed by genotyping of the drug-resistant mutations in HIV on plasma samples from 50 HIV-infected patients who had received no treatment, between February 1998 and November 2002, which was interpreted according to the consensus guidelines of the International AIDS Society-USA panel. The median CD4 cell count was 100 cells/mm3; the mean plasma RNA level was (5.19 +/- 0.56) log copies per milliliter. Of the 50 subjects tested 4 (8.0%) had one or more major drug-resistance mutation. The prevalence of resistance to multiple classes of drugs was 2.0%. No mutations, associated with resistance to non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, were identified. Resistant mutations of the reverse-transcriptase gene were found at codons 67, 70, 118, 215, and 219, and a resistant mutation of the protease gene was found only at codon 46 (2.6%, 1 of 39). There was an 8.0% prevalence of primary drug resistance to antiretroviral drugs in Korean patients infected with HIV-1."

Antiretroviral drugs (ARVD) were not available to these patients. The records of 49 patients, 17 males and 32 females, aged between 17 and 67 years, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a nine-year period, were reviewed. Forty-eight of these underwent cardiac surgery and one aortic dissection repair. Four HIV-infected patients underwent surgery with good early outcome. Thereafter an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 400/microl (normal 550*1 955/microl) and the absence of the stigmata of AIDS in patients fulfilling the normal criteria for surgery allowed cardiac surgery using CPB. Fifty operations were performed. Three patients with CD4 counts of 37, 868 and 1 245/microl died early, giving a 30-day mortality of 6% for 50 procedures. Six patients with active infective endocarditis (IE) underwent emergency surgery. Three of these, one with a pre- and two with only post-operative counts all below 250/microl, died within three months. Sixteen complications occurred in the remaining 46 patients (34.7%). Pre-operative CD4 cell counts taken in 42 patients averaged 685/microl. Pre- and post-operative counts known in eight showed variations, as did repeated counts in those awaiting surgery. Forty-one patients left hospital in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, five in class II and one in class III. Prior to surgery, the majority (38) were in class III and seven were in class IV. Follow up ranging from two to 70 months averaged 23.1 months. Eight late deaths occurred, three related to AIDS. We found surgery to be worthwhile in selected HIV-infected patients. Early outcome paralleled that in the uninfected, giving a low risk-to-benefit ratio. Emergency surgery in those with active infective endocarditis and marked immune compromise met with high mortality. It is essential in our population to test and stage all patients for HIV. We could not show that CPB accelerated progression to AIDS. This experience and the present availability of ARVDs would enable us to review our selection criteria for surgery."

All newly diagnosed patients for HIV-infection from 2004 to 2013 at a reference medical care area in Northwest of Spain were identified. Epidemiological, virological, immunological, and clinical data, as well as HIV genotype and drug resistance information were recorded. A total of 565 newly HIV-diagnosed patients were identified. The number of new cases increased in the last 5 years (66 cases/year). Overall, 53.1% had a median CD4 counts < 350 cells/µl and 33.6% had an AIDS defining criteria. Non-B variants were found in 34.4% of patients being subtype F (25.8%) the most common non-B subtype. The rate of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) over the study period was 3.7%, but a decreased to 2.6% was observed in the last 5 years. The most prevalent TDR mutations were: T215 revertants (1.5%), K219QENR (1.2%), for NRTIs; K103N (1.9%), for NNRTIs; L90M (0.3%), for PIs. Overall, 73.2% of patients started antiretroviral treatment and 9.9% of patients died during follow-up. The number of newly HIV diagnosed patients increased since year 2009. There is a high prevalence of late diagnosis (53%) and 33% had an AIDS defining criteria. Interestingly, the most prevalent non-B subtype in our population was F (25.8%). These findings support the need to facilitate the access for HIV testing to reduce the rate of late HIV diagnosis, improve the clinical outcome and prevent HIV transmission."
2595,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Abstract The diagnosis of HIV-1 is increasing in African-born persons residing in Europe. They present a high prevalence of HIV-1 non-B variant infections and of parasitic infections, both of which are infrequent in Western countries. Immigration favors their presence in nonendemic countries. In this study, all newly HIV-diagnosed individuals at an HIV/AIDS and Tropical Medicine reference center in Madrid from 2005 through 2007 were retrospectively studied. HIV-1 subtyping was performed in gag, pol, and gp41 coding regions by phylogenetic analyses. The presence of other pathogens was also evaluated. Furthermore, all HIV-1-infected Africans were screened for parasitic infections. Newly diagnosed HIV-1 subjects included 90 sub-Saharan Africans and 188 non-Africans (116 Spaniards, 13 other Europeans, and 59 Latin Americans). Significantly higher numbers of HIV-1-infected Africans than non-Africans were females, acquired HIV-1 by heterosexual contact, and presented a more advanced clinical CDC stage and criteria for starting antiretroviral therapy in the first clinical visit. They predominantly carried non-B subtype infections, mainly intersubtype recombinants. Half of HIV-1-infected Africans had parasitic infections. CD4(+) T cell counts were lower among Africans than Europeans at the time of HIV-1 diagnosis. At 12 months of follow-up after starting antiretroviral treatment, a significantly lower proportion of Africans than non-Africans achieved undetectable viremia due to their higher loss to follow-up. However, CD4(+) T cell recovery and virological failure rates were similar. Therefore, the profile of African HIV-1-infected immigrants varies widely with respect to Spanish HIV-infected individuals. More advanced immunodeficiency and the coexistence of parasitic diseases and infections with a large diversity of HIV-1 non-B and recombinant variants are expected."
6437,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Immigration from developing regions to Western countries has resulted in an increased rate of non-B subtypes in the HIV population. However, it is unclear whether these HIV variants remain confined to foreigners or are already spreading among natives. Since many immigrants come from regions in which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are endemic, HIV-hepatitis coinfection might be more frequent in newly diagnosed HIV persons. Herein, we report changes in the prevalence and distribution of HIV-1 subtypes in Madrid, Spain over the past 10 years as well as the rate of chronic HBV and HCV coinfection in 1854 newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals. Overall 18.2% carried HIV-1 non-B subtypes, although the prevalence increased over time reaching a peak of 19.4% in the last period (2007-2010). The most common non-B variants were CRF02_AG (37%), G (12%), A (9.9%), and C (7.8%). In native Spaniards the rate of non-B subtypes increased from 1.5% in 2000-2002 to 7.2% in 2003-2006 and to 11.4% in 2007-2010 (p = 0.04). Chronic hepatitis B and C were found, respectively, in 4.2% and 8.3% of the study population. While the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B has remained fairly stable over time across distinct populations, the rate of chronic HCV infection has experienced a significant decline, mainly in native Spaniards as a result of a reduction in intravenous drug use. In summary, the prevalence of HIV-1 non-B subtypes is rising in newly diagnosed HIV-1 individuals in Spain, including the native population. In contrast, the rate of HBV coinfection remains unchanged and the rate of HCV coinfection has declined."

The objective of the study was to provide detailed biochemical information about metabolic syndrome in this condition. One hundred forty-six HIV-infected male and female patients on ART for more than 6 months were compared with 156 body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy subjects. Lipodystrophy was diagnosed upon patient and physician concordance. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Plasma adiponectin (AD) and leptin were measured by radioimmunoassay. Insulin resistance (IR) was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was higher in HIV-infected patients on ART than in non-HIV-infected healthy controls (15.8% vs 3.2%; P < .001). Patients with metabolic syndrome are older (44.6 +/- 6 vs 39.8 +/- 8 years; P = .004), have an increased BMI (24.9 +/- 3.8 vs 22.9 +/- 9.8 kg/m(2); P = .01), present with a reduced AD-to-leptin ratio log(10) (-0.19 +/- 0.4 vs 0.5 +/- 0.4; P = .04), and show increased IR (HOMA, 5.6 +/- 2.7 vs 3.8 +/- 2.2; P = .001; plasma fasting insulin, 22.9 +/- 9.8 vs 16.6 +/- 9.7 ng/mL; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the diagnosis of lipo and HOMA were independently and significantly related to metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is significantly increased in HIV-infected patients on ART and its presence is associated with lipo, increased age and BMI, IR, and a reduced plasma AD-to-leptin ratio."

The prevalence of the HBV surface antigen or antibody to it was significantly higher in patients than in controls and increased with the number of blood transfusions. In contrast, the prevalence of antibody to HAV was significantly lower in patients than in controls and decreased with the number of blood transfusions. These results support the view that blood transfusion does not play any appreciable part in transmitting HAV. Indeed, regular blood transfusion, where donors almost all have HAV antibody, seems to give protection against infection."

We examined whether depression or anxiety was associated with delayed initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among a prospective cohort of Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) who were newly diagnosed with HIV. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used for measuring depression and anxiety, with scores of 0-7, 8-10, and 11-21 representing normal, borderline, and likely, respectively. ART initiation information was extracted from the National ART Database. Cox regression was performed to assess associations between HADS scores and the time to ART initiation. Of 364 eligible participants enrolling in the cohort within a median of 11 days after HIV diagnosis, 62% initiated ART during the 12-month follow-up period. The baseline prevalence for likely/borderline depression was 36%, and likely/borderline anxiety was 42%. In adjusted analyses, compared with a depression score of 0, the likelihood of starting ART was 1.82 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38-2.41], 3.11 (95% CI: 1.82-5.30), and 2.53 (95% CI: 1.48-4.32) times higher for depression scores of 3, 9, and 13, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for the anxiety score. In contrast to our hypothesis, both depression and anxiety were associated with earlier ART initiation among Chinese MSM with newly diagnosed HIV. We speculate that individuals who are more concerned about their new HIV diagnosis may be more likely to seek HIV care and follow a doctor's advice. The effects of depression or anxiety on ART initiation likely differ in varying subgroups and by symptom severity."

It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."

We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

We conducted a cohort study of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus in Mozambique. Only persons treated with HAART with available CD4 cell counts at baseline and ≥ 1 CD4 cell count after HAART were included. Survival analysis was applied to evaluate the prognostic value of CD4 cell counts measured at three months. Possible confounders were considered. A total of 753 persons who started HAART included; 59% were females. Median age was 34 years (range = 16-67 years), and the median CD4 cell count at baseline was 172 cells/mm3 (interquartile range = 87-261 cells/mm3, range = 0-1,322 cells/mm3). Overall, 105 persons (14%) died. Of these persons 54 (51%) developed AIDS before they died; 25 (3%) died during the first three months. After three months of therapy, the individual median CD4 cell count change from the baseline value was +101 cells/mm3 (interquartile range = +27 to +187 cells/mm3, range = -723 to +310 cells/mm3). A median CD4 increment of 100 cells/mm3 in three months was associated with a mortality reduction of 50% compared with an increase of < 50 cells (relative hazard of death adjusted for baseline CD4 cell count = 0.54, 95% confidence interval = 0.30-0.95). A good initial response to HAART was associated with a significant reduction of mortality. This finding supports the effectiveness of HAART in resource-poor settings."

DNA sequencing was applied to amplicons obtained directly from serum and those cloned into plasmid vectors, and from single HBV molecules in serum separated by a limiting dilution procedure. In one surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 3 x 10(5) genome equivalents ml-1, the direct sequence was identical to none of 29 other sequences and differed by one base substitution from the sequence amplified from the single patient he infected. In another surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 2 x 10(6) genome equivalents ml-1, the direct sequence was identical to 17 of 36 (47%) sequences; however, the sequence common to all three infected patients was identical to a unique sequence in the surgeon that differed by three base substitutions from the direct sequence. By contrast, the direct sequence in the third surgeon, who had a titre of approximately 4 x 10(7) genome equivalents ml-1, was identical to 25 of 38 (66%) sequences, and to the sequence common to all 11 infected patients. Assessment of HBV DNA sequences directly amplified from clinical specimens may not be appropriate to studies of transmission in which the source of infection harbours a relatively dilute, heterogeneous mix of viral variants."

Results revealed a high prevalence of potential pathogens. The most prevalent viral infection found was HBV (59.4% prevalence) of which 89.4% of infected individuals seroconverted to the non-infectious state and 10.6% remained as chronic carriers. Antibodies to HAV, HSV, HTLV-1, and SRV were also detected but at a lower prevalence. There was no evidence of lentiviral infections in this group of animals. The results confirm the importance of quarantine and the need for diagnostic differentiation of virus infections to determine if they are of human origin or unique orangutan viruses."

Therefore, polyclonality of the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response has been hypothesized to be a major determinant in the control of infection. We analyzed the Vbeta chain composition of the core 18-27-specific CD8 cells in acute and persistently HBV-infected patients using HLA-A2 tetrameric complexes and a panel of Vbeta antibodies. Different T cell receptors were utilized by core 18-27-specific CD8 cells both in patients with acute and chronic infection. The functional ability of these epitope-specific T cells to respond to potential viral mutations was then tested. The polyclonal HBV-specific CD8 response present in patients with acute hepatitis displayed a limited efficiency to recognize mutations introduced within the epitope. The ability of core 18-27-specific CD8 to tolerate epitope mutations was found only during persistent HBV infection. The data suggest that although a clonally heterogeneous CD8 response can be largely inhibited by the occurrence of single epitope mutations in primary HBV infection, preferential selection of T cells able to counteract the emergence of viral mutations can occur during persistent infection."

Precise regulation of the ratio between these forms is unknown, but its fluctuation may have a clinical impact. An enrichment method was applied to assess the SVP/VP ratio in chronically infected patients (CHB) and to compare the sensitivity of HBs antigen (HBsAg) and DNA detection methods. Plasmas from 9 genotype A-D CHB patients were fractionated on Nycodenz(®) gradients, and both HBV DNA and HBsAg were quantified in each collected fraction using standardized techniques expressed in IU/mL. Infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) was performed with crude or fractionated plasma. Independently of the genotype, all plasmas showed a similar rate-zonal separation profile characterized by a bottom DNA-enriched peak surmounted by HBsAg-enriched fractions. Inoculation of PHH with plasma-derived VP-enriched fractions led to long-lasting production of virus in cell supernatants with a SVP/VP ratio similar to that observed in patient plasmas. In the VP fraction, one IU of HBsAg corresponded to approximately 5 million IU of HBV DNA. Rate-zonal gradient separation directly applied on patient plasma allows a better insight into the distribution of VP in HBeAg-positive CHB carriers. This study highlights the sensitivity difference of the techniques classically used to monitor HBV infection and indicates that VP-associated HBsAg contributes modestly to the overall amount of total circulating HBsAg in CHB. Such a fractionation approach should help to understand the fine regulation of HBsAg production over replication at different stages of CHB. "

Serum from a chronically infected patient who was the source of the virus was inoculated into three chimpanzees at dilutions of 10(-1), 10(-3), and 10(-7). All three chimpanzees developed acute hepatitis B with relatively high peak values of liver enzymes in their serum. The complete nucleotide sequence of virus DNA recovered from the chimpanzee serum by enzymatic amplification was identical with that from the human serum. By comparing the sequence of this strain (HT) with that of 32 published HBV genomes, changes in nucleotides and predicted amino acids that were rarely or never found in other HBV isolates were identified. Thirteen such nucleotides were found within the cis-acting regulatory elements, of which 6 were within the enhancer II-core promoter region. Twenty-four rare or unique changes in amino acids were found in open reading frames, of which 15 occurred in the region that spanned the 3' half of the X gene, through the pre-core/core gene, to the 5' end of the polymerase gene. Thus, an HBV pre-core stop mutant implicated in fulminant hepatitis is highly infectious, induces severe hepatitis in chimpanzees, and possesses significant genetic variation from reported HBV isolates."

These two vectors, vCP205 encoding HIV-1 gp120 + TM (28 amino acid transmembrane anchor sequence) in addition to Gag/protease and vCP300 encoding gp120 + Gag/protease as well as Nef and Pol CTL determinants, are pancytotropic but replication incompetent in mammalian cells. Bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or enriched CD8+ T cells were stimulated for 10 days with autologous ALVAC-infected PBMCs in the presence of different cytokine combinations (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-7, and IL-12). Activation by ALVAC constructs was highly antigen-specific, because vCP205 elicited only Env and Gag CTL, whereas vCP300 elicited broader reactivities against Env, Gag, Pol, and Nef determinants. The ALVAC activation of CTLp was IL-2 dependent and enhanced by the addition of IL-7, whereas IL-4 and IL-12 failed to augment cytotoxic reactivities elicited by these constructs. The expansion of enriched CD8+ T cells after activation with vCP300 was higher in patients with CD4 counts greater than 400 cells/microL. Two rounds of in vitro stimulation (IVS) with vCP300 resulted in nearly an eightfold expansion of CD8+ lymphocytes over a 25-day period. After the second IVS, an average 3.2-fold increase among the different antigen-specific CTL frequencies was achieved. These studies clearly show that HIV-recombinant ALVAC vectors represent powerful polyvalent antigenic stimuli for activation and expansion of the CD8 lymphocyte response that occurs as a result of HIV infection."
4400,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"The strategy of all retroviral infections is based on establishing an equilibrium between virus replication and proviral latency in the infected host. The human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), belonging to the subfamily of lentiviridae, adds an additional level of sophistication to this general rule by encoding two regulatory genes (tat and rev) and four accessory genes (nef, vif, vpr and vpu); HIV-2, structurally similar to HIV-1 but characterized by lower pathogenicity in vivo, encodes another accessory gene, vpx. The function of these accessory genes has become clear in recent years: they serve as countermeasures to host-cell restriction factors that prevent or curtail the capacity of HIV to productively infect its target cells (typically, CD4+ T lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells). Some of the best characterized restriction factors for HIV-1 are Tripartite Motif-5α (TRIM5α), preventing infection of nonhuman primates, although not being effective in humans, and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC 3G), counteracted by the viral accessory protein Vif. In addition, several other molecules are under scrutiny for their mechanism of action and potential exploitation as novel anti-HIV agents. This review will summarize the recently emerging knowledge on these novel factors and their potential relevance for the discovery of new anti-HIV agents targeting not only the replicative, but also the latent state of HIV infection."

The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."

1306,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus associated with AIDS-like illnesses in cats. As such, FIV appears to be a feline analog of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A hallmark of HIV infection is the large degree of viral genetic diversity that can develop within an infected individual and the even greater and continually increasing level of diversity among virus isolates from different individuals. Our goal in this study was to determine patterns of FIV genetic diversity by focusing on a 684-nucleotide region encompassing variable regions V3, V4, and V5 of the FIV env gene in order to establish parallels and distinctions between FIV and HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Our data demonstrate that, like HIV-1, FIV can be separated into distinct envelope sequence subtypes (three are described here). Similar to that found for HIV-1, the pairwise sequence divergence within an FIV subtype ranged from 2.5 to 15.0%, whereas that between subtypes ranged from 17.8 to 26.2%. However, the high number of synonymous nucleotide changes among FIV V3 to V5 env sequences may also include a significant number of back mutations and suggests that the evolutionary distances among FIV subtypes are underestimated. Although only a few subtype B viruses were available for examination, the pattern of diversity between the FIV A and B subtypes was found to be significantly distinct; subtype B sequences had proportionally fewer mutations that changed amino acids, compared with silent changes, suggesting a more advanced state of adaptation to the host. No similar distinction was evident for HIV-1 subtypes. The diversity of FIV genomes within individual infected cats was found to be as high as 3.7% yet twofold lower than that within HIV-1-infected people over a comparable region of the env gene. Despite these differences, significant parallels between patterns of FIV evolution and HIV-1 evolution exist, indicating that a wide array of potentially divergent virus challenges need to be considered in FIV vaccine and pathogenesis studies."

These observations demonstrate a role for antiretroviral host factors. Several reports describe α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), the most abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor, as a potent suppressor of HIV infection and replication. We identified the normal (M) and most common deficiency-associated (S and Z) isoforms of the A1AT gene in patients infected with HIV from four multicenter cohorts. The level of disease progression in the patients was characterized and the patients were grouped into as elite controllers (EC), long-term non-progressors (LTNP), or progressors (Prog). No significant difference in the distribution of A1AT alleles was observed in the EC, LTNP, or Prog groups. However, significantly increased prevalence of the A1AT deficiency-associated S allele was observed in HIV-infected patients compared to the prevalence of S A1AT in the general population. These results suggest that deficiency in A1AT may be a risk factor for acquisition of HIV infection, but physiological A1AT concentrations do not affect disease progression after infection occurs."

The current study examined race differences in stressor burden, ways of coping, social support, and psychological distress among late middle-aged and older men living with HIV/AIDS. Self-administered surveys were completed by 72 men living with HIV/AIDS in New York City and Milwaukee, WI (mean age = 53.4 years). Older African-American and white men experienced comparable levels of stress associated with AIDS-related discrimination, AIDS-related bereavement, financial dilemmas, lack of information and support, relationship difficulties, and domestic problems. However, in responses to these stressors, older African-American men more frequently engaged in adaptive coping strategies, such as greater positive reappraisal and a stronger resolve that their future would be better. Compared to their African-American counterparts, HIV-infected older white men reported elevated levels of depression, anxiety, interpersonal hostility, and somatization. African-American men also received more support from family members and were less likely to disclose their HIV serostatus to close friends. As AIDS becomes more common among older adults, mental health-interventions will increasingly be needed for this group. The development of intervention programs for this group should pay close attention to race-related differences in sociodemographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics."
3009,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Viral replication of HIV-1 in the human body is a dynamic process. Incomplete suppression of replication during antiretroviral therapy ultimately selects for resistance that imparts an adaptive advantage to HIV-1. Therefore, the goal of antiretroviral therapy is complete suppression of viral replication. Viral suppression to below the lowest possible limits of detection has been associated with an optimal clinical response and delay of drug resistance. An ultrasensitive viral load assay with a very low threshold of detection remains our best laboratory tool to monitor the response to therapy. Patients may fail HAART for many reasons. Only when other potential causes of treatment failure are excluded should antiretroviral resistance testing be considered. Genotypic and phenotypic assays for assessing resistance are now available, and recent retrospective and prospective data support their use in clinical management as an adjunct to helping to choose among different antiretroviral drugs. Despite the growing enthusiasm for these tests, improvements in sensitivity, turnaround time, and quality control are still needed. A practitioner's decision about when to initiate or change therapy in an HIV-infected patient should depend primarily on viral load results, and not on antiretroviral resistance test results. Moreover, resistance testing is no substitute for a thorough clinical and drug history. As we approach the third decade of the HIV epidemic, we will learn how to use antiretroviral resistance tests in conjunction with (not in lieu of) proven clinical and laboratory tools."

The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed subjects in Estonia in 2008. Genotypic resistance testing for viral genomic RNA was conducted for 201 subjects tested HIV-positive between 1 April and 30 November 2008. Of 145 genotyped viral strains in newly diagnosed patients, 123 were CRF06_cpx, 2 were subtype A1 and 3 were subtype B; in 17 cases viral sequences revealed recombinant structures similar to CRF06_cpx, subtype A1 and CRF02_AG. Resistance mutations were found in 8 (5.5%) virus strains, and 3 strains were resistant to at least 2 ARV classes. A total of 2.8% of sequences harboured mutations indicating nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (M41L, M184V, M184I, T215C and T215D), 2.1% non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance (K103N, P225H) and 2.8% protease inhibitor resistance (M46I, L90M).

Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."

We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."

Complete sequence concordance between duplicates of each sample was 99.4%. Complete and partial mismatches occurred scattered throughout the PR-RT genome segment at >300 positions. Approximately 75% of the discordances involved mixtures, some of which appeared at key resistance sites. Most differences were the result of the first-round RT-PCR procedure. Inter-rater concordance for sequence analysis and assembly was >99.9%. There was no observed correlation between the number or frequency of mismatches and plasma viral loads. A separate longitudinal analysis of a single routine control sample sequenced 103 times over 9 months consistently gave highly reproducible sequences (median percentage of nucleotide discordances, 0.04%; range, 0 to 0.2%). Finally, sequence data from 168 sequential samples collected from 22 patients with long-term, predominantly wild type HIV showed that intrapatient nucleotide concordance with individual index sequences ranged from 96.5 to 100%. Together, these results confirm that sequence-based genotyping can be a precise and reliable tool for monitoring HIV drug resistance, and they suggest that efforts to reduce variability should focus on the first RT-PCR step. Consequently, the data suggest that the composition of external quality assessment panels should be based on clinical HIV isolates rather than DNA clones."

This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."

M/M are generally resistant to infection with T-cell-tropic (T-tropic) strains of HIV-1. Recently, the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 were identified as cofactors for fusion/entry of macrophage- and T-tropic strains of HIV-1, respectively. To investigate the mechanisms of resistance of M/M to T-tropic HIV-1 infection, we examined a number of subclones of the U937 promonocytic cell line. We found that certain subclones of U937 (plus clones) could, while others (minus clones) could not, support replication of T-tropic strains of HIV-1. We demonstrate that (i) both minus and plus clones support HIV-1 replication when transfected with an infectious molecular cDNA clone of a T-tropic HIV-1; (ii) minus clones do not, but plus clones do, efficiently support fusion with cells expressing HIV-1 IIIB Env; (iii) both plus and minus clones (with the exception of one clone) express physiologically functional CXCR4 protein as well as CD4 on the cell surface; (iv) introduction of CXCR4 into the CXCR4-negative clone does not restore fusogenicity with or susceptibility to T-tropic HIV-1; and (v) a ligand (stromal cell-derived factor 1) for or a monoclonal antibody (12G5) to CXCR4 does not effectively inhibit HIV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion of U937 cells. These data indicate that resistance to T-tropic HIV-1 infection of U937 minus clones occurs at fusion/ entry events and that expression of functional CXCR4 and CD4 is not a sole determinant for susceptibility to T-tropic HIV-1 infection; furthermore, they suggest that other factors are positively or negatively involved in HIV-mediated cell-to-cell fusion in U937 promonocytic cells."

Fusion of the HPRT- murine cell line BW5147 with human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or normal human blood cells resulted in a panel of human-murine T-cell hybrids. For this study, we used four hybrids containing all or several human chromosomes, which all expressed the CD4 antigen, as assessed by different anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., OKT4A, Leu-3a, and MT151) and, in addition, a variable number of other human T-cell antigens. For infection, HTLV-IIIB-infected H9 cells, pretreated with mitomycin C, and cell-free concentrated supernatants from these cells were used. In cells of inoculated cultures of the CD4+ T-cell hybrids, no viral antigen could be demonstrated. Culture supernatants of inoculated hybrids, except for an initial rise due to the virus inoculum, never showed reverse transcriptase activity above background. Cocultivation of these cell cultures with H9 cells did not result in detectable virus replication. Cocultivation of CD4-expressing hybrid cells with HIV-infected cells did not result in syncytium formation. Moreover, these hybrids were resistent to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-HIV pseudotypes. These findings imply that expression of the CD4 antigen on the cell surface is not sufficient for productive infection with HIV. The infectivity block observed in these hybrids seems to occur at the level of virus penetration, presumably at the stage of membrane fusion events."

Compared to untreated cells, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected PBMCs precultured in the presence of AY exhibited a normal rate of either mitogen-induced or recall- and superantigen-induced proliferation. After 2 weeks in the presence of the drug, the percentage of dead CD4(+) cells in HIV-1-infected cultures was comparable to that observed in uninfected cultures, while over the same time interval it increased by three- to fivefold in HIV-1-infected cultures maintained in the absence of AY. AY also stimulated by 2- to 12-fold interleukin-12 (IL-12) and (gamma interferon production. For IL-12, this effect appears to be related to an increase in corresponding IL-12 p35 and IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. Moreover, AY restored the expression of the IL-2 receptor, which was severely impaired in HIV-1-infected PBMCs. Although the drug has no direct antiviral effect (it does not significantly inhibit reverse transcriptase activity measured in vitro), it might be considered a potential therapeutic agent for HIV-infected patients, in that it may correct viral infection-related immune system defects by indirectly enhancing the level of resistance to HIV and opportunistic infections."

We set out to gain patient perceptions on factors that facilitate and challenge access and adherence to such therapy. We carried out two semi-structured interviews 12 months apart with 40 HIV-positive people drawn from three economically deprived townships in the Copperbelt, Zambia. We also conducted a focus group of 12 of these interviewees. Availability of medication in health facilities did not automatically ensure access to those in need. A prerequisite for commencing on treatment was a positive documented HIV test result, but too few HIV testing centres, fear of family and community rejection and male domination in sexual and social decision-making prevented a number from coming forward to be tested. Once within the system of care, further barriers, such as rumours of bad side-effects, inconsistent information, high costs of drugs (at the time of the first interviews), ongoing costs of additional medical tests, overcrowded systems and overworked staff, all hindered access to receiving treatment. When taken, therapy brought side-effects, the most common being increased appetite and hunger. Yet, despite these barriers and challenges many of those on treatment reported good adherence. Immediate factors, such as seeing ill people becoming well; being supported by a friend or family member; and having a watch or clock to keep to a regular regime, were important. The increase in the number of people who were expected to die but were now looking well also shifted community attitudes.

These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."

This study assessed the association between infection with different HCV genotypes on progression to AIDS and death in a cohort of men with hemophilia. Patients infected with HCV type 1 experienced a more rapid progression to both AIDS (P = .009) and death (P = .007) than did those infected with other types. This effect was largely independent of age at seroconversion, hemophilia diagnosis, and changes in CD4 cell count over the follow-up period. These results suggest an association between HCV genotype and progression of HIV disease, which, if confirmed, could have important implications for the treatment and care of patients coinfected with both HIV and HCV."

Serum levels of lipid are associated with the response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) therapy, while single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around the human interleukin 28B (IL28B) gene locus and amino acid substitutions in the core region of the HCV have been reported to affect the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy in chronic hepatitis with HCV genotype 1b infection. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between serum lipid and factors that are able to predict the efficacy of PEG-IFN/RB therapy, with specific focus on apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) in 148 subjects with chronic HCV G1b infection. Our results demonstrated that both the aa 70 substitution in the core region of the HCV and the rs8099917 SNP located proximal to the IL28B were independent factors in determining serum apoB-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. A significant association was noted between higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 1.1 × 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) and the subjects having Arg70. A significant association was also observed between subjects carrying the rs8099917 TT responder genotype and higher levels of apoB-100 (P = 6.4 × 10(-3)) and LDL cholesterol (P = 4.2 × 10(-3)). Our results suggest that apoB-100 and LDL cholesterol are markers of impaired cellular lipoprotein pathways and/or host endogenous interferon response to HCV in chronic HCV infection. In particular, serum apoB-100 concentration might be an informative marker for judging changes in HCV-associated intracellular lipoprotein metabolism in patients carrying the rs8099917 responder genotype."

In this study, to estimate the annual rate of direct liver fibrosis progression, we used analyses of paired biopsy samples from HIV/HCV-coinfected patients without prior treatment of hepatitis and assessed the possible association of fibrosis progression with certain clinical variables. We evaluated 30 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, with no history of prior treatment of hepatitis C, who underwent paired liver biopsies. All patients were under antiretroviral therapy at first and second biopsies. The average annual progression rate was 0.13 fibrosis unit/year, with 36.7% of patients defined as progressors. Liver fibrosis progression was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; P < .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P < .0340) levels over 3 times the upper limit of normal present at first biopsy. Elevated ALT and AST levels appear to be associated with more accelerated liver fibrosis progression among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. "

To further study the correlation of HCV infection and diabetes, we performed a retrospective analysis of 1,117 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and analyzed whether age, sex, race, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HCV infection, and cirrhosis were independently associated with diabetes. In addition, a case-control study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of HCV infection in a cohort of 594 diabetics and 377 clinic patients assessed for thyroid disease. In the former study after the exclusion of patients with conditions predisposing to hyperglycemia, diabetes was observed in 21% of HCV-infected patients compared with 12% of HBV-infected subjects (P =.0004). Multivariate analysis revealed that HCV infection (P =.02) and age (P =.01) were independent predictors of diabetes. In the diabetes cohort, 4.2% of patients were found to be infected with HCV compared with 1.6% of control patients (P =.02). HCV genotype 2a was observed in 29% of HCV-RNA-positive diabetic patients versus 3% of local HCV-infected controls (P <.005). In conclusion, the data suggest a relatively strong association between HCV infection and diabetes, because diabetics have an increased frequency of HCV infection, particularly with genotype 2a. Furthermore, it is possible that HCV infection may serve as an additional risk factor for the development of diabetes, beyond that attributable to chronic liver disease alone."

The fact of being born in hepatitis B and C-endemic countries or of being a long-term resident of these countries are common risk factors, especially in the case of hepatitis B. Screening for both types of infection remains low among migrants. The main purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of the risk of viral hepatitis B and C in migrants among health professionals in Côte-d'Or (Burgundy, France) and to understand the factors promoting or hindering screening. The paper presents the results of a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews with 23 healthcare providers and 8 social workers. The participating health professionals were interviewed about their involvement in the fight against hepatitis B and C and their perceptions of the risk of infection among migrants. The interviews conducted with social workers focused mostly on the conditions of social and health support provided to migrants. The study found that hepatitis B and C screening among migrants was associated with HIV screening. Screening was found to be associated with formalities relating to the legal and administrative status of migrants, the type of accommodation or housing, health professionals' knowledge of the risk factors associated with the epidemiological and social/health context in the countries of origin, and their own involvement in humanitarian aid. Migrants seeking political asylum and living in reception centers were found to be more likely to undergo screening. The findings suggest that awareness of the importance of systematic screening for hepatitis B and C in migrants from hepatitis B and C-endemic areas needs to be promoted among social workers and health professionals, as recommended by the National Prevention and Control Program (2009-2012)."

However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."

The superimposition of multiple levels of neuropathology further complicate the bedside neurologic diagnosis of an AIDS patient. This article has reviewed the variety of forms of peripheral neuropathy that may be associated with HIV infection and its treatment. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy may be produced in patients with HIV infection by neurotoxic drugs (e.g., vincristine, INH, ddC, or ddI) or by vitamin B12 deficiency or may develop in the later stages of HIV infection without identifiable cause. GBS and CIDP occur with increased frequency in early HIV infection owing to presumed autoimmunity, and these IDPs respond to plasmapheresis or prednisone, similar to HIV-seronegative patients. A limited distribution of mononeuropathy simplex or multiplex occurs in patients with CD4 counts greater than 200; the neuropathy will usually spontaneously improve in these patients. Widespread mononeuropathy multiplex may occur in patients with AIDS and CD4 counts less than 50 and is then usually caused by CMV infections; those neuropathies are usually progressive unless antiviral treatment is given. Progressive polyradiculopathy usually occurs in patients with AIDS and low CD4 counts. If the cerebrospinal fluid has a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, CMV infection is almost always present, and progression is expected unless ganciclovir therapy is promptly started. Finally, mild autonomic neuropathy is commonly present in HIV-infected patients. Protocols for the evaluation and therapy of cranial and peripheral neuropathies are presented (Figs. 6 and 7). It is unfortunate but likely that increasing numbers of ""neuro-AIDS"" patients will be encountered, not only in urban medical centers but also in general community practice. The pace at which research in the field of HIV research has proceeded is unprecedented. It is, therefore, important that neurologists stay at the forefront of investigation and clinical care of these complex disorders."
2631,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"There is a low risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for HCW through exposure in the work place. The mean risk of infection with HIV after a percutaneous exposure is 0.3%. This risk can be considerably higher depending on various factors: for example, a deep percutaneous injury or the source patient being in an end stage of HIV infection. Despite compliance with adequate precautions, it is not always possible for HCW to avoid injuries. This fact has made intervention desirable after such exposure. Zidovudine (AZT) was available as the first effective drug for treatment of HIV infection. Also, animal experiments have shown efficacy in prophylactic use of zidovudine. Therefore, since the beginning of the 90's, there has been an increased use of postexposure prophylaxis with zidovudine for exposed HCW, and during this period of use more evidence has come up to show the efficacy of PEP. In fact, a large retrospective case-control study showed a 81% reduction of HIV transmission to exposed HCW in the zidovudine treated group after percutaneous exposure. Based upon this impressive evidence and other data which indicate the efficacy of PEP, postexposure prophylaxis has become a standard procedure in the health care setting after a significant exposure to HIV. A combination of three antiretroviral drugs, usually including a protease inhibitor, is used today. Based on our current pathogenetic understanding, PEP should be started as soon as possible after exposure to HIV. There are effective tools for preventing HIV transmission in the general population. However, these tools do not provide universal protection: rupture of condoms, needle sharing and unprotected intercourse with a HIV infected person are situations at risk of HIV transmission. In spite of a different mode of exposure when compared to the health care setting, PEP in timely application is believed to be efficacious. To date there is no controlled data to support PEP in such situations; however, PEP with a combination of antiretroviral drugs after anal, oral (with ejaculation) or vaginal intercourse and needle sharing with a HIV-positive partner is recommended for a minimum of two weeks. There are reservations in recommending PEP after unprotected sexual intercourse with a partner of unknown serostatus."

To study these issues and to generate stable clones of adherent cells able to efficiently titer diverse isolates of HIV-1, we generated two panels of HeLa-CD4/CCR5 cells in which individual clones express either large or small quantities of CD4 and distinct amounts of CCR5. The panels were made by transducing parental HeLa-CD4 cells with the retroviral vector SFF-CCR5. Derivative clones expressed a wide range of CCR5 quantities which were between 7.0 x 10(2) and 1.3 x 10(5) molecules/cell as measured by binding antibodies specific for CCR5 and the chemokine [125I]MIP1beta. CCR5 was mobile in the membranes, as indicated by antibody-induced patching. In cells with a large amount of CD4, an unexpectedly low trace of CCR5 (between 7 x 10(2) and 2.0 x 10(3) molecules/cell) was sufficient for maximal susceptibility to all tested HIV-1, including primary patient macrophagetropic and T-cell-tropic isolates. Indeed, the titers as indicated by immunoperoxidase staining of infected foci were as high as the tissue culture infectious doses measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast, cells with a small amount of CD4 required a much larger quantity of CCR5 for maximal infection by macrophagetropic HIV-1 (ca. 1.0 x 10(4) to 2.0 x 10(4) molecules/cell). Cells that expressed low and high amounts of CD4 were infected with equal efficiencies when CCR5 concentrations were above threshold levels for maximal infection. Our results suggest that the concentrations of CD4 and CCR5 required for efficient infections by macrophagetropic HIV-1 are interdependent and that the requirements for each are increased when the other component is present in a limiting amount. We conclude that CD4 and CCR5 directly or indirectly interact in a concentration-dependent manner within a pathway that is essential for infection by macrophagetropic HIV-1. In addition, our results suggest that multivalent virus-receptor bonds and diffusion in the membrane contribute to HIV-1 infections."
5972,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"Considerable controversy and uncertainty have surrounded the biological function of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 nef gene product. Initial studies suggested that this early, nonstructural viral protein functioned as a negative regulatory factor; thus, it was proposed to play a role in establishing or maintaining viral latency. In contrast, studies in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)mac-infected rhesus monkeys have suggested that Nef is not a negative factor but rather plays a central role in promoting high-level viral replication and is required for viral pathogenesis in vivo. We sought to define a tissue culture system that would approximate the in vivo setting for virus infection in order to assess the role of HIV-1 Nef in viral replication. We show that infection of mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with Nef+ HIV results in enhanced replication as evidenced by earlier gag p24 expression when compared with infections performed with nef mutant viruses. Moreover, when unstimulated freshly isolated PBMC are infected with Nef+ and Nef- viruses and then subsequently activated with mitogen, the Nef-induced difference in viral replication kinetics is even more pronounced, with the Nef- viruses requiring much more time in culture for appreciable growth. A positive effect of Nef on viral replication was also observed in primary macrophages infected with a recombinant of YU-2, a patient-derived molecular clone with macrophage tropism. These positive effects of Nef on viral replication are dependent on the initial multiplicity of infection (MOI), in that infections of unstimulated PBMC at low MOI are most dependent upon intact nef for subsequent viral growth. We now provide evidence that the Nef+ HIV is more infectious than Nef- HIV from both a tissue culture infectious dose analysis, and a single-cell HIV infection assay. In the latter case, we demonstrate that infection with equivalent doses of HIV based on virion-associated gag p24 yields five- to sixfold more infected cells if Nef+ viral stocks were used. Furthermore, we find that the differential infectivity is not dependent on CD4 down-regulation as Nef+ virus produced from transfected COS cells lacking CD4 is also more infectious. However, normalization of PBMC infections to equivalent infectivity between that of the Nef+ and Nef- viruses continues to reveal delayed viral replication in the absence of Nef, suggesting that secondary viral spread in PBMC is also enhanced in Nef+ infections. We demonstrate this directly by showing a 13-15-fold increase in infectivity of PBMC-derived Nef+ HIC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

HIV infects multiple cells in the liver and might potentially alter the life cycle of HBV, although evidence to date is limited. Unique mutations in HBV have been defined in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals and might directly alter pathogenesis. In addition, an impaired HBV-specific T-cell immune response is likely to be important. The roles of microbial translocation, immune activation and increased hepatic stellate cell activation will be important areas for future study."

The analysis was performed on 1221 HIV-1 B-subtype infected patients with an available V3 sequence (all maraviroc naive). Of them, 532 were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive and 689 ART experienced. Tropism determination was performed by using the geno2pheno (co-receptor) algorithm set at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10% and 2%. Potential associations of FPR with CD4 cell count and viraemia were evaluated. Association of V3 mutations with genotypic-determined tropism was also evaluated according to different FPR ranges. About 26% of patients (either ART naive or ART experienced) were infected by X4-tropic viruses (using the classical 10% FPR cut-off). However, a significantly lower proportion of ART-naive patients had FPR ≤ 2% in comparison with ART-experienced patients (4.9% vs. 12.6%, respectively, p <0.001). The risk of advanced HIV-1 infection (with CD4 cell count ≤ 200 cells/mm(3)) was significantly greater in X4-infected patients, either ART-naive (OR (95% CI)), 4.2 (1.8-9.2); p 0.0006) or ART-experienced (2.3 (1.4-3.6); p 0.0003), with FPR set at 2% (but not at 10%). This finding was confirmed by multivariable logistic analysis. No relationship was found between viraemia and FPR ≤2%. Some X4-related mutations were significantly associated with FPR ≤2% (ART-naive patients, S11R, Y21V, G24K and G24R, p ≤0.001; ART-experienced patients, Y7K, S11R, H13Y, p ≤0.002). In conclusion, these findings show that within the context of genotypically-assessed CXCR4 tropism, FPR ≤2% defines (far better than 10%-FPR) a viral population associated with low CD4 rank, with potentially greater cytopathic effect, and with more advanced disease."

These early events of signal transduction culminate in late events of lymphocyte activation, namely, DNA synthesis, lymphokine production, and cellular proliferation. In this study we examined the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on changes in membrane potential and [Ca2+]i levels. The membrane potentials were markedly decreased (depolarized) in T cell lines infected with HIV (H9/HTLV IIIb) and did not respond normally to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-T3 (anti-CD3) monoclonal antibody compared to uninfected H9 cell line. The basal [Ca2+]i levels in H9/HTLV IIIb cells were increased in comparison to those in H9 cells; however, there was very little further increase in [Ca2+]i in H9/HTLV IIIb cells following activation with PHA or anti-T3 monoclonal antibody. This is in contrast to a significant rise in [Ca2+]i in H9 cells following similar stimulation. These data demonstrate abnormalities in the plasma membrane potential and [Ca2+]i levels in chronically infected T cells with HIV. These abnormalities in signal transduction of the T-cell activation pathway could be responsible for T-cell dysfunction in patients with HIV infection."

We used sensitive real-time quantitative PCR assays to measure HBV DNA in samples from a case-control study consisting of 60 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 53 cirrhotic patients and 129 HCC cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of cirrhosis and HCC associated with HBV-DNA levels and HBV e antigenemia (HBeAg) detection (a surrogate marker for viral replication). Detectable HBV viremia and HBeAg positivity were both significantly associated with cirrhosis (increasing risk by fourfold and 11-fold respectively) and with HCC (increasing risk by sixfold and threefold respectively). HBV-DNA levels were significantly higher in both HCC cases and cirrhotic patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (P < 0.01 for both). High-level HBV DNA (>10,000 copies/mL) was strongly associated with both HCC and cirrhosis (17- and 39-fold increased risk). Lower level HBV viremia (200-10,000 copies/mL) conferred a significant risk of HCC, although the association with cirrhosis was not significant. In conclusion, we find that high HBV-DNA levels are strongly associated with the serious sequelae of HBV infection, independent of HBeAg status. While risk for cirrhosis and for HCC notably increases at HBV-DNA levels >or=10,000 copies/mL, low-level viremia was also associated with significant risk for HCC."

In the past decades, better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection and of the development of many powerful antiviral agents has allowed us to improve therapeutic efficacy. Among these agents, nucleos(t)ide analogs are important and potent viral suppressors. However, when administered alone, they are not able to permanently eradicate HBV, and long-term maintenance therapy is required for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, prolonged treatment is frequently associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Before an 'ideal' drug(s), or drug combination, with optimal antiviral efficacy and negligible rates of drug resistance becomes available, the on-treatment monitoring approach using serum HBV DNA level as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy and drug resistance is useful. However, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have low income economies, insufficient medical care systems, and low awareness of the disease among the general population and government officers. The easy approach of the road-map concept using an affordable drug to treat chronic HBV infection is more important in this region. There is already evidence that the long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection can be improved under well-managed antiviral therapy. Profound and long-lasting suppression of HBV replication, either maintained on-therapy or sustained after stopping therapy, has been identified as the key determinant for achieving the goals of therapy, for reducing liver damage, and for preventing development of cirrhosis and/ or hepatocellular carcinoma."

We designed and tested a new HIV-2 primer couple that amplifies both the HIV-2 ROD strain and HIV-1 LAV/BRU strain. These HIV-2 primers were used to quantified an HIV-2 standard comparatively to a standard widely used in proviral DNA HIV-1 quantification, i.e., the 8E5 cell line transfected by a single defective integrated provirus of HIV-1 BRU/LAV by cell. The primers and probe used to quantify HIV-2 DNA are located in a long terminal repeat (LTR) region with low variability. These primers amplify both HIV-2 subtypes A and B.

Abdominal fat content did not change, and subcutaneous fat depletion was even more pronounced >1 year after the switch.

Here, we investigated cell proliferation, as measured by expression of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen, in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte subpopulations before and during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In untreated HIV-1 infection, both the percentage and number of Ki-67(+) CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes were significantly increased, compared with values obtained from healthy individuals. A more than 10-fold increase in the percentage of dividing naive CD4(+) T cells in the blood was found when the number of these cells were below 100 per microL. HAART induced an immediate decline in Ki-67 antigen expression, despite often very low CD4(+) T-cell numbers, arguing against increased proliferation being a homeostatic response. After approximately 24 weeks of HAART treatment, a transient increase in the number of proliferating cells was seen, but only in the CD4(+) CD27(+) memory pool. In the CD8(+) T-cell compartment, the number of dividing cells was elevated 20- to 25-fold. This increase was most notable in the CD27(+) CD 45RO(+) and CD27(-) CD45RO(+) memory CD8(+) T-cell pool, corresponding with the degree of expansion of these subsets. Reduction of plasma HIV-RNA load by HAART was accompanied by a decrease in numbers and percentages of dividing cells in all CD8(+) T-cell subsets.

A new study in rhesus monkeys treated with a DNA vaccine (Barouch et al.) demonstrates that a powerful vaccine-induced CD8(+) cytolytic T cell response reduces the amount of virus in the blood to very low levels preventing the drastic decrease in CD4(+) T helper cells and subsequent immunodeficiency. As the Perspective authors explain, vaccinating HIV patients that are receiving HAART may enable HIV levels to be permanently brought under control such that the drug treatment can eventually be stopped."

The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has, however, dramatically increased survival of patients infected with HIV. These patients now survive to develop metabolic complications of HIV infection and its treatment, including increased predisposition to atherosclerotic disease. HIV infection is normally associated with hypocholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, low plasma HDL-cholesterol as well as alterations in other cardiovascular risk factors including inflammatory markers, clotting factors, homocysteine, apolipoproteins, lipoprotein (a), oxidative stress and non-esterified fatty acids. The use of HAART is, in particular, associated with dyslipidaemia and lipodystrophy with underlying insulin resistance and associated glucose intolerance. This article explores the metabolic abnormalities associated with increased cardiovascular risk that occur in HIV infection before and after antiretroviral therapy. The laboratory investigation and clinical management of HIV-associated dyslipidaemia and lipodystrophy will be discussed."

Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection. The outbreak stresses the need for appropriate and generally applied standard procedures in nursing homes to prevent bloodborne pathogens."

However, the mechanisms by which HBV evades host immunity and maintains chronic infection are largely unknown. Here, we revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is activated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HBV-infected patients, and HBV stimulates MMP-9 expression in macrophages and PBMCs isolated from healthy individuals. MMP-9 plays important roles in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix and in the facilitation of tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. MMP-9 also regulates respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication, but the mechanism underlying such regulation is unknown. We further demonstrated that MMP-9 facilitates HBV replication by repressing the interferon (IFN)/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, IFN action, STAT1/2 phosphorylation, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Moreover, MMP-9 binds to type I IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and facilitates IFNAR1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, subcellular distribution, and degradation to interfere with the binding of IFANR1 to IFN-α. Thus, we identified a novel positive-feedback regulation loop between HBV replication and MMP-9 production. On one hand, HBV activates MMP-9 in infected patients and leukocytes. On the other hand, MMP-9 facilitates HBV replication through repressing IFN/JAK/STAT signaling, IFNAR1 function, and IFN-α action. Therefore, HBV may take the advantage of MMP-9 function to establish or maintain chronic infection."

The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections.

Syringe surveillance for HIV yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%, respectively, and provided a reasonable estimate of the prevalence of HIV among participants.

However, there is a strong link between HCV infection and tobacco abuse, a major risk factor for the development of OLD. In this study we analyzed clinical, laboratory and spirometric data from 1068 study participants to assess whether HCV infection, viremia, or HCV-associated end organ damage were associated with OLD. Demographics, risk behavior, serologic status for HCV and HIV, and spirometric measurements were collected from a cross-sectional analysis of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) study, an observational cohort of IDUs followed in Baltimore, MD since 1988. Of 1,068 participants, 890 (83%) were HCV positive and 174 (16%) met spirometric criteria for OLD. Factors independently associated with OLD were age and BMI. HCV infection, viral load and HCV-associated end organ damage were similar in participants with and without OLD. In summary, there was no independent association between markers of HCV exposure, chronicity, viremia, or HCV-associated end-organ damage with OLD. Our findings support the strong correlation between HCV status, injection drug use, and smoking. These data suggest that HCV may not be a sole contributor to the increased prevalence of OLD described in previous studies of HCV-infected individuals."

HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."

However, it is unclear whether HBV mutation patterns might differ between co-infected and mono-infected patients. To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-naïve co-infected and 31 treatment-naïve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients.

Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively).

The prognostic significance of these parameters during primary HIV-1 infection, however, remains largely unknown. In a cohort of 53 male study subjects (age, 33 +/- 7 years), who consecutively presented with primary HIV-1 infection, we analyzed the relationship between early plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, beta2-microglobulin, and p24-antigen levels determined in the first 3 months and subsequent plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ T-cell counts 6 to 12 months after onset of primary symptoms. Peak, nadir, and median HIV-1 RNA levels in the first 30 days were already significantly associated with HIV-1 RNA levels at 6 to 12 months (p = .02, p < .0001, and p = .01, respectively). Similarly, early nadir and median CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts in the first 30 days showed a significant relationship with CD4+ T-cell counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .009 and p = .0008, respectively). Study subjects with an early decline of CD4+ counts to <500 cells/microl had an eightfold higher risk that CD4+ counts were <500 cells/microl at 1 year. Of all evaluated virologic parameters, only nadir HIV-1 RNA at 76 days predicted CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months (p = .006). Early HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4+ counts are already associated with the time course of those parameters 6 to 12 months after onset of symptoms. Nadir viral load was the strongest predictor of HIV-1 RNA levels as well as of CD4+ counts at 6 to 12 months. An early decline of CD4+ T lymphocytes may be a useful clinical prognostic marker for rapid disease progression."

We conducted a prospective cohort study over 1 year in a group of 68 HIV-1-infected infants and children to determine whether hepatitis B surface antigenemia, neopterin, and beta 2-microglobulin (B2M) predicted death. Among the 44 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) subjects at enrollment, 13 (30%) died during 1 year of follow-up. In comparison, two of 24 (8%) HBsAg-negative subjects died (RR = 7.7; p = 0.05). Higher initial serum concentrations of neopterin and B2M were negatively associated with survival. After stratifying by baseline clinical evidence of HIV-related disease, survival was negatively associated with HBsAg+ status (p = 0.04) in 33 children in stage P-2, adjusting for age, serum neopterin, and serum B2M levels. The results of this study suggest that serum neopterin is a marker for severity of clinical illness and that HBsAg+ status increases the mortality rate among children with clinical evidence of HIV infection."

As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."

Two partners were already infected when seen 18 and 34 months after sexual contact began following the infectious transfusion. Four of 17 initially seronegative partners seroconverted during 23 person-years of observation. The recipient's clinical status, mononuclear cell subset variations, and time trend in CD4+ counts had no association with transmission. Individual plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads were stable during observation, and sexual transmission was not attributable to an upward trend or transient burst in viremia. However, recipients who transmitted HIV-1 to their sexual partners had higher mean viral RNA levels than did nontransmitting recipients (4.3 vs. 3.6 log10 copies/ml; p = 0.05). Although this series was small, the prospective observations suggest that viral load was the only characteristic in the recipient that contributed to heterosexual infectiousness."

The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."

This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."

We established an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay using a recombinant CD81-claudin-1 (CLDN1) fusion protein to detect and quantify Abs directed against extracellular epitopes of the HCV CD81-CLDN1 coreceptor complex. The presence of anti-receptor Abs was studied in serum of patients from a well-defined cohort of a single-source HCV outbreak of pregnant women and several control groups, including uninfected pregnant women, patients with chronic hepatitis B and D virus (HBV/HDV) infection, and healthy individuals. Virus-neutralizing activity of Abs was determined using recombinant cell culture-derived HCV (HCVcc). Our results demonstrate that HCV-infected patients have statistically significantly higher anti-CD81/CLDN1 Ab titers during the early phase of infection than controls.

We characterized the immunogenicity of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), one of the more promising alternative smallpox vaccines, in a cohort of 10 chronically HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Nine subjects received smallpox vaccination as children while one subject was never vaccinated against smallpox. All the subjects had CD4 counts >400 cells/mm(3) and 8 out of 10 had undetectable viral loads. MVA was able to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses in the majority of individuals. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were mainly of the IgG class while T cells specific to vaccinia were predominantly CD8(+). The immune responses were maintained over 1 year. Similar vaccinia specific humoral immune responses were observed when our cohort of HIV-1-infected individuals was compared to smallpox-vaccinated healthy subjects.

HIV clearly exacerbates HCV infection and accelerates progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is debate over whether HCV influences the natural history of HIV. Given the high prevalence of coinfection and the accelerated liver damage, HCV treatment has become a priority in these patients. There are new data on pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for HCV in coinfected patients. The therapy is well tolerated and safe, although it appears to be slightly less effective than in monoinfected patients.

In comparison with the HC, fewer CD3(-) CD56(+) and CD244(+) NK cells and CD3(+) CD8(+) T cells, lower frequencies of cytokine(+) CD4(+) T cells, and more CD3(+) CD4(+), CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+), CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(low), and CD8(+) PD-1(+) T cells were detected in CHB patients. Treatment with LDT increased the numbers of NK and CD8(+) cells and the frequencies of cytokine(+) CD4(+) T cells but reduced the numbers of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+), CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(low), and CD8(+) PD-1(+) T cells in CHB patients. The frequencies of cytokine(+) CD4(+) T cells were negatively associated with the levels of serum HBV DNA, ALT, and AST. Thus, treatment with LDT inhibits HBV replication, modulates T and NK cell immunity, and improves liver function in Chinese patients with CHB."

Although anti-viral therapies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) have dramatically progressed during the past decade, the estimated number of people chronically infected with HBV and/or HCV is ~370 million, and hepatitis virus-associated hepatocarcinogenesis is a serious health concern worldwide. Understanding the mechanism of virus-associated carcinogenesis is crucial toward both treatment and prevention, and the recently developed whole genome/exome sequencing analysis using next-generation sequencing technologies has contributed to unveiling the landscape of genetic and epigenetic aberrations in not only tumor tissues but also the background liver tissues underlying chronic liver damage caused by hepatitis virus infection. Several major mechanisms underlie the genetic and epigenetic aberrations in the hepatitis virus-infected liver, such as the generation of reactive oxidative stress, ectopic expression of DNA mutator enzymes, and dysfunction of the DNA repair system. In addition, direct oncogenic effects of hepatitis virus, represented by the integration of HBV-DNA, are observed in infected hepatocytes. Elucidating the whole picture of genetic and epigenetic alterations, as well as the mechanisms of tumorigenesis, will facilitate the development of efficient treatment and prevention strategies for hepatitis virus-associated HCC."

In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified low-frequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drug-resistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants."

Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."

The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."

In recent years it has become evident that people living with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and it is expected that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease will rise accordingly. To investigate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with HIV, we conducted a retrospective observational analysis using the clinical database of a large centre (Institute of Tropical Medicine) in the urban area of Antwerp, Belgium. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease among HIV infected subjects was found to be 3.0%. The development of chronic kidney disease was associated with age above 50 years, lower CD4 cell counts and Caucasian origin. Screening for chronic renal disorders and prevention of evolution toward chronic renal failure is a crucial challenge in the management of people living with HIV/AIDS."

It was previously reported that Mashhad, in northeastern Iran, is a new endemic region of HTLV-I. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of HTLV-I in Sabzevar, located in the southeast of Mashhad. In this cross-sectional study 1445 individuals were selected by multistage cluster sampling. Serum samples were screened for anti-HTLV-I antibody using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); all of the ELISA-positive samples were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Long terminal repeat (LTR) sequencing was carried out to determine the type of HTLV-I in Sabzevar. In the primary screening by ELISA, 26/1445 (1.8%) of those sampled were reactive for HTLV-I antibody. Twenty-four out of 26 samples were confirmed HTLV-I infection by PCR (24/1445). The overall prevalence of HTLV-I infection in Sabzevar is 1.66%. The prevalence of the virus infection in men and women was 2.42% (11/455) and 1.31% (13/989), respectively. Seroprevalence was associated with age, increasing significantly among those older than 30 years (p=0.015), and a history of surgery (p=0.002), imprisonment (p=0.018), and hospitalization (p=0.005). Three out of 24 positive HTLV-I samples were selected for sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of LTR. The results showed that HTLV-I in Sabzevar belonged to the cosmopolitan subtype. The present study showed Sabzevar is a new endemic area for HTLV-I infection. Our study emphasizes that systemic HTLV-I screening of blood donors in Sabzevar and other cities in Khorasan province is important and should be taken into account."

To identify virus attenuations that may contribute to slower rates of disease progression, the full-length viral genomes from primary isolates of six slow progressing HIV-positive children were sequenced. Proviral DNA was extracted from cocultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to PCR amplify, sequence, and extensively analyze the near full-length genomes and LTR regions. All primary HIV-1 isolates were HIV-1 subtype C throughout their genome, and amino acid (AA) sequence analysis revealed open reading frames for all genes. However, all isolates had at least one unusual gene/protein. For example, isolate LT5 had a 2AA insertion in the Vpr mitochondriotoxic domain. Isolate LT21 contained an additional 5AA in the C-terminus of tat exon 2, while integrase in isolate LT39 had an additional 4AA at the C-terminus. Rev from isolates LT45 and LT46 did not have the characteristic subtype C 16AA truncation, and in addition, had a further 3AA. Furthermore, altered functional domains were noted in several isolates, such as the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA phosphorylation site in Nef (LT5), a Vpr mutation involved in decreased proapoptotic activity (all isolates), and the Nef ExxxLL motif involved in the interaction with AP-1 and AP-2 (LT46). The slower HIV-1 disease progression in these six children may be attributed to altered protein functions. For example, LT46 Nef is unable to bind AP-1 and AP-2 and therefore is inactive on CD4 endocytosis. The biological relevance of these findings requires further investigation."

TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission."
5462,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"T lymphocytes and immunoregulatory cytokines may be important in the host response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines (interleukin [IL]-2, interferon gamma [IFN-gamma]) are required for host antiviral immune responses, including cytotoxic T-cell generation and natural killer cell activation, while T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines (IL-4,IL-10) can inhibit the development of these effector mechanisms. In this study, the serum levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in patients (n = 23) infected with HCV were measured and compared with biochemical (alanine transaminase [ALT]) and viral (HCV RNA) indicators of infection. Serial cytokine levels were measured in a subset of 11 patients at 1 and 12 weeks during and at 1 week after interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) therapy (n = 33 samples). Levels of circulating IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in HCV patients versus normal controls (128 vs. 25 pg/mL, 3,045 vs. 29 pg/mL, 2,949 vs. 18 pg/mL, and 307 vs. 24 pg/mL respectively; P < .01). Treatment with IFN-alpha decreased the levels of IL-4 (321 +/- 224 pg/mL), and IL-10 (1,011 +/- 344 pg/mL), which paralleled a decrease in HCV RNA (114 +/- 27 vs. 25 +/- 20 Eq/ml X 10(5), pre- vs. post-IFN-alpha [12 weeks];P <.05). These findings indicate that an activated T-cell response, as manifest by increased circulating immunoregulatory cytokines, is present in patients with HCV liver disease. Furthermore, treatment with HCV liver disease. Furthermore, treatment with IFN-alpha diminishes the Th2 cytokine response. Thus, modulation of T-cell function and cytokine production may be one mechanism whereby IFN-alpha therapy results in reduced viral burden."

However, in many patients the profound suppression of viral replication is short lived, particularly if patients have been treated with sequential monotherapies in the past, have been infected with a highly drug resistant isolate of HIV-1, or have temporarily discontinued therapy as a ""holiday"" or because of drug intolerance. In addition, life-long adherence to maintenance HAART will probably be required even in responding patients with undetectable viremia because of the reservoirs of latently infected cells that can persist for years. Gene therapy through the introduction of anti-retroviral ""resistance"" genes into CD4(+) T cells is one approach that could give long term protection to these HIV-1 susceptible cells in vivo. We have explored this approach by developing intrabodies to the critical HIV-1 transactivator protein, Tat that is absolutely required for HIV-1 replication. This provocative treatment approach, that will be tested in a clinical gene therapy trial, sets the groundwork for determining if anti-Tat intrabody gene therapy together with HAART can provide a treatment strategy for the immune reconstitution of HIV-1-infected patients with advanced disease."

Circulating Tat activates CD4 T cells, permitting HIV replication and sustained viremia. Safety, immunogenicity and antiretroviral potential of TUTI-16 were explored in a randomized double-blind dose-escalating study in asymptomatic treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected subjects. TUTI-16 was safe, with mild local and systemic injection-related adverse reactions, but the antibody response was barely detectable. Surprisingly, a highly statistically significant reduction of HIV-1 viral load was found in the lowest 30 μg vaccine dose group (p < 0.01) but not at the higher doses. We posited that an anti-Tat antibody response below the limit of detection inhibited HIV viral load at this dose, an effect nullified at higher vaccine doses by activating cytokines induced by adjuvant components in TUTI-16. To clarify this immunogenicity/activation conundrum open label immunogenicity studies were performed in healthy HIV uninfected and aviremic ART-controlled HIV-infected subjects. These established that (1) healthy HIV negative subjects had robust antibody responses, maximal with 1 mg TUTI-16, (2) ART-controlled aviremic HIV infected subjects had similarly robust antibody responses, and (3) adjuvant-induced increases of HIV viral load did not occur in the presence of ART. These studies provided us a basis for the design of a protocol to explore the therapeutic potential of TUTI-16 vaccination to provide drug free control of HIV-1 viremia."

Although the cysteine-rich domain is a potential site for Zn(2+) binding, it is controversial whether Zn(2+) is substantially essential for the structure and activities of the Tat protein. To study the significance of Zn(2+) in the cysteine-rich domain of the Tat protein particularly released to the extracellular space, we raised the monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5A4, which has an attractive property of recognizing the Zn(2+)-binding Tat(20-41) peptide but not the apo-Tat(20-41) peptide. MAb 5A4 inhibited the trans-activation of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) in HeLa-CD4-LTR/beta-gal cells induced by treatment with the recombinant Tat protein, indicating that MAb 5A4 can recognize the full-length Tat protein and inhibit its trans-activity. The antibody also inhibited the apoptosis of Jurkat cells induced by treatment with the released native-Tat-protein-containing supernatant from the culture of HIV-1(JRFL)-infected cells. These results suggest that Zn(2+), whose structure is closely associated with not only the trans-activation of HIV-LTR but also the induction of apoptosis, binds to the extracellular native Tat protein. The Zn(2+)-binding cysteine-rich domain therefore can be a molecular target in the development of an anti-Tat vaccine and agents for the control of extracellular-Tat-protein-mediated pathogenesis leading to the progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome."

The bulk of infection in this group probably occurs with HTLV-II, with a lower prevalence of HTLV-I. HTLV-I is known to cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-II has not been proven to cause any human pathology, but may be immunosuppressive and is almost indistinguishable serologically from HTLV-I. As with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), infection with these viruses is likely to be lifelong and the disease may have a latent period of many years. Unlike HIV, HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II are not likely to be transmitted from mother to child prenatally, and usually require breast-feeding for vertical transmission. It is likely that HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II has been prevalent in IDUs for far longer than the HIV epidemic. HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II are relevant to the AIDS epidemic in that they may function as biologic markers of behavioral risk status for HIV infection in IDUs or their sexual partners, and they may accelerate the course of HIV infection in persons coinfected with HTLV-I and/or HTLV-II and HIV. Coinfection will be more likely as the HIV epidemic progresses. Pregnant addicts entering outpatient methadone maintenance treatment in San Francisco County or Contra Costa County during 1990 were found to have an HTLV-II prevalence of 21% (n = 24). Important issues in counseling infected methadone patients are described."

However, many patients still initiate treatment at very late stages. To understand the distribution of baseline CD4 and factors associated with late antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, the National Free ART Database was retrospectively reviewed and a total of 49,321 HIV/AIDS patients were identified in this study based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≥18; (2) initiated HAART between 1 July, 2006 and 31 December, 2009; (3) have recorded baseline CD4 cell count. This study showed that although both the median and mean baseline CD4 increased consistently over the study period, there were still about 30% of HIV/AIDS patients accessing ART at a very late stage (CD4 ≤ 50 µl) in 2009. Risk factors for late ART access included being male, single, having a short time interval between HIV diagnosis and treatment, and being infected through heterosexual contact. Being infected through injection drug use and homosexual contact were protective. Transmission route and marriage status showed different effects in a gender stratified analysis. A strengthened HIV testing and screening program is the key to improving the accessibility of ART and populations that are vulnerable to sexual transmission of HIV should be the primary target of the program."

However, despite prolonged treatment with HAART, the persistence of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs harboring transcriptionally silent but replication-competent proviruses represents the major hurdle to virus eradication. These latently infected cells are a permanent source for virus reactivation and lead to a rebound of the viral load after interruption of HAART. Therefore, a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating proviral latency and reactivation should lead to rational strategies aimed at purging these cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. This review summarizes our current knowledge and understanding of the elements involved in HIV-1 transcriptional reactivation: (1) the site of integration; (2) the transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines (such as TNFalpha) and binds to two kappaB sites in the HIV-1 promoter region; (3) the specific remodeling of a single nucleosome (called nuc-1 and located immediately downstream of the HIV-1 transcription start site under latency conditions) upon activation of the HIV-1 promoter; (4) post-translational acetylation of histones and of non-histone proteins (following treatment with deacetylases inhibitors, which induce viral transcription and nuc-1 remodeling); and (5) the viral trans-activator Tat, which promotes transcription by mediating the recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter of histone-modifying enzymes and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes required for nucleosome disruption and transcriptional processivity. Finally, this review highlights experimental therapies aimed at administrating HIV-1 gene expression activators (such as HDAC inhibitors) combined with an effective HAART in order to reactivate and decrease/eliminate the pool of latently HIV-1-infected cellular reservoirs"
1455,0.0016666666666666668,1.0000,"With the advent of the combination antiretroviral therapy era (cART), the development of AIDS has been largely limited in the USA. Unfortunately, despite the development of efficacious treatments, HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) can still develop, and as many HIV-1 positive individuals age, the prevalence of HAND is likely to rise because HAND manifests in the brain with very low levels of virus. However, the mechanism producing this viral disorder is still debated. Interestingly, HIV-1 infection exposes neurons to proteins including Tat, Nef, and Vpr which can drastically alter mitochondrial properties. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been posited to be a cornerstone of the development of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we investigated mitochondria in an animal model of HAND. Using an HIV-1 transgenic rat model expressing seven of the nine HIV-1 viral proteins, mitochondrial functional and proteomic analysis were performed on a subset of mitochondria that are particularly sensitive to cellular changes, the neuronal synaptic mitochondria. Quantitative mass spectroscopic studies followed by statistical analysis revealed extensive proteome alteration in this model paralleling mitochondrial abnormalities identified in HIV-1 animal models and HIV-1-infected humans. Novel mitochondrial protein changes were discovered in the electron transport chain (ETC), the glycolytic pathways, mitochondrial trafficking proteins, and proteins involved in various energy pathways, and these findings correlated well with the function of the mitochondria as assessed by a mitochondrial coupling and flux assay. By targeting these proteins and proteins upstream in the same pathway, we may be able to limit the development of HAND."

We examined all-cause, liver-related and drug-related mortality and excess risk of death from these causes in a large cohort of HCV-monoinfected and HIV-coinfected persons in Scotland. The study population consisted of 20,163 persons confirmed to be infected with hepatitis C through laboratory testing in Scotland between 1991 and 2005. Records with sufficient identifiers were linked to the General Register Office for Scotland death register to retrieve associated mortality data, and were further linked to a national database of HIV-positive individuals to determine coinfection status. A total of 1715 HCV monoinfected and 305 HIV coinfected persons died of any cause during the follow-up period (mean of 5.4 and 6.4 years, respectively). Significant excess mortality was observed in both HCV monoinfected and HIV coinfected populations from liver-related underlying causes (standardised mortality ratios of 25, 95% CI = 23-27; and 37, 95% CI = 26-52 for the two groups, respectively) and drug-related causes (25, 95% CI = 23-27; 39, 95% CI = 28-53. The risk of death from hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease, or from a drug-related cause, was greatly increased compared with the general Scottish population, with the highest standardised mortality ratio observed for hepatocellular carcinoma in the monoinfected group (70, 95% CI = 57-85). This study has revealed considerable excess mortality from liver- and drug-related causes in the Scottish HCV-diagnosed population; these data are crucial to inform on the clinical management, and projected future public health burden, of HCV infection."

We used hyperbranched multidisplacement amplification for whole gene amplification (MDA-WGA) plus two rounds of PCR to amplify housekeeping sequences (HK(+)) and, in HK(+) samples, to amplify HIV-1 gag, nef, and pol sequences. Sample size and, in single neurons, MDA-WGA correlated with housekeeping gene amplification (P < 0.05), whereas patient group and postmortem interval did not (P > 0.05). Neuronal viral sequences correlated with HIVE (43% vs. 13% and 0 in non-HIVE and controls, respectively) and, in HIVE cases, with perineuronal CD8(+) T lymphocytes (70% in CD8(+) samples vs. 37% of CD8(-) samples). Our results suggest that MDA-WGA is a useful technique when analyzing DNA from single cells from autopsy brains, supporting prior studies that show that neurons may contain HIV-1 neuronal sequences in vivo. The association between neuronal infection and perineuronal CD8(+) T cells supports our hypothesis that these cells specifically traffic to infected neurons but raises the possibility that CD8(+) T cells, if infected, could transmit virus to neurons."

Furthermore, the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) plus lamivudine therapy on oxidative stress was also investigated. Nineteen patients with acute hepatitis B virus (AHBV) infection, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHBV) infection, 24 inactive HBsAg carriers and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. In control and patient groups, serum alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were measured. In CHBV group, after IFN-alpha plus lamivudine therapy for 6 months, these parameters were measured again. In all patient groups erythrocyte MDA levels were detected higher than control group (p < 0.05). Activity of CuZn-SOD was found to be the highest in AHBV (p < 0.05), and the lowest before the treatment in CHBV group (p < 0.05) compared with other groups. Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the highest in AHBV compared with inactive HBsAg carriers (p < 0.05) and CHBV group before treatment (p < 0.05). Activity of GSH-Px was found to be the lowest in CHBV group before treatment compared with other groups (p < 0.05). In CHBV group there was a significant decrease of MDA levels after treatment (p < 0.05) while there was a significant increase in activity of CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px compared with pretreatment levels (p < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was determined between MDA values and serum ALT levels, before and after the treatment (p < 0.05). Detection of the increase of MDA levels which is a product of lipid peroxidation in all patient groups, indicates that the oxidative stress is increased in HBV infection. Correlation between the levels of erythrocyte MDA levels and serum ALT levels supports the hypothesis concerning the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of HBV infection. Insufficiency of antioxidant capacity in CHBV and inactive HBsAg carrier groups may lead to progression of disease and results in fibrosis. Treatment with IFN-alpha plus lamivudine causes a decrease in products of lipid peroxidation and shows antioxidant activity via increasing the antioxidant enzymes. These data suggest that the addition of antioxidant agents to IFN-alpha and lamivudin combination therapy may be useful in CHBV treatment. Further in-vitro and in-vivo studies are required to enlighten the role of antioxidants on HBV disease progression and treatment."

Here, we reviewed serology screening for anti-HIV in a 1-year period at the PreAdmission Clinic of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the largest Thai Red Cross Society hospital. A total of 463 patients, 215 males and 248 females, were investigated, and four cases (all males) were determined to have anti-HIV seropositivity. The infection rate was 0.86%, similar to that of previous surveys of the general population. According to our study, 75% of the HIV-seropositive patients did not know their HIV status before our screening, and most of the infected cases (50%) underwent sex change surgery. The patients who underwent elective surgery in our clinic were usually anti-HIV seronegative. The risk group of our patients seems to be the sexual dysphorian patients who underwent sex change surgery. Additional screening tests for other infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus is recommended. However, in a setting where HIV infection is common, such as in Thailand, the physician should practice universal precautions since any serological test poses dangers during diagnosis."

Although the HBV genotype distribution has been determined in some parts of South Central Asia, no survey has been conducted to determine the HBV genotype in Afghanistan. Twelve Afghan patients infected with HBV living in Afghanistan were enrolled in this study. Partial HBsAg and basic core promoter, precore, and core (BCP/preC/C) regions were amplified and subjected for direct sequencing. In parallel, precore G1896A mutation was also determined by an amplification-created restriction site method. Results revealed HBV genotype D (95% bootstrap value), sub-genotype D1 (98% bootstrap value), and subtype ayw2 in all Afghan isolates. Afghan isolates clustered in a separate branch in the D1 sub-genotype called D1', while supported by 82% bootstrap value. The percentage of intra-genotypic distance among Afghan isolates was 1.05% and inter-genotypic distance with the other genotype D was 2.87% and with other genotypes was 7.50%-11.1%. The wild-type, mixed infection, and precore mutant were found in six, two, and four HBV isolates, respectively. The A1762T/G1764A BCP dual mutation was found in one isolate. Three isolates presented single mutation in the BCP dual mutation region, whereas two showed a novel G1764T mutation. In conclusion, this preliminary study revealed HBV genotype D, sub-genotype D1, and subtype ayw2 of HBV among hepatitis B infected patients from Afghanistan. Further investigation should be carried out."

The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently, more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication, but it has not been exploited, primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty, we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM, the best compounds had low micromolar IC(50) values against the RNAseH, and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM. Recombinant HBV genotype D RNAseH was more sensitive to inhibition than genotype H. This study demonstrates that recombinant HBV RNAseH suitable for low-throughput antiviral drug screening has been produced. The high percentage of compounds developed against the HIV RNAseH and integrase that were active against the HBV RNAseH indicates that the extensive drug design efforts against these HIV enzymes can guide anti-HBV RNAseH drug discovery. Finally, differential inhibition of HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs indicates that viral genetic variability will be a factor during drug development."

Gall, B. Ferns, C. Morris, S. Watson, M. Cotten, M. Robinson, N. Berry, D. Pillay, and P. Kellam, J Clin Microbiol 50:3838-3844, 2012, doi:10.1128/JCM.01516-12), we developed a robust methodology for amplification of two large fragments of viral genome covering about 80% of the unique HIV-1 genome sequence. Importantly, this method can be applied to both viral RNA and proviral DNA amplification templates, allowing genotyping in HIV-infected subjects with suppressed viral loads (e.g., subjects on antiretroviral therapy [ART]). The two amplicons cover critical regions across the HIV-1 genome (including pol and env), allowing analysis of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and virus entry inhibitors. The two amplicons generated span 7,124 bp, providing substantial sequence length and numbers of informative sites for comprehensive phylogenic analysis and greater refinement of viral linkage analyses in HIV prevention studies. The long-range HIV genotyping from proviral DNA was successful in about 90% of 212 targeted blood specimens collected in a cohort where the majority of patients had suppressed viral loads, including 65% of patients with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA loads. The generated amplicons could be sequenced by different methods, such as population Sanger sequencing, single-genome sequencing, or next-generation ultradeep sequencing. The developed method is cost-effective-the cost of the long-range HIV genotyping is under $140 per subject (by Sanger sequencing)-and has the potential to enable the scale up of public health HIV prevention interventions.

The aim of the present study was to investigate differences in VD₃ mediated effects on rs1544410 genotyped dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MDM), key cells involved in HIV-1 infection. Immature DCs exhibited lower b-actin-normalized VDR mRNA expression in rs1544410_GG compared to cells with a rs1544410_AA genotype. VD₃ response on cell differentiation markers (CD14 inhibition and CD209 induction) was two-fold higher in rs1544410_AA (CD209, p=0.012; CD14, p=0.02). HIV-1-LTR reporter gene activity in MDM was boosted by VD₃; however, the effect was up to 50% higher in rs1544410_AA. We conclude that the rs1544410_AA association with progression to AIDS and resistance to HIV-1 appears to be linked to an enhanced response to VD₃."

Twenty-seven cases (26 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 1 Hodgkin's disease) were found, to give a cumulative incidence rate of 8% among Danish AIDS patients. Morphologically most NHL patients were classified into two groups: 1) high-grade tumors with a predominant population of immunoblasts, either monomorphic or more often polymorphic with plasmacytic differentiation; 2) Burkitt-type. Of 26 NHLs, 22 had a B-cell paraffin-section immunophenotype and 4 were non-B, non-T. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was demonstrated in tumor cells of 12 of 24 cases (50%) using in situ nucleic acid hybridization with a 35S-labeled probe in paraffin sections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was found in 65% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 tumors. This study suggests the existence of two main groups of AIDS-related lymphoma with different pathogeneses. First there are immunoblast-rich lesions, which usually are associated with EBV and morphologically resemble lymphomas described in immunosuppressed organ-transplantation patients. Second there are Burkitt-type tumors in which EBV sequences are less common and that may be pathogenetically analogous to sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma."

The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."

We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."

We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."

HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg.

Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."

One patient had fulminant hepatic failure and a second patient had subclinical hepatitis when lamivudine therapy was discontinued and a more efficacious antiretroviral regimen was substituted. Three patients had flares of hepatitis after 13 to 18 months of lamivudine therapy.

Among those with HCV genotype 1, asunaprevir plus daclatasvir was administered to 160 patients, sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir to 438 patients and paritaprevir plus ombitasvir and ritonavir to 25 patients. In total, 167 patients with genotype 2 were treated with SOF plus ribavirin. Three patients with an HBV DNA level ≥2000 IU/mL were treated with entecavir before anti-HCV therapy, without reactivation of HBV. In 3 of 22 (12%) HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients with an HBV DNA level <2000 IU/mL, the viral load increased during treatment. However, hepatitis flare did not occur in these patients. There was no significant difference in clinical history between patients with and without HBV reactivation. Among 765 patients with resolved HBV infection, HBV reactivation occurred in 1 (0.1%) patient after initial resolution, whose HBV DNA level spontaneously decreased after DAA therapy. We compared anti-HBs titres at baseline with those at post-DAA therapy in 123 patients without HBsAg. There was no significant difference in anti-HBs levels between the two points (P = .79). In conclusion, HBV reactivation was rare in HBsAg-negative patients treated with DAA therapy. Additionally, hepatitis did not occur in HBV-reactivated patients with a baseline HBV DNA level <2000 IU/mL before DAA therapy."

The standard HBV DNA hybridization assay used in phase II clinical studies has a low sensitivity, the detection limit of HBV DNA levels being approximately 10(7) genome equivalents per ml (geq ml-1). In this work we used a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (detection limit approximately 10(3) geq ml-1) to determine HBV DNA levels during a 24-week study of lamivudine in 51 stable chronic hepatitis B patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Patients were randomly allocated to receive oral doses of 25, 100 or 300 mg lamivudine once daily. At week 24 the median serum concentration of HBV DNA had fallen from 10(8) to 10(4) geq ml-1, a 4-log median reduction. A trend towards more profound suppression of viral replication with an increased dose of lamivudine was observed. After 12 weeks of therapy, 12% of patients had an HBV DNA level that was undetectable in the PCR assay; this increased to 26% after 24 weeks, while in an additional 20% of patients, HBV DNA decreased to the level of detection of the PCR assay. We conclude that a 24-week course of lamivudine decreases serum HBV DNA to the level of PCR detection in 46% of patients. Such additional viral suppressive activity with higher doses and more protracted lamivudine may be of clinical utility prior to liver transplantation. Further studies are needed to define the degree of virus suppression required in clinical practice, and methods are required to increase the efficacy of virus suppression."

Current treatments rarely cure chronic hepatitis B infection, highlighting the need for new anti-HBV drugs.

In chronically infected human patients, NAPs administration lead to a decline of blood HBsAg and HBV DNA and to HBsAg seroconversion, the expected signs of functional cure. NAPs have also been shown to prevent infection of duck hepatocytes with the Avihepadnavirus duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and to exert an antiviral activity against established DHBV infection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the specific anti-HBV antiviral activity of NAPs in the HepaRG human hepatoma cell line and primary cultures of human hepatocytes. NAPs with different chemical features (phosphorothioation, 2'O-methyl ribose, 5-methylcytidine) were assessed for antiviral activity when provided at the time of HBV inoculation or post-inoculation. NAPs dose-dependently inhibited HBV entry in a phosphorothioation-dependent, sequence-independent and size-dependent manner. This inhibition of HBV entry by NAPs was impaired by 2'O-methyl ribose modification. NAP treatment after viral inoculation did not elicit any antiviral activity."

HCV infection brings great threat to human health. Host genetic background could impact HCV infection, viral clearance, and treatment. Recently, some genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of HCV patients were performed. The results showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the IL28B gene, which encodes protein IFN-lambda3, are associated with viral clearance and treatment effectiveness of HCV patients who were cured by PEG-IFNalpha combined with ribavirin (RBV). IFN-lambda3 interacts with its acceptor, a heterodimer (IFN-lambdaR1 x IL-10R2), and upregulates the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGF). IFN-lambda3 plays roles in antiviral, antitumor, and immunoloregulation, and thus it might become a potential drug for Hepatitis C treatment. However, the mechanism of the IL28B gene in HCV infection and treatment is unclear, and further studies are needed to reveal the veils and provide theoretical basis for developing a new antiviral drug in clinic."
