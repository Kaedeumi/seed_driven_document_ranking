4048,0.015,15.0,"The government of Zimbabwe began providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in public institutions in 2004. In Midlands province two clinics constituted the most active HIV care service points, with patients being followed up through a comprehensive patient monitoring and tracking system which captured specific patient variables and outcomes over time. The data from 2006 to 2011 were subjected to analysis to answer specific research questions and this case study is based on that analysis. The goal of this case study is to build participants' capacity to undertake secondary data analysis and interpretation using a dataset for HIV antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe and to draw conclusions which inform recommendations. Case studies in applied epidemiology allow students to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. Case studies as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum are instrumental in reinforcing principles and skills covered in lectures or in background reading. The target audience includes Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs), university students, district health executives, and health information officers."
8438,0.014,14.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

5673,0.013,13.0,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
5402,0.012,12.0,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
4248,0.012,12.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) usually have an unfavorable clinical outcome in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
9923,0.012,12.0,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
4563,0.012,12.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
8267,0.012,12.0,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
6463,0.011,11.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
3236,0.011,11.0,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
6768,0.01,10.0,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
2359,0.01,10.0,"There is growing international concern that food insecurity may negatively impact antiretroviral (ARV) treatment outcomes, but no studies have directly evaluated the effect of food insecurity on viral load suppression and antiretroviral adherence. We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
355,0.01,10.0,"HIV increases the risk of liver disease as do two common coinfections, hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV). However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-naïve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ∼36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P = 0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P < 0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."
6369,0.01,10.0,"As of October 2006, 6 medications are approved in the United States for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: 2 formulations of interferon and 4 oral nucleos(t)ide analogues. For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
9178,0.01,10.0,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium among HIV/AIDS patients in southwest of Iran. Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
8417,0.01,10.0,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
6073,0.01,10.0,"Immune mechanisms that may control Cryptosporidium parvum infection remain unknown. The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."
1917,0.01,10.0,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
3712,0.009,9.0,"We describe five compliant patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis (TB) that relapsed, with acquisition of resistance by the original Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Both the first and second isolates from each patient had the same IS (insertion sequence) 6110-based DNA fingerprint patterns. Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients. We discuss several factors presumably associated with acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected patients, including exogenous reinfection, drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs, and the presence of a large organism burden."
2991,0.009,9.0,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
6581,0.009,9.0,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
9347,0.009,9.0,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
1796,0.009,9.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "
8772,0.009,9.0,"Individuals with serious mental illness are at higher risk for HIV than are members of the general population. Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."
5966,0.009,9.0,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."
8959,0.009,9.0,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
4831,0.009,9.0,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
4481,0.009,9.0,"Public safety and the right of the health care worker to practise without prejudice based on underlying illness may be at odds for those affected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Nevertheless, HBV does not preclude entry into a health care profession, and the risk of transmission from health care worker to patient is not uniform across the spectrum of health care fields. In the present article, the authors present an overview of the literature regarding transmission of HBV from the health care worker to the patient, and the current recommendations that vary from province to province within Canada. The establishment of national guidelines to standardize monitoring of HBV infection among health care workers would improve health care workplace safety and patient care."
3945,0.008,8.0,"The State of Amazonas in the Brazilian Amazon region is an area of high prevalence of hepatitis B and D virus (HBV and HDV) infection. The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."
80,0.008,8.0,"We estimated prevalence and incidence of liver condition outcomes, and costs to the health service of diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Tayside, UK. HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."
7773,0.008,8.0,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) poses a major diagnostic challenge in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
4890,0.008,8.0,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
2104,0.008,8.0,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

609,0.008,8.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic protozoa that have been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."
3108,0.008,8.0,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
2503,0.008,8.0,"Many oral lesions are strongly associated with HIV infection. Along with the HIV-infected individual's T helper cell count (CD4 + cell count), they indicate the severity of immune suppression. It is important for dental professionals to recognize these lesions early, as it alerts patients to their HIV status, and allows them to receive appropriate and prompt treatment for their HIV infection and related oral conditions. An atlas of the oral lesions commonly associated with HIV infection is presented. To update dental providers and assist them in the recognition and diagnosis of these conditions, the recent criteria for diagnosis suggested by the European Economic Community (EEC) Clearinghouse on Oral Problems Related to HIV Infection and the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre on Oral Manifestations of the Immunodeficiency virus are also presented."
7469,0.008,8.0,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."
6893,0.008,8.0,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
6426,0.008,8.0,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
2231,0.008,8.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."
9760,0.008,8.0,"The prevalence of serum markers of delta hepatitis was determined prospectively in 82 intravenous drug abusers at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). HDV antigen was detected in serum from one AIDS patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
5629,0.008,8.0,"Treatment with antiretroviral agents (ARVs) during pregnancy is important to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their use has been associated with low bone mineral density in adult patients. Currently, there are no data regarding the bone status of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate cortical bone status at delivery in a group of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy and to monitor the changes occurring during the first year postpartum. We studied 33 HIV-infected and 116 HIV-uninfected healthy Caucasian women within 4 days from delivery. Follow-up measurements were performed at 4 and 12 months postpartum in 17 HIV-infected and 55 healthy women. Cortical bone status was evaluated by quantitative ultrasonography at the mid-tibia, and bone measurements were expressed as the speed of sound (SOS). HIV-infected women after delivery had a median SOS of 3,985 (3,567-4,242) m/s, while the median SOS of healthy women was 4,025 (3,643-4,250) m/s. The difference was not significant (t = 0.39, P = 0.69). No significant differences were observed between ARV-exposed and control subjects at 4 and 12 months. Our data suggest that ARV during pregnancy and the first year after delivery does not affect negatively cortical bone status."

4806,0.008,8.0,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."
1718,0.008,8.0,"Nonadherence to combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapies (cART) is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

7643,0.008,8.0,"The objective of this study is to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge among patients with mental illness in Brazil and to examine individual and treatment setting predictors of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."
2192,0.008,8.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
5669,0.008,8.0,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."

There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection. The authors recommend that this infection should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, weight loss and dehydration in general and in diarrheal individuals with < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3)."
7294,0.008,8.0,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."
6727,0.008,8.0,"In the battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), focusing treatment on early intervention of its underlying condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, may help reduce the disability associated with AIDS. A comprehensive care hospital unit featuring physicians with expertise in HIV treatment, clinical research activities, and home health services may offer the most effective care for HIV patients. The preventive nature of comprehensive care also can reduce costs through decreased hospitalization, integrated hospital revenue centers, patients' minimized lost work time, and reduction of medical disability."
1150,0.008,8.0,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
9717,0.008,8.0,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
7248,0.008,8.0,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
2394,0.008,8.0,"Food insecurity is increasingly reported as an important barrier of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in both resource-poor and rich settings. However, unlike in resource rich-settings, very few quantitative studies to date have investigated the association of food insecurity with patient adherence to ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study examines the association between food insecurity and adherence to ART among HIV-infected adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
952,0.008,8.0,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."
3642,0.007,7.0,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
6234,0.007,7.0,"Despite the use of antiretroviral medications during the antenatal/perinatal period, 280 to 370 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants are born each year in the United States. Women who might transmit the virus to their infants are (1) those not offered antenatal testing due to perceived low risk; (2) those who are noncompliant with their antiretroviral regimen; (3) those with prophylaxis failures despite good compliance; and (4) those who present late to delivery without prenatal care. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention sponsored MIRIAD (mother-infant rapid intervention at delivery) to study rapid testing of women who present late in pregnancy and/or to labor and delivery with unknown HIV status. MIRIAD was implemented in 18 hospitals in 6 American cities. In Atlanta, GA, the 2 participating hospitals had institutional differences that created different models of implementation. Hospital 1 is large and publicly funded, practicing team nursing and utilizing laboratory-based testing. Hospital 2 is a medium-sized nonprofit, whose primary nursing model allowed for specially trained staff to do point-of-care (POC) testing. Regardless of hospital type, nursing care paradigms, or testing model, facilities interested in successfully implementing a similar protocol must formulate policies for testing, notification, and treatment as well as consider dedicating a staff member to the program."
6501,0.007,7.0,"Hepatitis B infection affects two billion people worldwide and 350 million of these are chronically infected. Chronic hepatitis B virus is one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. If it is left untreated, about one-third of affected people will develop progressive and possibly fatal liver disease, like hepatic cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, five nucleos(t)ide analogs are approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. They are: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In this work, we developed and validated an UPLC-Tandem mass spectrometry assay method capable of monitoring lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir plasma concentrations. Both standards and quality controls (high, medium and low) were prepared in human plasma. Each sample was added with internal standard (5'amino-5'deoxy-thymidine) and then drugs were extracted through a protein precipitation protocol with acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid and then dried. The extracts were resuspended in water and then injected into the chromatographic system. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm 2.1 × 150 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both added with formic acid (0.05%). Accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision at quality controls levels fitted all FDA guidelines for all analytes, while matrix effects and recoveries resulted stable between samples for each analyte. Finally, we tested this method by monitoring plasma concentrations in 30 HBV+ patients with good results. This simple analytical method could represent a useful tool for the management of anti-HBV therapy."
2468,0.007,7.0,"The dental health of 94 HIV-positive patients was investigated by the sum of carious, missing and filling teeth (DMF index), plaque (Silness and Löe) and bleeding point indices (Lenox and Kopczyk). Blood parameters were evaluated, including total lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, beta-2-microglobulin, platelets, the Quick index, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA). Patient oral parameters were contrasted with risk group (intravenous drug users homo- and heterosexuals) and controls. An evaluation was also made of differences in dental condition as a function of CD4+ cell number, according to the latest CDC classification (1992). HIV-positive intravenous drug users were found to present poorer DMF, plaque and bleeding point indices than the rest of the patients. No relationship was observed between CD4+ cell numbers in blood and dental condition, thus suggesting that the deteriorated dental health observed is a consequence of factors inherent to the risk groups involved rather than of the altered blood parameters."
1576,0.007,7.0,"Dentists in the Philippines were surveyed for evidence of past hepatitis A and B virus infections. Of the 234 dentists examined, 201 (85.9 per cent) were found to have been infected by HA virus and 137 (58.5 per cent) had been infected by HB virus. The proportion with evidence of past HB virus infection increased as the years in dental practice increased. This increment with age was not found in the general population of the Philippines. It is considered that the incremental pattern could be attributed to the summation of risk during many years of providing dental treatment. Comparing the proportion of dentists with HBV antibodies (anti-HBs/c) in the Philippines, Japan, USA and Denmark, the Philippine dentists were found to be more frequently infected than dentists in the other countries. However, the increment in the proportion positive for HBV as the years in practice advanced was consistent with that found in Japan. The prevalence of post HA virus infection in Philippine dentists was higher than the proportion for dentists in Japan but in both countries it is probable that dentists are infected at the same rate as the general population."
5770,0.007,7.0,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
2586,0.007,7.0,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
6550,0.007,7.0,Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects people worldwide but the local burden especially in pregnant women and their new born babies is unknown. In Rwanda HIV-infected individuals who are also infected with HBV are supposed to be initiated on ART immediately. HBV is easily transmitted from mother to child during delivery. We sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among pregnant women attending ante-natal clinic (ANC) in Rwanda and to determine factors associated with HBV and HIV co-infection.
9794,0.007,7.0,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
9162,0.007,7.0,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
3845,0.007,7.0,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
2071,0.007,7.0,"To assess the association between support group membership, socio-demographic and HIV related factors including knowledge and attitude of illness in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."
5243,0.007,7.0,"In Waorani communities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador, hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen was found in 14% of asymptomatic persons. The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
3781,0.007,7.0,"Poor adherence remains a major barrier to achieving the clinical and public health benefits of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conduct to evaluate how ARV adverse drug reactions may influence ARV adherence. Thirty-nine articles were identified, and 33 reported that ARV adverse drug reactions decreased adherence and six studies found no influence. Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence. Informing HIV-infected individuals about ARV adverse drug reactions prior to initiation, counselling about coping mechanisms, and experiencing the effectiveness of ARVs on wellbeing may improve ARV adherence."
4564,0.007,7.0,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
7450,0.007,7.0,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
8318,0.007,7.0,"The relevance of CD4+T-cells, viral load and age in the immunological response to influenza infection and vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals has previously been pointed out. Our study aimed at assessing, in the setting of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination, whether quantification of activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression in blood B-cells may provide additional indications for predicting antibody response to vaccination in HIV-1 infected patients with similar CD4+T-cell counts and age. Forty-seven healthy controls, 37 ART-treated and 17 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months after vaccination. Antibody titers to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay while the mRNA expression levels of AID were measured by quantitative real time PCR. Upon B-cell activation in vitro, AID increase correlated to antibody response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 1 month after vaccination in all individuals. In addition, the maximum expression levels of AID were significantly higher in those individuals who still carried protective levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies after 6 months from vaccination. No correlation was found between CD4+T-cell counts or age at vaccination or HIV-1 viral load and levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Assessing AID expression before vaccination may be an additional useful tool for defining a vaccination strategy in immune-compromised individuals at risk of immunization failure."
3505,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
4018,0.007,7.0,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
3951,0.007,7.0,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
8668,0.007,7.0,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
7542,0.007,7.0,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an important public health issue, because it may affect the outcome of antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
1495,0.007,7.0,"Minimizing death and ensuring high retention and good adherence remain ongoing challenges for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment programs. We examined whether the addition of community-based accompaniment (characterized by daily home visits from a community health worker, directly observed treatment, nutritional support, transportation stipends, and other support as needed) to the Rwanda national model for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery would improve retention in care, viral load suppression, and change in CD4 count, relative to the national model alone."
4293,0.007,7.0,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."

This study investigated the impact of this funding policy on the society and health care system."
1939,0.007,7.0,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
8433,0.007,7.0,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."
1710,0.007,7.0,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
242,0.007,7.0,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
5380,0.007,7.0,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
8094,0.007,7.0,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."
2679,0.007,7.0,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."
1691,0.007,7.0,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
2628,0.007,7.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "
5876,0.007,7.0,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
4821,0.007,7.0,"Evaluation of resistance pattern in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Retrospective study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance mutations in patients found viraemic after first-line treatment. HBV viral load was determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and the substitutions in HBV-DNA were studied by polymerase sequencing test. First line treatment had failed in 12 out of 33 patients (36%) receiving anti-HBV drugs. The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg. The use of potent drugs in the first line anti-HBV therapy may reduce the resistance mutations in the future."
9700,0.007,7.0,"An assay, specifically optimized to evaluate the anti-HIV activity of antiretrovirals by flow cytometry analysis, is described. As widely used anti-HIV agents, zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV), and as drugs of recent approval raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV), were utilized as reference drugs. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus was prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with purified plasmid DNA and quantified by p24 antigen-capture assay. For infection, CEM-GFP cells were exposed to vehicle or to several concentrations of the drugs for 2 hr at 37 °C before HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to each sample. The adsorption was prolonged for 3 hr at 37 °C. After 72 hr of incubation, HIV-induced GFP expression in infected CEM-GFP cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and expressed as % positive cells. For comparison, p24 production in supernatants was assessed by a commercial ELISA kit. On the basis of IC50 values, the anti-HIV activity, as assayed by this method, was EFV > 3TC > AZT > NVP > DDI > ABC and ETR > RPV > RAL. The comparison between the IC50 values calculated through flow cytometry and p24 production revealed overlapping results, showing that the optimized protocol of CEM-GFP infection with HIV NL4-3 is a suitable method to perform quantitative, rapid and low-expensive screening tests to evaluate the in vitro effect of new candidate anti-HIV drugs."
6626,0.007,7.0,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two-gene locus cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 and CD86 +1057 were previously reported to influence the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) with respect to allograft acceptance. SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
2495,0.007,7.0,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
4360,0.007,7.0,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."
9755,0.007,7.0,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."
3241,0.007,7.0,"The resuscitation of a trauma patient is a very hectic and seemingly chaotic situation. The nature of the situation increases the likelihood that a health care worker will receive an accidental needle stick while caring for the patient. There is also a common belief that there is a higher prevalence of communicable bloodborne diseases in the trauma population, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the greatest amount of fear. This belief of higher prevalence communicable diseases in the trauma population is supported by the literature. We sent blood from our Code One (life-threatening) trauma population for analysis for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies. We found that 0.52% of our trauma population had HIV. We also found that 1.5 per cent had hepatitis B surface antigen, and 13.8 per cent had hepatitis C antibodies. Our prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B is similar to that found in other studies of the trauma populations and higher than the general population. Our hepatitis C prevalence is surprising, considering the very low reported prevalence in the general population. Hepatitis C may be a more significant threat to the health of medical personnel than previously believed."
4117,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates of 8 Ethiopian and 8 Swedish untreated AIDS-patients were examined for their sensitivity to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and leukocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate. This isolate exhibited a mutation at amino acid position 215. These results suggest that it should be possible to perform clinical trials in Ethiopia using the same dose regimens as in Sweden."
7695,0.007,7.0,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of food insecurity on HIV disease outcomes in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.
8908,0.007,7.0,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

9746,0.007,7.0,"When faced with the ever-increasing demand for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), as well as a variety of fungal, parasitic, and bacterial opportunistic infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, the Chest Service and the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital developed a coordinated plan for the collection and rapid examination of specimens to allow presumptive diagnoses to be made as quickly as possible. Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms."
2946,0.007,7.0,"Vitamin D plays role in bone health and the regulation of the immune system. A cross-sectional study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels was conducted among HIV-1-infected Thai patients to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vitamin D levels (25[OH]D <30 ng/mL) in tropical setting. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Of 178 patients, 58% received antiretroviral therapy at median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 7.4 (5.9-8.5) years. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-29.9 ng/mL) was 26.8% and 44.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving efavirenz (EFV) was significantly associated with low vitamin D status (odds ratio = 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-12.15, P <.05). The mean (±standard deviation) level of 25(OH)D in patients receiving and not receiving EFV was 22.9 (6.6) and 28.6 (10.7) ng/mL, respectively, (P <.05). Low vitamin D status is common and needs to be assessed among HIV-infected patients including tropical residents especially when EFV is used."
8189,0.007,7.0,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
8594,0.007,7.0,"The U.S. military represents a unique population within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."
596,0.007,7.0,"Little information exists on the frequency, severity, and timing of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug-related adverse events (TB-AEs) in HIV-tuberculosis coinfected (HIV-TB) patients in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients."
1912,0.006,6.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
6947,0.006,6.0,"The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."
720,0.006,6.0,"The scarcity of liver donors requires consideration of grafts from sources not previously used. Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."

A cure for the fully developed AIDS related to HIV infection remains elusive, and HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Life expectancy, however, has gradually increased over the years, resulting in a concern for a potential increase in the incidence of secondary psychiatric manifestations. Knowledge of the neuropathology of HIV-CNS dysfunction and familiarity with its clinical presentation can aid clinicians in a determination of the appropriate therapy inclusive of psychiatric care that may be useful for a specific individual in their treatment."

The objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with interest in an app to self-manage drinking and to identify differences in baseline mobile technology use among PLWH by drinking level."
7024,0.006,6.0,"Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic DNA from oral isolates of four different Candida species other than C. albicans and atypical chlamydospore-positive isolates from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and AIDS patients was investigated as a means for differentiating between isolates within individual species. Oligonucleotides composed of simple repetitive sequence motifs, including (GACA)4, (GATA)4, (GGAT)4, (GTG)5, and (GT)8, all yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation of 8 C. tropicalis isolates, 12 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata isolates, 8 atypical Candida isolates, and, except for (GATA)4, 2 C. krusei probe in turn and so generate several distinct DNA fingerprints of the same DNA sample. However, none of the probes yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation with three C. parapsilosis isolates. The (GATA)4 probe was also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms among a genetically closely related group of atypical Candida isolates on primary isolation from an additional HIV-infected patient. These chlamydospore-positive atypical Candida isolates were sucrose positive, were of C. albicans serotype A, hybridized weakly with the C. albicans-specific mid-repeat sequence probe 27A, and yielded fingerprint profiles by random polymorphic DNA analysis that were distinct from those derived from C. albicans isolates. The C. stellatoidea ex-type strain NCPF 3108 was indistinguishable from the atypical Candida isolates in all these tests and also yielded an identical carbohydrate and nitrogen source assimilation profile by using the ID 32C yeast identification system."
6928,0.006,6.0,"The authors examined sexual behaviors, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and condom use among 2,314 homosexual and bisexual men tested during 1988-1989 at the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) National Center in Mexico City. Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."
8709,0.006,6.0,"The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HIV infection among specific population subgroups and complement the HIV surveillance system in Cameroon. Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
3595,0.006,6.0,"The results of a study of screening recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by family physicians are reported. Of 209 family practice residents and clinical faculty from the four UCLA-affiliated family practice residency programs surveyed, 110 (53%) responded. Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended."
7981,0.006,6.0,"We examined attitudinal and demographic correlates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems."
4852,0.006,6.0,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."

3490,0.006,6.0,"Viral quasispecies analysis is important for basic and clinical research. This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047× and 687× in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

5074,0.006,6.0,"HIV-1 resistance mutations to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTI; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTI; and protease inhibitors, PI) represent a challenge for sustainable virologic and immunologic responses. HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
5427,0.006,6.0,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens have recently been used in HIV-1 infected children in resource-limited settings. Treatment failure with this regimen has become more common. A second regimen needs to be prepared for the Thai national program. Genotypic resistance testing was conducted among HIV-1 infected children who experienced virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) using NNRTI-based regimens. Patterns of resistance mutations were studied and options for a second regimen were determined. There were 21 patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.1 (1.9-7.7) years. Sixteen patients were males. The median CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA at the time of virological failure were 647 cells/mm3 and 5.3 log copies/ml, respectively. The prevalences of patients with > or =1 major mutation conferring resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were 52% and 43%, respectively. Thymidine analoque mutations, M184V/I, and Q151M were observed in 38%, 33%, and 5%. The patterns of resistance mutations suggest that 48% of patients need a protease inhibitor-based regimen for the second regimen and didanosine+lamivudine is the most required nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone."
1795,0.006,6.0,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
2462,0.006,6.0,"Six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-1/2 immunoassays, including five enzyme immunoassays and one rapid test, were challenged with up to 250 serum samples collected from various global sites. The serum samples were from individuals known to be infected with variants of HIV-1 including group M subtypes A, B, B', C, D, E, F, and G and group O. All immunoassays detected the vast majority of samples tested. Three samples produced low signal over cutoff values in one or more tests: a clade B sample, an untypeable sample with a low antibody titer, and a group O sample. It is concluded that HIV-1 immunoassays used in the United States are capable of detecting most HIV-1 group M variants."
921,0.006,6.0,"Cellular responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are impaired in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients showing uncontrolled viral replication and immune suppression. Very few studies have explored to what extent HCV-specific response improves as a consequence of control of HIV replication by highly active antiretroviral therapy. We compared HCV-specific T-cell responses between HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, showing complete viral suppression, and HCV-monoinfected patients."
4941,0.006,6.0,"Outcomes of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are varied, with increased morbidity reported in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. The factors driving different outcomes are not well understood, but there is increasing interest in an HLA class I effect. We therefore studied the influence of HLA class I on HBV in an African HIV-positive cohort. We demonstrated that virologic markers of HBV disease activity (hepatitis B e antigen status or HBV DNA level) are associated with HLA-A genotype. This finding supports the role of the CD8(+) T-cell response in HBV control, and potentially informs future therapeutic T-cell vaccine strategies. "
1962,0.006,6.0,"Several infectious agents have been associated with development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Among these is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which infects more than 200 million people worldwide. HCV infection has been linked to progression of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) syndrome and has also been suggested to contribute to development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Mechanisms responsible for development of lymphoproliferative disorders among HCV-positive patients remain unclear. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which chronic stimulation of B-cells by antigens associated with HCV infection causes nonmalignant B-cell expansion that may evolve into B-cell NHL. The course of disease among HCV-positive B-cell NHL patients may be complicated by coinfection with other infectious agents. This possibility has been explored by studies that have investigated potential interactions between HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as between HCV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Further characterization of the mechanisms by which HCV promotes development of lymphoproliferative disorders may improve diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these conditions."
1165,0.006,6.0,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
3377,0.006,6.0,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
8178,0.006,6.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as an important cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."
7356,0.006,6.0,"The characteristics of intra-host human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env evolution were evaluated in untreated HIV-1-infected subjects with different patterns of disease progression, including 2 normal progressor [NP], and 5 Long term non-progressor [LTNP] patients. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."
1910,0.006,6.0,"Few empirical studies have evaluated the mediating effects of quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
4794,0.006,6.0,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
255,0.006,6.0,"A patient with HIV infection developed the first episode of AIDS-defining opportunism (severe Candida albicans esophagitis) with an underlying CD4+ lymphocyte count of 1,025 cells/microL. After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."
896,0.006,6.0,"In February and in June 1998, two people developed acute hepatitis B following in-patient care in a district general hospital. Initial enquiries indicated their infections were not attributable to staff undertaking exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). We report the findings and implications of the subsequent investigation: a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency investigation, including molecular epidemiological analysis. Occupational Health records showed that staff involved in EPPs with the patients were HBsAg negative. No contact between the patients was identified nor were there failures in sterilization. The patients' HBV strains were identical, indicating a common source. A total of 231 out of 232 staff who might have treated either patient were tested for HBsAg; the remaining doctor, working abroad, was HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive and had the same HBV strain as the patients. On two occasions the doctor's hand had been cut while breaking glass vials, but there was no documentation linking these events to the two patients. The doctor had been vaccinated in 1993 and tested for anti-HBs prior to commencing work in 1997. The doctor was recalled to Occupational Health but did not attend and was not followed up. In total, 4948 patients potentially treated by the doctor received an explanatory letter and 3150 were tested for HBsAg. Only one was positive, and HBV sequencing showed no link to the doctor. Occasionally transmission of HBV from heath-care workers can occur in a non-EPP setting and the implications of this require examination by those setting national policy. Occupational Health Services should investigate clinical heath-care workers who do not respond to vaccination. They should ensure HBV carriers are identified and offer them appropriate advice to prevent transmission to patients."
2510,0.006,6.0,"HIV-2 infection is confined mostly to West Africa. Seven HIV-2 subtypes have so far been described; only HIV-2 subtypes A and B are prevalent, the others being considered self-limiting infections at the epidemiological level. The main limitation for the HIV-2 DNA proviral quantification is the lack of HIV-2 DNA standard. We designed and tested a new HIV-2 primer couple that amplifies both the HIV-2 ROD strain and HIV-1 LAV/BRU strain. These HIV-2 primers were used to quantified an HIV-2 standard comparatively to a standard widely used in proviral DNA HIV-1 quantification, i.e., the 8E5 cell line transfected by a single defective integrated provirus of HIV-1 BRU/LAV by cell. The primers and probe used to quantify HIV-2 DNA are located in a long terminal repeat (LTR) region with low variability. These primers amplify both HIV-2 subtypes A and B. The relevance of the follow-up of the infected patients by the quantification of the proviral DNA HIV-2 is currently studied."
8861,0.006,6.0,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."
6098,0.006,6.0,"We carried out a cross-sectional survey in Shiraz to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1 444 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We also determined the risk factors for this coinfection. Demographic and behavioural data were obtained using a standard questionnaire. The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 78.4% (95% CI: 76.3-80.5). Intravenous drug use (OR = 7.2; 95% CI: 4.9-10.6), imprisonment (OR = 6.9; 95% CI: 4.6-10.4), tattooing in prison (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), tattooing out of prison (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and age (OR = 1.02 with increasing each year of life; 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) were significantly associated with HCV-HIV coinfection. Prevalence of HCV-HIV coinfection is high in Shiraz. Intravenous drug use and imprisonment are the main risk factors for this coinfection. Therefore, serious implementation of HIV and HCV testing, education, prevention, care and treatment programmes and evaluation of harm reduction programmes in prisons are very important."
4476,0.006,6.0,"Retroviral genomes with a high frequency of G-->A mutations are thought to originate during reverse transcription (RT). Here we present a case report of an AIDS patient infected with a subtype F variant where extensive G-->A hypermutation (G-->A Hypm) sequences were found in the protease gene. This patient was failing HAART at the time the hypermutation was found. These sequences were basically encountered in the proviral compartment on two occasions and were persistently absent in the plasma viral population. The patient's viral genotype showed several mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance in RT (T69N, M184V, T215F, K219Q) and protease (M36I, G48V, I54V, T63L, V82A) genes. The drug regimen was changed and the viral load dropped 0.9 Logs and CD4 count increased by 200 cells/ml. The hypermutation was not found any more in a 1-year follow up. The patient's wife was infected with a similar virus strain and G-->A Hypm sequences were also detected in the RT gene. This is the first report of sexual transmitted G-->A Hypermutation in HIV-1 and suggest that this phenomenon can be genetically coded by the viral RT molecule."

3307,0.006,6.0,"During the last 5 years, considerable scientific and financial efforts have been made in the development of quantitative nucleic acid detection technology. For detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), quantitative culture is time consuming, cumbersome and requires appropriate laboratory safety equipment. Quantitative determination of p24 antigen by enzyme immunoassay is of limited value due to its relatively poor sensitivity. Therefore, quantitative determination of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques is the most accurate, prognostic marker for HIV type 1 infection, independently of the CD4+ cell count. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not cultivable in vitro. Serological assays allow an accurate diagnosis and follow-up of acute or chronic infection. Quantification of HBV DNA is used for the monitoring of antiviral therapy, determination of infectivity and for resolution of unclear serological profiles, e.g. isolated anti-HBc reactivity, as well as for patients in which HBV mutants are suspected. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be detected by molecular based assays because no cell culture system, which permits a reliable isolation of clinical specimens, is currently available. Furthermore, early diagnosis and follow-up of infection cannot be achieved with antibody serology. The prognostic relevance of quantitative HCV RNA determination is of limited value for the long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis C. However, viral load may predict the outcome of antiviral therapy. Genetic diversity is another challenge for HCV RNA quantification."
9090,0.006,6.0,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
5432,0.006,6.0,"Clinical observation shows pregnant women under antiretroviral therapy present bleeding episodes at delivery, although this therapy promotes a decrease in fibrinolysis in nonpregnant patients, suggesting a prothrombotic state in the former. Since these drugs provoke hepatic disorders, they can cause bleeding disturbances. We investigated effects of antiretroviral therapy on hemostasis in pregnant women. Two groups were studied: pregnant women with HIV (n = 11), and (control) pregnant women without HIV (n = 7). Four blood samples were collected from each individual in both groups: one at the beginning of pregnancy before treatment, two during pregnancy and therapy, and one 6 weeks after delivery. Treatment was performed according to recommendations of the Brazilian Health Department for the evaluation of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, factors VII, X, and XII, fibrinogen concentration, protein C, protein S, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrin degradation products (FbDPs). Statistical analysis demonstrated pregnancy caused increased factor VII (P = 0.0313), factor X (P = 0.0156) and factor XII (P = 0.0156) activity, fibrinogen concentration (P = 0.0156), t-PA (P = 0.0313), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P = 0.0156) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0313). HIV infection caused increased factor XII (P = 0.0114), t-PA (P = 0.0346) and FbDPs (P = 0.0003), and decreased protein S levels (P = 0.0441). Antiretroviral therapy reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.0114) and protein S (P = 0.0012), and increased t-PA (P = 0. 0204) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0154). The results suggest a prothrombic state developing during pregnancy, maintenance of hemostatic equilibrium in HIV infection and occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis, not due to hepatotoxicity, during antiretroviral therapy, causing the clinically observed bleeding episodes."
4844,0.006,6.0,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
4789,0.006,6.0,"Two very rare case reports of bladder transitional cell carcinoma associated with HIV infection in patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy are described, and discussed on the ground of the most relevant and updated literature resources. Only 13 cases of vesical carcinoma have been reported to date in the setting of HIV infection, but only 3 anecdotal single reports (the last in the y 2001) described clinical, therapeutic, and outcome issues of this rare disease association in some detail. In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient. No relationship was found with the very favourable underlying HIV-related virological and immunological status, and the present 8-12-month follow-up did not show disease relapses."
6193,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may either emerge in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as a result of positive selection pressure exerted by their own immune response, or during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Naturally occurring HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance are rarely observed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the (eventual) circulation of HBV variants with natural resistance to NAs currently used as therapy for CHB in Argentina. This study reports 13 cases of CHB-infected patients with natural antiviral resistance to at least one NA. Five of them were also carriers of S-variants that might escape the humoral immune system recognition with potential resistance to adefovir. In addition to the already reported A2 HBV subgenotype association to NAs natural resistance, E and F genotypes association to such resistance is described for the first time. These findings suggest that sequence analysis of the HBV reverse transcriptase might be an essential tool before starting antiviral therapy, in order to choose the proper NAs for optimizing the therapeutic management of chronically infected patients. Moreover, the circulation and transmission of S-mutants with resistance to such antiviral drugs should be of public health concern as they may represent an additional risk for the community."
9895,0.006,6.0,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."
5087,0.006,6.0,"Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5413,0.006,6.0,The increasing impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the health care delivery system requires surveillance of current patterns of HIV-related health care utilization to adequately plan for future needs.

1408,0.006,6.0,"RNA virus population dynamics are complex, and sophisticated approaches are needed in many cases for therapeutic intervention. One such approach, termed lethal mutagenesis, is directed at targeting the virus population structure for extinction or error catastrophe. Previous studies have demonstrated the concept of this approach with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by use of chemical mutagens [i.e., 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)] as well as by host factors with mutagenic properties (i.e., APOBEC3G). In this study, these two unrelated mutagenic agents were used concomitantly to investigate the interplay of these distinct mutagenic mechanisms. Specifically, an HIV-1 was produced from APOBEC3G (A3G)-expressing cells and used to infect permissive target cells treated with 5-AZC. Reduced viral infectivity and increased viral mutagenesis were observed with both the viral mutagen (i.e., G-to-C mutations) and the host restriction factor (i.e., G-to-A mutations); however, when combined, they had complex interactions. Intriguingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that concomitant HIV-1 exposure to both 5-AZC and A3G resulted in an increase in G-to-A viral mutagenesis at the expense of G-to-C mutagenesis. A3G catalytic activity was required for the diminution in G-to-C mutagenesis. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration for potentiation of the mutagenic effect of a cytosine analog by A3G expression, resulting in concomitant HIV-1 lethal mutagenesis."
2549,0.006,6.0,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and risk factors associated to it. Three hundred sixty-one HBsAg chronic carriers from southern Italy were studied and 13.8% of them resulted anti-delta positive. 80% of these subjects were less than 50 years old. When anti-delta positive subjects were compared with anti-delta negative ones, a lower number of healthy HDV carriers and a higher frequency of cirrhotics were noted among anti-delta positive. Of lower than 50 years, imprisonment, sexual contacts with drug abusers and male homosexuality were risk factors of HDV infection. No association was found with sex, household contacts with HBV or HDV carriers, number of family members and transfusion of blood products. These data confirm the high prevalence of HDV infection in southern Italy."
1020,0.006,6.0,"In addition to development or selection of resistance, failure to continuously suppress HIV-1 production while still using initially effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may result from super-infection with a drug-resistant strain. Both transmission of drug resistant HIV and super-infection have been demonstrated. We analysed HIV pol genes obtained before start of initially successful cART and during failure while still on cART in 101 patients. Difference in precART and cART failure sequences were explained by evolution and not by super-infection."
9396,0.006,6.0,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
6042,0.006,6.0,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
6181,0.006,6.0,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
3793,0.006,6.0,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
9188,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
9487,0.006,6.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
5434,0.006,6.0,"Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was used to characterize the precore region of HBV from Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis. Two types of mutually exclusive variants were found in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients. The first (M1) contains a substitution from proline to serine at codon 15. A second group were infected with a previously described mutant (M2) containing a translational stop codon. HBeAg-positive patients were infected with the wild-type virus or the M1-containing strain. M2 emerged in patients with wild-type infection after seroconversion to anti-HBe, whereas M1 was present during the HBeAg-positive phase. In those with fluctuating HBe status, there was no correlation between prevailing HBe serology and sequence. There was an association between infection with variants and severe chronic hepatitis. Patients infected with strains containing M1 while HBeAg positive had a worse prognosis after seroconversion to anti-HBe."

4623,0.006,6.0,"Wasting remains a significant condition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite antiretroviral treatment. Early identification requires the measurement of various body composition parameters, particularly body cell mass (BCM). Anthropometry may provide some useful information. Cost and complexity issues make many body composition techniques unsuitable for the clinical setting. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be the best method available to caregivers for monitoring serial changes in BCM over time and for determining the occurrence of wasting. It is not useful, however, for detecting body composition changes in patients with fat redistribution syndromes. Portability, low cost, ease of use, and patient acceptance make anthropometry and BIA ideally suited for the clinical setting."
5566,0.006,6.0,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
5890,0.006,6.0,"We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy."
7023,0.006,6.0,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."
1433,0.006,6.0,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a possible treatment for acute or chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reinfection of the graft can be a serious complication. The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
2450,0.006,6.0,"The risk for dental hygienists to contract HIV and hepatitis B infection at work was studied in an international cohort of 167 dental hygienists from 13 countries. A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
398,0.006,6.0,"Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their relationship with health-care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV care in the southeastern US (n=526). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%) reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%) of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication adherence (p=0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits (including Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006) and a support group (p=0.040) were associated with being less likely to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health-related counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p=0.003). Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance of interventions to address these needs."
3943,0.006,6.0,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."
9306,0.006,6.0,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."

7308,0.006,6.0,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."

Pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccination and the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure to blood are the most effective strategies for preventing DHCP from occupational infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. Each dental health care facility should develop a comprehensive written program for preventing and managing occupational exposures to blood that: (1) describes the types of blood exposures that may place DHCP at risk for infection; (2) outlines procedures for promptly reporting and evaluating such exposures; and (3) identifies a health care professional who is qualified to provide counseling and perform all medical evaluations and procedures in accordance with the most current USPHS recommendations. Finally, resources should be available that permit rapid access to clinical care, testing, counseling, and PEP for exposed DHCP and the testing and counseling of source patients."

The study objective was to evaluate the quality of laboratory performance in testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody. After identifying relevant variables in univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed using stepwise logistic models. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody test performance was independently associated with analytic variables such as commercial test kit used and with nonanalytic variables such as experience, training, and degree requirements of laboratory personnel. These results validate the importance of nonanalytic variables to the quality of outcomes in laboratory testing."
4611,0.006,6.0,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."
1679,0.006,6.0,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."
6467,0.006,6.0,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate HIV seroprevalence among infectious (smear positive) cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and to describe the relation between antituberculosis drug resistance and infection with human immunodeficiency virus. A total of 418 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who attended the out patient departments of Harar Tuberculosis Centre and two general hospitals were studied from October 1994 through January 1995. The majority (94%) of these patients were from the tuberculosis centre. Sputum cultures were positive for 338/418 (80.9%) patients. HIV seroprevalence was 92/418 (22.0%) among smear positive and 69/338 (20.4%) among culture positive patients. HIV positive patients were more likely to be from urban than rural areas (p < 0.001). Initial resistance was not affected by HIV seropositivity. Secondary drug resistance was significantly higher in HIV positive patients than HIV negatives (p < 0.05). Although not significant, HIV positive patients were more defaulters than HIV negatives. Significantly higher numbers of HIV positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were cases of relapse and treatment failure (p < 0.05). Other studies are required in order to assess the impact of HIV infection on the spread of anti-tuberculosis resistance. Supervised and appropriate treatments with follow up are required in order to minimise the spread of drug resistant tubercle bacilli among HIV infected patients."

Three out of 63 studied samples (4.8%) were positive in a qualitative test for total antibodies to HDV antigen. Five samples (7.9%) turned out to be HDV-RNA-positive by RT-PCR, four of them were sequenced in the region of L-HDAg, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All four examined samples belonged to genotype I. Two RNA-positive/anti-HD-negative samples possessed a few uncommon nucleotide substitution sites within the L-HDAg sequence, which could suggest unique variants in the Polish population of HDV-infected patients."

Similar to previous reports of hyperthyroidism due to IRD, all of our patients experienced a rapid early recovery in total CD4 count, but developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism on average 3 years (38 months) after beginning cART, which represents a longer time frame than previously reported. Awareness and recognition of this potential complication of cART, which may occur years after treatment initiation, will allow patients with immune restorative hyperthyroidism to receive timely therapy and avoid the long-term complications associated with undiagnosed thyroid disease."
2286,0.006,6.0,"The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, is an important immunoregulatory hormone [1]. Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor, which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes. Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B virus. Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 (genotype tt) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis (chi2=6.22, 1 df, P=. 01) and persistent hepatitis B infection (chi2=6.25, 1 df, P=.01) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes. Therefore, this genetic variant, which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations, may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases."

Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least three of five clinical or radiologic criteria.

4892,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk of surgeons especially in developing countries where asymptomatic carrier rate is about 15%. Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
8678,0.006,6.0,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population. The role of flow cytometry in monitoring patients with HIV infection is discussed."
6815,0.006,6.0,"This study aims to determine the relationship among cerebral metabolite concentrations (on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy or (1)H MRS), cognitive function, and clinical variables (CD4, plasma and CSF viral loads, and lipids) in antiretroviral medication-nai;ve HIV patients. We hypothesized that the probable glial markers myo-inositol [MI] and choline compounds [CHO] would correlate with cognitive function, CD4 count, and viral loads, but not with serum lipids. Forty-five antiretroviral-drug-nai;ve HIV patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated. Frontal lobe [MI], [CHO], and total creatine [CR] were elevated, while basal ganglia [CR] were decreased, with increasing dementia severity. As a group, HIV patients showed slowing on fine motor (Grooved Pegboard) and psychomotor function (Trails A & B), and deficits on executive function (Stroop tasks). Lower CD4 counts and elevated plasma viral loads were associated with elevated frontal white matter [MI], which in turn correlated with the Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that systemic factors (resulting from suppressed immune function and higher plasma viral load) may lead to glial proliferation (elevated [MI], [CHO], and [CR]) in the frontal white matter, which in turn may contribute to deficits on executive function in HIV. Studying antiretroviral-nai;ve patients minimized the confounding effects of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical, MRS, and neuropsychological variables, and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the relationships among these measurements. Metabolite concentrations, rather than metabolite ratios, should be measured since [CR], a commonly used reference for metabolite ratios, varies with disease severity in both frontal lobe and basal ganglia."

The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."

Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
9567,0.005,5.0,"2346 liver samples from 17 areas in China were investigated for intrahepatic hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) by direct enzyme-labelled technique. HDAg was detected in 167 out of 1764 samples of HBsAg positive individuals with the detection rate of 9.47%. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection existed in all the examined areas without any significant difference regarding HDAg detection rate. A relationship of intrahepatic HDAg to the pathologic type of the liver disease was observed. The HDAg detection rate in chronic liver diseases and severe hepatitis was higher than in other liver diseases. It suggested that HDV infection was associated with the progression and chronicity of the liver disease. Studies on the relationship between HDV infection and HBV replication showed that HBV replication might be suppressed by HDV infection. Both HDV and HBV, however, could replicate in the same hepatocyte simultaneously."
5760,0.005,5.0,"Several of the common viral agents that can cause hepatitis have been detected in body fluids, including saliva and blood, which may both form important routes for transmission of disease. The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections. The potential hazards are discussed in relation to those associated with HBV and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), implicated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
2722,0.005,5.0,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
636,0.005,5.0,"Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy and in the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections, oncological and consequent hematologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continue to occur and are of significant clinical importance. Virus-related tumors (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, induced by human herpesvirus 8; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Epstein-Barr virus; and anogenital tumors, linked to human papillomavirus) are frequent in patients with HIV-induced immune deficiency. The incidence of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has declined among homosexual men, but this tumor remains problematic in many patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is 60 times more prevalent in HIV-positive persons than in others and typically presents as advanced-stage, high- or intermediate-grade B cell lymphoma, with frequent extranodal involvement. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is also common. Cervical carcinoma in HIV-positive women is also usually advanced at diagnosis. Anal carcinoma is increasing in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. Chemotherapy for these tumors can result in dose-limiting cytopenia that can be well-controlled with hematopoietic growth factors, allowing patients to avoid transfusions and maintain the dose intensity of their chemotherapy regimens."
5894,0.005,5.0,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."

A convenience sample of 287 clients (220 men and 67 women) was given a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Overall, complementary therapy use was 31%. Patients who used complementary therapy were more likely to be white (O.R., 2.5), female (O.R. 3.3), a high school graduate (O.R. 2.9), and to know another complementary therapy user (O.R. 7.8). Age, sexual orientation, CD4 cell count, injection drug use, living with another HIV-infected person, having pain, and HIV support group membership were not associated. Men were more likely than women, and whites were more likely than nonwhites, to use vitamins/minerals, imagery/meditation, and dietary regimens. Nonwhites were more likely than whites, and women more likely than men, to use spiritual healing. Of those using complementary therapy, men were more likely than women, and whites more likely than nonwhites, to get information about complementary therapy from HIV organizations, friends, and homosexual-oriented media. Doctors and nurses were the most frequently cited source of complementary therapy information for women. Frequency, type of therapies used, and source of information about complementary therapy among HIV-infected persons vary by race and gender. Clinicians should be educated about complementary therapies so that they can provide information to their patients and be aware of self-treatment behavior."
3966,0.005,5.0,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
7973,0.005,5.0,"Drug resistance is an increasing problem in the treatment of HIV infection. Tenofovir has been shown to inhibit HIV replication even with thymidine-associated resistance mutations (TAMs) if they are limited to two or less. Double-dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (600 mg QD) was used to determine weather the drug could be virologically effective in patients harbouring HIV-strains resistant to nucleoside analogues (NRTI). A pilot, open, non-comparative add-on study, where patients failing a current antiretroviral regimen, with at least two TAMs, and naive for tenofovir, were given tenofovir 600 mg once-daily for 4 weeks, in addition to their current failing antiretroviral regimen. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients with plasma viral load (VL) reduction of at least 0.8 log(10) between baseline and week 4 (W4). Ten patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median viral load was 3.66 log(10) copies/ml (range 3.13-4.03) and the median CD4 cell count was 407/mm(3) (range 136-1102). The percentage of patients with reduction the viral load > or =0.8 log(10) was 40% at W4. After 4 weeks of treatment with tenofovir 600 mg, the median decrease in the viral load was -0.61 log(10) (range -0.05; -0.88) and the median gain of CD4 was +109/mm(3). Despite a twofold increase tenofovir plasma concentrations, no serious drug-related adverse event were recorded except for one patient experiencing an de Fanconi syndrome at week 2. This add-on pilot study supports the concept of double dose tenofovir to virologically overcome the decreased sensitivity of NRTI-resistant viruses. However, the safety of this regimen needs to be considered carefully."

The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."
5323,0.005,5.0,"In epidemiologic studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus compared with women with similar treatment histories. We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

1456,0.005,5.0,"In untreated, asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, elevated serum concentrations of soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR) types I and II are associated with progression to AIDS. To assess the utility of sTNFRs as markers for the assessment of antiretroviral treatment, sTNFRs were sequentially determined in 47 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men, who participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Progression to AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex occurred in six zidovudine (ZDV)- and six placebo-treated subjects. During ZDV treatment (n = 28) both types of sTNFRs declined compared with baseline and placebo, whereas they increased during placebo treatment (n = 19). A sustained decline of sTNFRs occurred only in subjects who experienced no disease progression. During the first 3 months of ZDV treatment, the hazard ratio for disease progression when sTNFR type II rose above the baseline value plus 5% was significantly increased (hazard ratio: approximately 25; 95% confidence interval: approximately 1.5-400; p < 0.03). Simultaneously determined CD4+ counts and serum neopterin levels showed a similar pattern in progressors and nonprogressors. Thus, in contrast to CD4+ counts and neopterin levels, sTNFR concentrations, especially those of the type II STNFR, appear to be valuable surrogate markers for monitoring the efficacy of ZDV treatment in asymptomatic HIV-1 infection."
2022,0.005,5.0,"Intracellular delivery of novel macromolecular drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), including antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, ribozymes and therapeutic genes, may be achieved by encapsulation in or association with certain types of liposomes. Liposomes may also protect these drugs against nucleases. Low-molecular-weight, charged antiviral drugs may also be delivered more efficiently via liposomes. Liposomes were targeted to HIV-1-infected cells via covalently coupled soluble CD4. An HIV-1 protease inhibitor encapsulated in conventional negatively charged multilamellar liposomes was about 10-fold more effective and had a lower EC90 than the free drug in inhibiting HIV-1 production in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The drug encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes was as effective as the free drug. The EC50 of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) was reduced by an order of magnitude when delivered to HIV-1-infected macrophages in pH-sensitive liposomes. A 15-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against the Rev response element was ineffective in free form against HIV-1 replication in macrophages, while delivery of the oligonucleotide in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus replication. The oligodeoxynucleotide encapsulated in sterically stabilized pH-sensitive liposomes with prolonged circulation in vivo, which were recently developed in the laboratories of the authors, was also highly effective. A ribozyme complementary to HIV-1 5'-LTR delivered in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus production by 90%, while the free ribozyme caused only a slight inhibition. Cationic liposome-mediated co-transfection of the HIV-regulated diphtheria toxin A fragment gene and a proviral HIV clone into HeLa cells completely inhibited virus production, while the frame-shifted mutant gene was ineffective. Co-transfection of the proviral genome and a gene encoding a Rev-binding aptamer into HeLa cells via transferrin-associated cationic liposomes inhibited virus production. These studies indicate that liposomes can be used to facilitate the intracellular delivery of certain anti-HIV agents and to enhance their therapeutic effects. These properties may be particularly advantageous in the development of novel macromolecular drugs, which may be necessary because of the emergence of virus strains resistant to the currently available drugs."
3726,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) was studied by Southern blot analysis in liver biopsy specimens from 75 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver disease living in southern Italy. Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication. However, they suggest that low-level HBV replication may have an important role in causing liver damage also among HDV-infected patients, in a population where the spreading of HBV and HDV is a naturally occurring event."
6100,0.005,5.0,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

The objective is to describe the standard of care received by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) at enrollment into one of five Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Sites located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This cross-sectional study describes the presence of opportunistic infections (OIs), AIDS status and two types of standard of care received by 707 PLWH/A participating in SPNS. Patients receiving care through SPNS in one of the five sites between June 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 were invited to participate to the medical chart review component of the study. The association between sociodemographic variables and the prevalence of OIs and AIDS at enrollment was estimated using multivariate hierarchical logistic models. More than one quarter of the 707 participants had at least one OI recorded and 58% of new and 60% of existing patients had AIDS at enrollment in SPNS. The association between being Hispanic and having higher prevalence of OI and AIDS at entry varied by SPNS site. Standard of care was well followed overall. This is the first study describing HIV stage and OI prevalences and standard of care in PLWH/A in all U.S.-Mexico bordering states. Being of Hispanic ethnicity may not fully explain discrepancy in access to care along the border."

We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak."

The Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Studies included a mail survey of 176 HIV medical care facilities in four US inner cities on clinic characteristics, services and practices, and patient characteristics. Characteristics of 143 (85%) responding Ryan White (RW) funded and non-RW funded facilities are described. RW funded facilities reported offering more services than non-funded facilities including evening/weekend hours (49% vs. 18%), transportation (71% vs. 22%), and on-site risk reduction counselling (88% vs. 55%). More RW funded facilities reported offering on-site adherence support services, such as support groups (44% vs. 12%), formal classes (20% vs. 2%), and pillboxes (83% vs. 43%), and served a larger proportion of uninsured patients (41% vs. 4%) than non-funded facilities. Our analysis showed that the RW funded HIV care facilities offered more clinic, non-clinic, and adherence support services than non-RW funded facilities, indicating that the disparities in services were still related to CARE Act funding, controlling for private-public facility type."

To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."

All patients naïve to antiretrovirals who had > or =1 genotypic resistance testing at the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, Northern Italy) between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Primary resistance mutations were defined using epidemiological and clinical criteria. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford University Algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possible predictors of primary resistance mutations. Among 569 patients, 11% presented > or =1 mutation. Prevalence of primary resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) was 6.3%, 6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The most frequent mutations to NRTI were substitutions at position 215 (215Y in 3 patients, and 215 revertants in 16), 41L (13), 219Q (12), and 210W (10). Among mutations to NNRTI, 103N was found in 21 patients, while 181C, 188L, and 190A/S in 8, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Fifty-one patients (9%) had high-to-intermediate resistance to > or =1 antiretroviral drug before starting the treatment. Regarding the new generation drugs, nine patients had intermediate resistance to etravirine, five patients had intermediate resistance to tipranavir, while five, one, and seven patients had low resistance to etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir. Homosexuals were more likely to harbor a virus with primary resistance mutations (OR:2.68; 95% CI:1.44-5.00; P = 0.002) while non-Italian nationality was protective (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.17-0.86; P = 0.020). Prevalence of primary resistance mutations suggests that genotypic resistance testing should be performed before starting treatment in naïve patients in Italy, particularly when NNRTI are prescribed."
7159,0.005,5.0,The effect of universal hepatitis B vaccination on the prevalence of serologically negative hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and the emergence of HBsAg variants is unknown. We prospectively studied two different cohorts of 12--24 month old children in South Africa. They consisted of the unvaccinated children (n=459) born before the introduction of universal vaccination and the vaccinated children (n=1213) between 1 and 2 years after the introduction of the vaccination program. The frequency of detecting HBV DNA by PCR was reduced from 6.5% in unvaccinated children to 0.3% in vaccinated children (P<0.00001). There were no unique amino acid substitutions within the major hydrophilic region of the S sequence in both pre- and post-vaccination samples. Universal childhood vaccination reduced the frequency of serologically negative HBV infection and did not necessarily lead to selection of escape variants.

The specific aims of the current analysis were to determine (1) the prevalence of HCV infection in a large cohort of patients undergoing retransplantation, (2) define the impact of HCV infection on patient survival, and (3) determine the predictors of outcome of HCV-positive patients undergoing retransplantation for graft failure not caused by primary nonfunction."

Symptomatic raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure can be treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion (VPS). In HIV-infected patients however, there is a concern that VPS might be associated with unacceptably high rates of mortality. We aim to systematically review and appraise published literature to determine reported outcomes and identify predictors of outcome following VPS in relevant subgroups of HIV-infected adults."
8334,0.005,5.0,"Medication adherence is a complex behaviour with multiple determinants. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of adherence is invaluable for programme improvement, which assists the foundation of adherence intervention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Addis Ababa in 2008, to explore barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected paediatric patients. Twelve caregivers of adherent and non-adherent children and 14 key informants in five hospitals were included in the study. The findings revealed that over-dosage (heavy pill burden), fear of stigma and discrimination, cost and access to transportation, lack of understanding of the benefit of taking the medication, economic problems in the household, and lack of nutritional support were the barriers to adherence to HAART. The presence of mobile/wall alarm, the presence of follow-up counselling, improved health of the child, ART clinic setups, and disclosure of HIV serostatus were among the facilitators. This study indicated that paediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy faces a huge challenge. It suggests the provision of income-generating schemes to caregivers for assisting HIV-infected children. Health care providers should address proper usage of medication reminders."
7435,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share overlapping, large worldwide distribution. The implications of coinfection are being explored because of the importance of these viruses and demographic factors that favor coinfection. The nervous system is affected by HIV in a variety of ways resulting in significant disease of all levels of the nervous system. Emerging evidence that HCV can also impact the nervous system raises concerns that detrimental interactions might occur. Several reports addressing the manifestations of coinfection support independent contributions for both HIV and HCV on central nervous system performance, but not on distal sensory neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing reveals independent contributions resulting in poorer performance in coinfection in several drug-abusing cohorts. Motor physiologic testing substantiates performance deficits from HCV in coinfected subjects as does testing in treatment naive coinfected subjects. Although ongoing deficits attributed to HCV may be seen during HIV treatment, these deficits may be less apparent in advanced HIV disease. Current evidence supports independent contributions of HCV and HIV to neurological impairment. Preliminary evidence suggests that coinfection-related impairment does not appear to accelerate HIV-1-associated cognitive disease."
9870,0.005,5.0,"Human antibody response to Cryptosporidium parvum has been previously shown as involving immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG isotypes. The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
9473,0.005,5.0,"In order to verify the occurrence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, 100 HIV/AIDS patients (Group 1) and 85 clinically healthy individuals (Group 2) were submitted to coproparasitological examination. Intestinal parasites were detected in 27% of patients from Group 1 and in 17.6% from Group 2. In Group 1 the most frequent parasites were Strongyloides stercoralis (12%), with 2 cases of hyperinfection; Isospora belli, 7%; Cryptosporidium sp., 4%; with 1 asymptomatic case and hookworm, 4%. Of the infected patients from Group 1 who reported to be chronic alcoholics, 64.3% had strongyloidiasis. Only 6 of the 27 infected patients from Group 1 were on highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In Group 2 the most frequent parasites were S. stercoralis, 7.1%; hookworm, 7.1% and Giardia lamblia, 3.5%. In conclusion, diagnosing intestinal parasites in HIV/AIDS patients is necessary especially in those who report to be chronic alcoholics or are not on antiretroviral treatment."
6407,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects have increased levels of oxidative stress which could impair immunological function and therefore contribute to the progression of AIDS. These characteristics are usually evaluated at rest and responses to exercise have yet to be evaluated. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a bout of aerobic exercise followed by resistance exercises on antioxidant system in HIV-infected and non-HIV subjects. There were included 14 cases (HIV-positive) and 14 controls (HIV-negative). The exercise protocol consisted of a single session of 20 minutes on a cycloergometer followed by a set of six resistance exercises. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase were measured in plasma samples, total glutathione (TGSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in erythrocytes. T CD4+ cells, T CD8+, viral load, complete blood count, and white blood count were also assessed. All measurements were performed at three times: baseline, after aerobic exercise, and after resistance exercises. At baseline, the HIV group had lower GST activity than controls, but after the exercise session GST values were similar in both groups. Compared to the control group TGSH was significantly lower in the HIV group at baseline, after aerobic and resistance exercises. The control group presented higher TBARS values after aerobic exercise compared to the HIV group. The neutrophil count was lower in the HIV group after aerobic and resistance exercises. These data indicate that HIV-infected subjects had lower antioxidant activity at rest. Physical exercise stimulated the enzymatic activity similarly in both groups."
5107,0.005,5.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
8784,0.005,5.0,"Pigtailed macaques infected with a virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which morphologically resembles aspects of human HIV-associated TMA. Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
8624,0.005,5.0,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."
2221,0.005,5.0,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
1278,0.005,5.0,"HLA and other genetic variants, playing an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, are known to influence tuberculosis (TB) development in HIV-1-positive (HIV+) patients. Because inflammasome genes contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility, we investigated the possible association between polymorphisms in inflammasome genes with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection (HIV+TB+) in a case/control cohort of Brazilian individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymoprhims in 8 inflammasome genes (NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, CARD8, CASP1, IL1B, IL1R, and HSP90) were analyzed in HIV+TB+ Brazilian patients (from Recife, Pernambuco). CARD8 rs6509365 polymorphism was associated with HIV+TB+ (P = 5 × 10(-5)), suggesting a predisposing role of this variant in M. tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV+ subjects (odds ratio = 2.45). This effect is even strong when this allele is combined to CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymoprhim. The results of this study support the novel association between CARD8 gene and HIV+TB+ coinfection, demonstrating that inflammasome genetics could influence HIV-1 infection and the development of opportunistic infection."
4699,0.005,5.0,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."
4573,0.005,5.0,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
6917,0.005,5.0,"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity."
10012,0.005,5.0,"The aim of this study was to analyse the lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected adults to compare them with four patients with acute EBV infection. Lymphocyte subsets in 15 healthy controls, 40 HIV-1-infected adults and 4 EBV-infected patients with infectious mononucleosis were analysed by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping of HIV-1-infected patients in different stages of disease showed a significant reduction in the percentage and absolute count of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, significantly increased percentage of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and an increase in the expression of activation marker HLA-DR compared to controls. The immuno-phenotyping profiles of HIV and EBV infection share some similarities as they both result in the decreased percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Patients with HIV infection could be distinguished from patients with EBV infection by the absolute lymphocytosis and increased expression of HLA-DR seen in the patients with infectious mononucleosis. In conclusion, both HIV-1 and EBV profoundly change the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood. It is our opinion that flow cytometry could be an aid in the rapid distinguishing of patients with suspected primary HIV-1 infection from those with infectious mononucleosis (before serology data are available)."
9302,0.005,5.0,"Both HCV and HIV are common in haemophiliacs previously treated with non-viral-inactivated clotting factor concentrates. Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."
4589,0.005,5.0,"After the identification of HIV-2 in 1986, most of the cases reported have been concentrated in West Africa. We identified a case of HIV-2 infection in São Paulo, Brazil of a 45-year-old female who presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, with a CD4 count of 22 cells/ml. DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."
7009,0.005,5.0,"IgM, IgG, and HBsAg containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) were determined, by conglutinin (K) and C1q assays, for assessing the role of CIC in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 54 HBsAg-negative controls and 85 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HDV markers (HDV antigen and anti-HD) was 24.70% (21/85). CIC were a common feature of HDV infection with 95.24% of patients having at least one abnormal test result. The prevalence of elevated IgM-K, IgG-K, IgM-C1q, and IgG-C1q CIC were 85.71, 85.71, 57.14, and 85.71%, respectively. The prevalence of IgM class CIC were statistically higher in patients with HDV infection than in those without (P = .001 for the K assay and P = .023 for the C1q assay). There was no difference in the prevalence of IgG class CIC. Patients with HDV infection also have significantly higher median levels of IgM K-CIC (P = .002), IgG K-CIC (P = .049), and IgG C1q-CIC (P = .008). In patients with HDV infection, there was positive correlation between IgM C1q-CIC and transaminase levels (r = .519, P = .016 for AST; r = .500, P = .021 for ALT). There was no difference in the prevalence of HBsAg containing CIC between patients with HDV infection (76.19%) and those without (74.60%). In conclusion, IgM class CIC are the major CIC and correlate with disease activity in HDV infection. CIC may play a role in the pathogenesis of HDV infection."
8443,0.005,5.0,A complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) F58 was constructed with specificity to a neutralization-inducing region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The mAb has its major reactivity to the amino acid sequence I--GPGRA in the V3 viral envelope region. All CDRs including several framework amino acids were synthesized from the sequence deduced by cloning and sequencing mAb F58 heavy- and light-chain variable domains. Peptides derived from the third heavy-chain domain (CDR-H3) alone or in combination with the other CDR sequences competed with F58 mAb for the V3 region. The CDR-H3 peptide was chemically modified by cyclization and then inhibited HIV-1 replication as well as syncytium formation by infected cells. Both the homologous IIIB viral strain to which the F58 mAb was induced and the heterologous SF2 strain were inhibited. This synthetic peptide had unexpectedly potent antiviral activity and may be a potential tool for treatment of HIV-infected persons.
5786,0.005,5.0,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
7777,0.005,5.0,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
321,0.005,5.0,"Nosocomial multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people is recognized in Europe and America. We report the first such outbreak in South Africa. Six hospitalized women, identified by DNA fingerprinting, were infected with an outbreak strain of MDR-TB while receiving treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission."

9709,0.005,5.0,"The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."

We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
1255,0.005,5.0,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
3509,0.005,5.0,"There are approximately 240 million patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "
2964,0.005,5.0,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
3566,0.005,5.0,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
4323,0.005,5.0,"Fitness disadvantage of the transitional intermediates compared to the initial R5 viruses has been suggested to constitute one of the blockades to coreceptor switching, explaining the late appearance of X4 viruses. Using a simian model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor switching, we demonstrate in this study that similar molecular evolutionary pathways to coreceptor switch occur in more than one R5 simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(SF162P3N)-infected macaque. In infected animals where multiple pathways for expansion or switch to CXCR4 coexist, fitness of the transitional intermediates in coreceptor usage efficiency influences their outgrowth and representation in the infecting virus population. Dualtropic and X4 viruses appear at different disease stages, but they have lower entry efficiency than the coexisting R5 strains, which may explain why they do not outcompete the R5 viruses. Similar observations were made in two infected macaques with coreceptor switch, providing in vivo evidence that fitness disadvantage is an obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion."
615,0.005,5.0,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule of the innate immune system and a competent to bind carbohydrates of a variety of microorganisms, resulting in complement activation and opsonophagocytosis against various pathogens. However, there is no systemic investigation on the MBL's role in innate immune responses against HIV-1 infection among northern Han Chinese. This study investigated the association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. A total of 91 HIV-1 infected patients and 91 HIV-1 seronegative healthy individuals were recruited. Six polymorphisms of MBL2 gene were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of serum MBL concentration and MBL complex activity were performed by ELISA. The CD4+ T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma viral loads of 91 HIV-1 infected patients were determined by bDNA method. The results show that there is an association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. The individuals with B variant, low serum MBL concentration and low MBL complex activity are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection."
6558,0.005,5.0,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."
2776,0.005,5.0,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
7444,0.005,5.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."
446,0.005,5.0,"The paper describes some preliminary attempts to formulate simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of HIV infection in homosexual communities. In conjunction with a survey of the available epidemiological data on HIV infection and the incidence of AIDS, the models are used to assess how various processes influence the course of the initial epidemic following the introduction of the virus. Models of the early stages of viral spread provide crude methods for estimating the basic reproductive rate of the virus, given a knowledge of the incubation period of the disease (AIDS) and the initial doubling time of the epidemic. More complex models are formulated to assess the influence of variation in the incubation period and heterogeneity in sexual activity. The latter factor is shown to have a major effect on the predicted pattern of the epidemic; high levels of heterogeneity decrease its magnitude. Areas of biological uncertainty, future research needs, and public health implications are discussed."
2383,0.005,5.0,"We review studies examining the quality and quantity of social relationships as potential risk factors for differential progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several well-conducted prospective studies suggest that the health effects associated with the presence of supportive social relationships vary according to disease stage and mode of transmission. For gay or bisexual males in the early stages of infection, the presence of supportive social relationships appears to be a risk factor for accelerated disease progression. For individuals in the later stages of infection and those who acquire HIV via intravenous drug use or transfusion, supportive social relationships appear to be associated with health protective effects similar to those observed in other disease settings. We consider a variety of potential explanations for accelerated disease progression in gay men with extensive networks of personal relationships."
9519,0.005,5.0,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."

1383,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during pregnancy is a condition that requires multidisciplinary care. Care must be rendered that is appropriate for both the mother and the fetus. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is of paramount concern. To prevent transmission, universal testing for HIV infection in pregnant women is ideal. In the United States and other developed countries, great strides have been made toward decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to infants to <2% with use of a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the antepartum period and during labor and delivery, scheduled cesarean section when appropriate, avoidance of breast-feeding, and 6 weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis for infants. The continuation of antiretroviral therapy after delivery depends on the needs of the mother with regard to treatment of her own health. In resource-limited countries, where simplified and shortened courses of antiretroviral regimens have been used, reduction in mother-to-child transmission has also been shown, although not as effectively as that with highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these settings, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is recommended to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission."
6570,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however, largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown. "

7846,0.005,5.0,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."

Significant associations were found between HAV and HBV infection, HAV and HCV infection, and HBV and HCV infection. Predictors of total co-infections included age of first injection, lifetime years in jail, and Hispanic ethnicity. Latinos had the highest proportion of HAV and HBV co-infection with HCV. The total number of co-infections, especially those co-infected with all three of the hepatitis infections, was unexpectedly high."

This article systematically reviews recent research advances in the possible barriers of hepatitis B care in APIAs that can be classified into three major categories, i.e., provider-, patient-, and resource-related barriers. The article also provides an overview of multiple approaches to effectively reduce these barriers so that we can evolve better strategy and deliver appropriate care to this special population and eventually reduce health disparity of CHB in APIAs."
3134,0.005,5.0,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."

Median age at presentation was 67 years, and five were female. Nine were asymptomatic at presentation, six presented with varices, five with malaise, three with abdominal pain, one with pruritus and one with oedema. Risk factors identified were: transfusion (7), haemodialysis (1), health care worker (dentist) (1), and tattoos (2). There was no recognized risk factor for infection in 14, but five of these had done military service in areas of high HCV prevalence. Liver biopsy in 20 showed chronic hepatitis in two, cirrhosis in 12, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in six. Three additional patients also developed hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genotyping was done in 19 and all were type 1 (1a, 4; 1b, 14; 1 untypable, 1).

4239,0.005,5.0,"The progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2(HSV-1/2), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections."
3059,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important cause of human chronic liver diseases and is a major public health problem. Viral load and HBV genotype play critical roles in determining clinical outcomes and response to antiviral treatment in hepatitis B patients. Viral genotype detection and quantification assays are currently in use with different levels of effectiveness. In this study, the performance of a real-time genotyping and quantitative PCR (GQ-PCR)-based assay was evaluated. Through the use of genotype-specific primers and probes, this assay provides simultaneous identification and quantification of genotypes B and C in a single reaction. Our GQ-PCR correctly identified all predefined genotypes B and C, and no cross-reaction between genotypes B and C were observed. The GQ-PCR identified more cases of HBV infections with mixed genotypes B and C than direct sequencing did. Samples from 127 HBV-infected Chinese patients were genotyped with GQ-PCR, revealing 56.7% HBV as genotype B, 13.4% as genotype C, and 29.8% as mixed genotypes B and C. This assay provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means for quantification of the B and C genotypes of HBV in single or mixed infections. This assay is suitable for sequential monitoring of viral load levels and for determining the relationship between the genotype viral load and stage of disease in Asians."
3666,0.005,5.0,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."
2984,0.005,5.0,"The objective was to evaluate the association between antiretroviral therapy and AIDS mortality in New York City (NYC). Design was a population-based case-control study. We randomly selected 150 case patients and 150 control patients whose AIDS diagnosis was made during 1994 to 1996 (male:female, 2:1) from among 19,238 persons reported to the NYC Health Department HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Case patients had died of AIDS-related causes in 1996. Control patients, category matched with case patients on gender, were not known to have died by the end of 1996. Analysis was performed on 279 patients (142 cases and 137 controls). Cases and controls were similar in age, gender, race, HIV transmission category, and health insurance coverage. The median baseline CD4 count was 30 cells/microL for those who died and 103 cells/microL for survivors (p < 0.001). The prescription of HAART (antiretroviral combination that includes at least one protease inhibitor) in 1996 was strongly associated with survival in univariate analysis (OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 2.5-10.2). This association remained in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, race, health insurance status, HIV transmission categories, year of AIDS diagnosis, baseline CD4 count, and other antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI = 3.5-20.7). Prescription of combination therapy other than HAART in 1996 and baseline CD4 count were also associated with survival, but less strongly so. The survival benefit of HAART extends beyond the confines of a few highly selected patients into the ""real world,"" reducing AIDS deaths at the population level. This population-based study supports the likelihood that the introduction of HAART in 1996 played a primary role in the decline in NYC AIDS mortality."
1307,0.005,5.0,"Hemodialysis patients potentially have an increased risk of infection with parenterally transmitted viral agents due to an impaired host immune response and multiple transfusion requirements. Viral hepatitis is considered as a problem for hemodialysis patients because 1.9% of all deaths among this population are related to the consequence of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important causes of transmitted infections by the parenteral route in hemodialysis patients. Occult HBV infection is characterized by presence of HBV infection without detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which harbors potential risk of HBV transmission through hemodialysis. There are conflicting reports on the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) in hemodialysis patients. Considering the importance of occult HBV infection in hemodialysis patients and the growing evidence on this subject, the purpose of this review is to provide comprehensive information on OBI prevalence in hemodialysis patients and highlight the most important points in this issue."
6839,0.005,5.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept, formally AG1343) is a potent and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (K(i) = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M8) and 3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxynelfinavir (M1). Antiviral assays with HIV-1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of nelfinavir, M8, and M1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC50 against another HIV-1 strain, IIIB, in MT-2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M8, whereas an approximately 5- to 11-fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M1. The active metabolite, M8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98%). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1.73 to 4.96 microM and the M8 concentrations ranged from 0.55 to 1.96 microM, whereas the M1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.19 microM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease."
1516,0.005,5.0,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
5219,0.005,5.0,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
4625,0.005,5.0,"Twenty-four of over 24,000 patients genotyped over the past 3 years were found to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene insertion mutations in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various insertion mutations on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, insertion mutations can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication."
5796,0.005,5.0,"The molecular epidemiological study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Indonesia is still limited. This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV pre-S deletion/insertion mutations, and to assess the association of pre-S deletion mutation with liver disease progression in Indonesia. Pre-S mutations were identified by direct sequencing. Of the 265 subjects, 32 samples (12.1%) harbored pre-S deletion/insertion mutations. The prevalence of those pre-S mutations was 2.7% (2/75), 12.9% (8/62), 16.7% (11/66), and 17.7% (11/62) in asymptomatic carrier, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma groups, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant difference among them (P = 0.024). In HBV genotype B (HBV/B), pre-S1, pre-S1/S2, and pre-S2 deletion mutations were detected respectively in 3 (17.6%), 4 (23.5%), and 9 (52.9%) of 17 samples. On the other hand, in HBV/C, 12 of 15 samples (80.0%) showed a pre-S2 deletion mutation, and only 2 samples (13.3%) demonstrated a pre-S1/S2 deletion mutation. These results suggest that in HBV/B deletion mutation tends to occur in pre-S1 or pre-S1/S2 region, while in HBV/C the deletion mutation usually occurs in the pre-S2 region. Analysis of complete genome of four viruses confirmed that 3 isolates were classified into HBV/B3, and 1 isolate was HBV/C1. However, SimPlot and BootScan analyses showed that isolate 08.10.002 was an intragenotypic recombinant between HBV/B3 and HBV/B4. As conclusion, the prevalence of HBV pre-S mutations was relatively low in Indonesian patients compared to those from Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries. There was a weak association between pre-S deletion mutation and progressive liver disease."
5872,0.005,5.0,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
8508,0.005,5.0,"We and others have shown that in individual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 is influenced by host immune competence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in addition to selective forces operating within the host, transmission bottlenecks have an impact on HIV-1 intrahost evolution. Therefore, we studied the intrahost evolution of the V3 region of the external glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 during the 3- and 5-year periods following seroconversion after parenteral versus sexual (male-to-male) transmission in 41 participants of the Amsterdam prospective cohorts of homosexual men (n = 31) and intravenous drug users (IVDUs; n = 10) who were AIDS free and had comparable numbers of CD4+ cells. We observed that HIV-1 strains in homosexual men accumulated over 5 years more nonsynonymous substitutions within the V3 loop than HIV-1 strains in IVDUs as a result of lower rates of nonsynonymous evolution in both the initial 3-year period from seroconversion and the following 2-year period as well as a larger proportion of nonsynonymous back substitutions in IVDUs. The mean numbers of synonymous substitutions did not differ between the two risk groups. Since HIV-1 strains in IVDUs could be distinguished from the viruses of homosexual men based on several nucleotide substitutions of which the most conserved is a synonymous substitution at the tip of the V3 loop (GGC pattern), we studied whether the founder virus population itself has an impact on the intrahost evolution of HIV-1. The mean number of nonsynonymous substitutions accumulated over 5 years within the V3 loop was lower in 10 IVDUs infected by the HIV-1 strains with the GGC signature than in 4 IVDUs infected by HIV-1 strains lacking this pattern, while the mean numbers of synonymous substitutions were similar in the two groups."
5450,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "

We report a case of spontaneous recovery of chronic HCV-infection in a HCV-HIV co-infected hemophiliac with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration. Retrospective analysis of frozen blood samples showed that a decrease in HCV-RNA in parallel with the increase of CD4 and CD8-cell counts, accompanied by a peak of transaminases.

33,0.005,5.0,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
307,0.005,5.0,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
5487,0.005,5.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."
2102,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
741,0.005,5.0,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."
6514,0.005,5.0,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
8240,0.005,5.0,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
2353,0.005,5.0,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."

This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "

The stool samples were processed by water-ether sedimentation method; they were stained with Uvitex-2B technique for microscopic detection of intestinal microsporidium. A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia. It has an important implication for the understanding of the aetiology of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients in the country."

Residues 79, 94, and 96 were all found to be phosphorylated, as assessed by alanine mutations. Mutation of Ser-79 to Ala abrogated effects of Vpr on cell cycle progression, whereas mutation of Ser-94 and Ser-96 had no effect.

In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."

Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."

From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
1806,0.005,5.0,"The Patient Knowledge Assessment Study (PKAS) was conducted among 107 male hemophilic patients, aged 15 to 67 years, at 19 hemophilia treatment centers (HTC). Participants were given a 30-item questionnaire concerning the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the groups at risk, and modes of transmission. The questionnaire included questions on the participant's status in regard to antibody to human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), and the meaning of this test result. HTC health-care providers were asked to complete a separate questionnaire containing 17 questions about information given patients concerning their HTLV-III/LAV antibody status and its meaning. Overall, patients had a good base of knowledge about AIDS; however, there were gaps in this knowledge. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not know that spouses of AIDS patients were at risk for AIDS; 47% did not know that sexual partners of persons with hemophilia were at risk; and 32% did not know that hemophilic children were at risk. Further, only 69% understood that antibody-positive individuals had had contact with the AIDS virus. Identifying these and other areas of misunderstanding will provide the information needed to design educational strategies and psychosocial support programs appropriate for the hemophilic population, and which may serve as a model for other populations."
7811,0.005,5.0,"Virological data on chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Greece are limited. HBV genotypes, surface antigen (HBsAg) subtypes, and HBsAg ""a"" determinant mutations among patients infected chronically with HBV, were investigated. Serum samples from 135 HBsAg positive patients were tested. Serologic (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe), virologic (HBV-DNA quantitation) and biochemical markers (serum alanine aminotransferase/ALT and aspartate aminotransferase/AST) were analyzed. HBV genotypes and HBsAg subtypes were determined by partial sequencing of the S gene. Genotyping was performed by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information online Genotyping tool and phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were aligned pair wise with ClustalW and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Sequences were also used to predict HBV HBsAg subtypes. In six patients (4%), simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was determined, whereas 47 patients (35%) were HBeAg positive, 84 (62.5%) were anti-HBe positive, and four patients (3%) were characterized by the simultaneous presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe. Mean ALT was 238 IU/L (standard deviation = 576.84), and HBV-DNA levels ranged from 1.02 × 10(5) to 2.2 × 10(7) IU/ml. Genotype D was predominant (98%), with viral groups D/ayw2 (73%) and D/ayw3 (27%). Group A/adw accounted for 1% of cases. Genotypes B and C were found exclusively in the Chinese immigrants (1%). Single or multiple point mutations were found in 35 cases (26%). Some of the most common mutations occurred at amino acid positions 129, 133, 134, 144, 145, including the ""vaccine escape"" mutation G145R. Mutations analysis revealed that amino acid substitutions did not affect detection by commercial immunoassays."
3643,0.005,5.0,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
7666,0.005,5.0,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
3208,0.005,5.0,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

5506,0.005,5.0,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

9785,0.005,5.0,Five hundred and ten inner city adolescent girls requesting reproductive health services were surveyed about their knowledge and beliefs concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Each patient's survey responses were examined in relation to number of sexual partners and history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Adolescents with the greatest concerns and fears of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were those with multiple sexual partners. Those with the joint effects of multiple sexual partners and a history of STD were the most likely to acknowledge their potential for HIV infection and have a behavioral basis for it. Sexual behaviors within this age group are highlighted and programmatic interventions are suggested.

4607,0.005,5.0,"Maternal samples were assessed from 96 women enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic zidovudine resistance at entry, if zidovudine resistance developed on study, and the role of zidovudine resistance in vertical transmission of HIV-1 despite zidovudine therapy. Low and high levels of genotypic resistance were assessed by differential hybridization, oligoligation, or direct sequencing of plasma HIV-1 RNA for codons K70R and T215Y/F. None of the women had high-level genotypic resistance to zidovudine at study entry or delivery. For low-level zidovudine resistance, the 95% confidence intervals were 0.3%-6.8% for baseline prevalence and 0.3%-14% for delivery incidence. Low-level zidovudine resistance, adjusted for plasma viral RNA level at delivery, was not strongly associated with an increase in vertical transmission risk (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-131; P = .35)."
4664,0.005,5.0,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has become a major global public health problem with rising number of cases and associated deaths. Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."
6076,0.005,5.0,"The transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 647 subjects who presented no apparent risk factors for the infection other than having had promiscuous heterosexual relations, heterosexual relations with people with an elevated risk of infection, or heterosexual relations with people infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty subjects were found to be seropositive for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The elevated risk factors included being the habitual partner of a person at risk of infection or of a person who was infected by human immunodeficiency virus, or being the partner of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The transmission of the virus was verified in 13 of 284 subjects (4.57%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons at risk and in 16 of 101 subjects (15.84%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. No significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus infection and a history of sexually transmitted infections, nor between human immunodeficiency virus infection and female subjects was found. These data suggest that the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can also spread through heterosexual relations, even if the possibility of becoming infected in this way seems at the moment limited to particular risk behaviors."
1546,0.005,5.0,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
5222,0.005,5.0,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
8720,0.005,5.0,"One hundred thirty-four homosexual men from a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk from New York City and Washington D.C. and 139 homosexual men from a similar cohort in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark were questioned regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status over the previous 12 months. Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed."

5574,0.005,5.0,"Eighteen transfusion recipients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were followed prospectively with their 19 long-term sexual partners from 1986 to 1993 in California, Florida, and New York. Follow-up included clinical, behavioral, immunologic, serologic, and virologic evaluations. Two partners were already infected when seen 18 and 34 months after sexual contact began following the infectious transfusion. Four of 17 initially seronegative partners seroconverted during 23 person-years of observation. The recipient's clinical status, mononuclear cell subset variations, and time trend in CD4+ counts had no association with transmission. Individual plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads were stable during observation, and sexual transmission was not attributable to an upward trend or transient burst in viremia. However, recipients who transmitted HIV-1 to their sexual partners had higher mean viral RNA levels than did nontransmitting recipients (4.3 vs. 3.6 log10 copies/ml; p = 0.05). Although this series was small, the prospective observations suggest that viral load was the only characteristic in the recipient that contributed to heterosexual infectiousness."

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
9900,0.005,5.0,"Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) always occurs in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."
3846,0.005,5.0,"Compromised oral health holds significant implications for the general health of medically vulnerable, HIV infected individuals. Past studies have reported that these individuals frequently suffer from oral opportunistic infections and have a tendency to develop severe periodontal disease. This study extends past research by examining the prevalence of oral infections according to patient characteristics and by reporting, for the first time, the level of perceived dental need in a large, multi-site sample of individuals with symptomatic HIV disease. Data for this study come from a survey of 857 clients of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program in 9 U.S. cities. More respondents (52%) reported a need for dental care than for any other service need. Multivariate analysis showed that clients who were white, in low-income groups, used intravenous drugs, or had a past history of oral opportunistic infections were more likely to report dental need. Relations between age, gender, insurance status, or disease status and perceived need were statistically nonsignificant. Forty-seven percent of the clients reported they had an oral opportunistic infection, the second outcome variable examined in this study. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the prevalence of oral opportunistic infections among race and disease severity groups. Whites and the more severely ill were more likely to report an infection than their respective counterparts."
6451,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
4899,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV-1 V3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV-1 env V3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV-1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting that the degree of positive pressure for HIV-1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i.e., that transmission does not reset the evolutionary clock."
8266,0.005,5.0,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
3662,0.005,5.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."

3257,0.005,5.0,"Numerous host and viral factors likely participate in the onset and progression of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). Previous studies have suggested that viral gene expression in resident central nervous system (CNS) cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage play a central role in the production of neurotoxic viral proteins and infectious virus, deregulation of cellular gene expression, and/or dysfunction of glial and neuronal cell populations. HIV-1 replication is regulated, in part, by interactions between cellular transcription factors and the viral trans-activators, Tat and viral protein R (Vpr), with cis-acting promoter elements within the LTR. We have previously demonstrated that Vpr binds with high affinity to selected sequence configurations within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and downstream sequences immediately adjacent to this site. Studies reported herein establish a correlation between the diagnosis of HIVD and the increased prevalence of HIV-1 LTRs containing a C/EBP binding site I that exhibits high affinity for Vpr. To this end, the interaction of Vpr with C/EBP site I variants in 47 LTRs from three nondemented patients and 96 LTRs from seven demented patients was examined. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses were utilized to examine Vpr binding to oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP site I variants. We demonstrated that 89% of LTRs derived from patients exhibiting clinical dementia contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while only 11% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. In contrast, examination of LTRs derived from patients lacking clinically evident dementia revealed that only 53% of brain-derived LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while 47% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. We propose that sequence-specific interactions between cis-acting elements in the LTR, members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, and the virion-associated trans-activator protein Vpr play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD."
5502,0.005,5.0,"The contribution of bipolar disorder (BD), a prevalent serious mental illness characterized by impulsivity and mood instability, to antiretroviral (ART) and psychiatric medication adherence among HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals is unknown. We examined medication adherence among 44 HIV+/BD+ persons as compared to 33 demographically- and medically-comparable HIV+/BD- persons. Classification of adherent (≥ 90%) or non-adherent (<90%) based on proportion of correctly taken doses over 30 days was determined using electronic medication monitoring devices. HIV+/BD+ persons were significantly less likely to be ART adherent (47.7%) as compared to HIV+/BD- (90.9%) persons. Within the HIV+/BD+ group, mean psychiatric medication adherence was significantly worse than ART medication adherence, although there was a significant correlation between ART and psychiatric adherence levels. Importantly, 30-day ART adherence was associated with plasma virologic response among HIV+/BD+ individuals. Given the high overlap of HIV and BD, and the observed medication adherence difficulties for these persons, specialized adherence improvement interventions are needed."
4390,0.005,5.0,"Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are common complications of advanced immunodeficiency in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Neurological disease is the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 10% to 20% of symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such disorders is critical. Also, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these disease states have changed in presentation and epidemiology. Therefore, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of five common central nervous system disorders in individuals with HIV-1 infection: toxoplasma encephalitis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
694,0.005,5.0,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by loss of CD4T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART. The immune reconstitution failure was defined by CD4 cell count increase from baseline of less than 100 CD4 cells/mm"
2034,0.005,5.0,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."

HBV DNA was particularly frequent in HIV-positive patients. Sequencing of the S gene showed that only two HIV-infected patients harboured mutants in the major hydrophilic loop; the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen detection could not be explained by diagnostic escape mutants.
4996,0.005,5.0,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
6532,0.005,5.0,"This study describes the social networks of secondary school students in Moshi Municipality, and their association with self-rated risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 300 students aged 15-24 years in 5 secondary schools in Moshi, Tanzania. Bonding networks were defined as social groupings of students participating in activities within the school, while bridging networks were groups that included students participating in social groupings from outside of the school environs. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participation in bonding and bridging social networks and self-rated HIV risk behavior. More participants participated in bonding networks (72%) than in bridging networks (29%). Participation in bridging networks was greater among females (25%) than males (12%, p<.005). Of 300 participants, 88 (29%) were sexually experienced, and of these 62 (70%) considered themselves to be at low risk of HIV infection. Factors associated with self-rated risk of HIV included: type of school (p<.003), family structure (p<.008), being sexually experienced (p<.004), having had sex in the past three months (p<.009), having an extra sexual partner (p<.054) and non-condom use in last sexual intercourse (p<.001), but not the presence or type of social capital. The study found no association between bonding and bridging social networks on self-rated risk of HIV among study participants. However, sexually experienced participants rated themselves at low risk of HIV infection despite practicing unsafe sex. Efforts to raise adolescents' self-awareness of risk of HIV infection through life skills education and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk reduction strategies may be beneficial to students in this at-risk group."
5606,0.005,5.0,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."
8801,0.005,5.0,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
2498,0.005,5.0,"The spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has gradually decreased in Italy in the last 5 decades as shown by the steady reduction in the incidence rates of acute hepatitis B, from 10/100000 inhabitants in 1984 to 0.85/100000 in 2012, and by the reduced prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cases among chronic hepatitis patients with different etiologies, from 60% in 1975 to about 10% in 2001. The prevalence of HBsAg chronic carriers in the general population also decreased from nearly 3% in the 1980s to 1% in 2010. Linked to HBV by its characteristics of defective virus, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has shown a similar epidemiological impact on the Italian population over time. The incidence of acute HDV infection decreased from 3.2/100000 inhabitants in 1987 to 0.8/100000 in 2010 and the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg chronic carriers decreased from 24% in 1990 to 8.5% in 2006. Before the beneficial effects of HBV mass vaccination introduced in 1991, the decreased endemicity of HBV and HDV infection in Italy paralleled the improvement in screening blood donations, the higher standard of living and impressive reduction in the birth rate associated with a marked reduction in the family size. A further contribution to the decline in HBV and HDV infections most probably came from the media campaigns to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection by focusing the attention of the general population on the same routes of transmission of viral infections such as unsafe sexual intercourse and parenteral exposures of different kinds.

3494,0.005,5.0,"During the period May 1987 to November 1989, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was determined by ELISA in serum samples of 7405 (55% male, 45% female) apparently healthy persons 3-19 years of age in Italy. Earlier studies of adults there had shown an intermediate degree of HBV endemicity (hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate greater than 2%). Persons were selected by systematic cluster sampling in five different geographical areas of Italy. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 0.6%. The overall prevalence of at least one marker of HBV was 2.8%; it increased from 1.7% among children 3-5 years of age to 4.5% in teenagers 17-19 years of age (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of any HBV marker was higher in southern then in northern areas (3.5% vs. 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A significant association was found with sociodemographic features. Persons whose fathers had less than 6 years of schooling had a 2.3-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.5-3.4) while those belonging to a household of six or more under one roof had a 1.7-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.2-2.4) of previous exposure to HBV infection. These findings indicate that, today in Italy, exposure to HBV infection at a young age is very low and suggest a shift towards a low degree of endemicity following improvements in socio-economic conditions, decreased family size and increasing use of disposable syringes during recent years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9196,0.005,5.0,"Because of the increasing availability of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV in low-income countries, many clinicians now need training on their use. This is especially true for clinicians caring for individuals with tuberculosis (TB), given its close relationship with HIV/AIDS. This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

2578,0.005,5.0,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

1303,0.005,5.0,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence. People living with HIV who have poor health literacy skills may benefit from medication adherence programs and requests for assistance afford opportunities for social interventions."

Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."

Two groups were evaluated: those who had achieved HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA <500 copies/mL, group 1, n=21) and those who had achieved incomplete HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA>500 copies/mL, group 2, n=14) at the time of study entry. NFV one-hour pre-dose concentrations were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (P=0.023). The NFV AUC(0.5-4) for group 1 approached significance (P=0.068). No significant differences in IDV concentrations or AUC(0.5-4) were found between group 1 and group 2. It is feasible to use PI drug level monitoring in the outpatient setting."

Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."

Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients.

9509,0.005,5.0,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."

We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."
5915,0.005,5.0,"We describe preliminary molecular characterization of HIV-1 pol from 108 consecutive HIV seropositive users of a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) site of Porto Alegre city, the major metropolitan area in the south of Brazil. Protease and partial reverse transcriptase regions were retrotranscribed from plasma HIV-1 RNA and sequenced after direct nested PCR. Principal antiretroviral resistance mutations (ARM) were observed in 3% of the samples, two cases with K103N and one with M41L, L210W and T215Y, all in HIV-1 clade B infected men. At protease region, no principal mutations were observed, but polymorphisms at secondary codons were frequent. Contrary to other areas in the country where clade B dominates, HIV-1 clade C genomes predominated in this study (58%), clade B (32%) and clade F1 (3%). Of the genomes clustering in clade C, almost half (43%) had a small clade B segment at reverse transcriptase, forming a sub-cluster within clade C with a similar recombinant structure and carrying new amino acid signatures. Other mosaic genomes were also observed (7%). The low prevalence of resistance mutations is consistent with previous observations at this geographical location but the high frequency of HIV-1 clade C and CB mosaics seems pre-eminent and warns close monitoring."
1096,0.005,5.0,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."
5653,0.004,4.0,"The reasons for the viral persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are unknown, but are probably related to host immune factors. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can regulate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-3 and -9 genes on the susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. We studied 489 Korean patients with HBV infection (144 inactive carriers, 182 chronic hepatitis, and 163 liver cirrhosis) and 174 healthy individuals who had recovered from HBV infection. MMP-3 gene SNPs were identified at two polymorphic sites (codon 45 [E45K] and codon 96 [D96D]) and MMP-9 gene SNPs at three polymorphic sites (codon 279 [R279Q], codon 607 [G607G], and codon 668 [Q668R]) in study subjects. The frequency of T allele at third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene was higher in HBV persistence patients when analyzed by co-dominant model (age- and sex-adjusted OR=1.242, 95% CI= 1.001-1.540, p=0.049). In conclusion the T allele at the third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene might be associated with persistent HBV infection."

991,0.004,4.0,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversions have been considered as outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of needle exchange programs. To assess the relationships between incident HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs), seroconversions were prospectively studied among a cohort of 240 HBV- and HIV- seronegative IDUs. The incidence of HBV seroconversion declined from 24.41/100 person-years in 1988 to 0 seroconversions in 1992. In contrast, HIV seroconversion rates varied little from the overall rate of 3.29/100 person-years. HBV seroconversion predicted subsequent HIV seroconversion among male IDUs (relative incidence [RI]= 4.23) but not among female IDUs (RI=0.86). Because of different transmission dynamics, HBV seroconversion probably has limited utility as a surrogate outcome measure for incident HIV. However, HBV seroconversion itself is an appropriate and important outcome measure for evaluation of prevention programs among IDUs."
455,0.004,4.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and shows a propensity to metastasize and infiltrate adjacent and more distant tissues. HCC is associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is especially prevalent in China. Here, we used exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in ten HBV-positive individuals with HCC with portal vein tumor thromboses (PVTTs), intrahepatic metastases. Both C:G>A:T and T:A>A:T transversions were frequently found among the 331 non-silent mutations. Notably, ARID1A, which encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was mutated in 14 of 110 (13%) HBV-associated HCC specimens. We used RNA interference to assess the roles of 91 of the confirmed mutated genes in cellular survival. The results suggest that seven of these genes, including VCAM1 and CDK14, may confer growth and infiltration capacity to HCC cells. This study provides a view of the landscape of somatic mutations that may be implicated in advanced HCC."
8664,0.004,4.0,"Since some hepatitis viruses and the human immunodeficiency viruses share common modes of transmission, such as the sexual route, we undertook to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to these and other pathogens among 384 rural pregnant women. Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."
5168,0.004,4.0,"The present study examined the comparative efficacy of intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient dyadic level, versus the individual caregiver level, for caregivers and their care-recipients with HIV/AIDS. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dyad Intervention (DI), a Caregiver Intervention (CI) or Wait List Control group (WLC), and assessed by interview and self-administered scales immediately before treatment and eight weeks later. Participants in the intervention groups also completed a four-month follow-up assessment. Dependent variables included global distress, social adjustment, dyadic adjustment, subjective health status, HIV/AIDS knowledge and target problem ratings. Results showed that caregivers in the DI group showed greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on global distress, dyadic adjustment and target problems than the CI and WLC caregivers. The CI and DI caregivers showed greater improvement than the WLC group on all dependent variables except social adjustment. Care-recipients in the DI group improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment on dyadic adjustment, social adjustment, knowledge, subjective health status and Target Problem 1, whereas the CI and WLC care-recipients failed to improve on any of these measures. The treatment gains made by the DI caregivers and care-recipients on most dependent variables were maintained at a four-month follow-up. Findings support a reciprocal determinism approach to the process of dyadic adjustment and suggest that intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient level may produce better outcomes for both the caregiver and care-recipient than intervening at the individual caregiver level."
1237,0.004,4.0,"African green monkeys (AGMs) are naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) at high prevalence levels and do not progress to AIDS. Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."
204,0.004,4.0,Clinical trials were conducted to assess the feasibility of using a cell phone text messaging-based system to follow up Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral (ARTs) and assess for improved adherence to their medication. However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the perceptions of HIV infected patients on the use of cell phone text messaging as a tool to support adherence to their ART medication.
3379,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
8329,0.004,4.0,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
1457,0.004,4.0,"Measures of sexual health were assessed during 2008-2009 in a New York City sample of 102 injection and noninjection users of heroin, cocaine, or crack. There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."

3610,0.004,4.0,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."
7335,0.004,4.0,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."

Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."

5618,0.004,4.0,"Monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection is associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers and increased risk for premature development of age-related diseases. Because activated monocytes primarily use glucose to support cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection induces a hypermetabolic response with increased glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expression and glucose uptake by monocyte subpopulations in HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) treatment-naive individuals (n = 17), HIV(+) individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy with viral loads below detection (n = 11), and HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals (n = 16). Surface expression of Glut1 and cellular uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose were analyzed by flow cytometry on monocyte subpopulations. Irrespective of treatment status, monocytes from HIV(+) persons had significantly increased surface expression of Glut1 compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) and intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocyte subpopulations showed higher Glut1 expression than did classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes. Intermediate monocytes from treatment-naive HIV(+) individuals also showed increased uptake of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Our results show that HIV infection is associated with increased glucose metabolism in monocytes and that Glut1 expression by proinflammatory monocytes is a potential marker of inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. However, the possibility exists whereby other Gluts such as Glut3 and Glut4 may also support the influx of glucose into activated and inflammatory monocyte populations. "
3760,0.004,4.0,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
6449,0.004,4.0,"Epidemiological data on hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Belgium are lacking. A multicenter questionnaire-based registry on HDV infection was collated between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2009. It consisted of patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV. The data samples were compared to those of a concurrent registry on HBV infection. Prospective data of patients with HBV-HDV coinfection were collected. Active HBV replication is defined as HBeAg positivity or HBV DNA > 2,000 IU/ml. Forty-four patients from 15 centers were registered. A comparison of 29 patients infected with HDV (registered in the concurrent HBV registry) was made against 785 HBV mono-infected patients. The seroprevalence of patients coinfected with HBV and HDV in Belgium is reported to be 3.7% (29/785), consisting solely of the HBV-HDV coinfected patients in the HBV registry. This rises to 5.5% (44/800) if all patients infected with HDV from the two registries combined are included. The patients coinfected with HBV and HDV had higher (P < 0.05) ALT values and more advanced liver disease (Metavir score ≥F2), but had less active HBV replication and lower HBV DNA titers when compared with the patients infected only with HBV. Additionally, the majority of HBV-HDV coinfected patient was male, and 13.6% (6/44) of the patients that were coinfected HBV and HDV were also infected with HCV. In conclusion, this study provided much needed epidemiological data on the current state of HDV infection in Belgium."
2954,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
1820,0.004,4.0,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
8848,0.004,4.0,"Using the Southern blot technique and cloned hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a probe, we studied the state of HBV DNA in the liver of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 2 patients with acute hepatitis. The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."
3898,0.004,4.0,"Retroviral integration requires cis-acting sequences at the termini of linear double-stranded viral DNA and a product of the retroviral pol gene, the integrase protein (IN). IN is required and sufficient for generation of recessed 3' termini of the viral DNA (the first step in proviral integration) and for integration of the recessed DNA species in vitro. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN, expressed in Escherichia coli, was purified to near homogeneity. The substrate sequence requirements for specific cleavage and integration of retroviral DNA were studied in a physical assay, using purified IN and short duplex oligonucleotides that correspond to the termini of HIV DNA. A few point mutations around the IN cleavage site substantially reduced cleavage; most other mutations did not have a drastic effect, suggesting that the sequence requirements are limited. The terminal 15 bp of the retroviral DNA were demonstrated to be sufficient for recognition by IN. Efficient specific cutting of the retroviral DNA by IN required that the cleavage site, the phosphodiester bond at the 3' side of a conserved CA-3' dinucleotide, be located two nucleotides away from the end of the viral DNA; however, low-efficiency cutting was observed when the cleavage site was located one, three, four, or five nucleotides away from the terminus of the double-stranded viral DNA. Increased cleavage by IN was detected when the nucleotides 3' of the CA-3' dinucleotide were present as single-stranded DNA. IN was found to have a strong preference for promoting integration into double-stranded rather than single-stranded DNA."
5570,0.004,4.0,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters."
3904,0.004,4.0,"A solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determining human serum cystatin C is described. In 50 normal samples, cystatin C concentration was 1247 +/- 224 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD) which is in agreement with previously reported levels. Serum levels of cystatin C and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) were investigated in a time-course study during the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We found a persistent and uniform increase in the beta 2-M concentration (2762 +/- 1239 micrograms/L). In contrast to beta 2-M, on the basis of cystatin C levels, we found two distinct populations, one of which demonstrated an increased concentration (1620 +/- 618 micrograms/L). Interestingly a second group (21% of patients) exhibited an initial significant decrease in cystatin C concentration with a mean value of 377 (range 55-850) micrograms/L, followed by an increase. The biphasic pattern of cystatin C serum, a major cysteine proteinase inhibitor, during the course of HIV infection suggests a possible role for these proteinases (or proteinase inhibitors) in the development of this syndrome."
3876,0.004,4.0,"We assessed the longitudinal changes in blood myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) populations in subjects with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergoing different rates of disease progression. The relative level and degree of maturation of all cell populations decreased significantly in untreated individuals with acute infection. The most dramatic changes were observed in the rapid progressor group, correlating with their rate of clinical progression. Levels of mDCs remained lower than normal throughout follow-up for both rapid progressors who responded to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and untreated normal progressors. In contrast, mDC precursors were restored to normal levels during subsequent phases of infection in both rapid and normal progressors, and these levels were increased in long-term nonprogressors. pDC levels followed the pattern of CD4+ T cell fluctuations. These findings provide evidence for an ongoing process affecting mDCs after successful ART and despite nonprogressing clinical disease following HIV infection."
3503,0.004,4.0,"We have sought to address the problem of the host and tissue specificity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) by using transgenic mice obtained after injection of head-to-tail dimers of the HBV genome. Viral DNA replication and protein synthesis were obtained in one of nine transgenic mice containing integrated HBV DNA. The RNAs encoding the HBV surface antigen and the core antigen were synthesized in the liver, the kidney, and the heart. In these organs, DNA replicative intermediates similar to those found during normal infection were associated with corelike structures. Large amounts of core polypeptides and capsids were detected in the nuclei in the absence of any pathological effect. These results show that the different steps of HBV multiplication can take place in nonliver nonhuman cells once the problem of entry into the host cell is overcome. In the absence of a small laboratory animal infectable by HBV, such transgenic mice should be helpful for the study of many aspects of viral multiplication."
1297,0.004,4.0,"Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated an association between use of hormonal contraceptives and shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This prospective study evaluated the effect of initiating use of hormonal contraception on cervical HSV detection. Two hundred women who were seropositive for HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were examined for cervical mucosal HSV by use of quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction before and after beginning the use of hormonal contraceptives. Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16.0%) before initiating and in 25 women (12.5%) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P=.4). There were no significant differences in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting combination oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cervical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was -313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV."
9951,0.004,4.0,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
3271,0.004,4.0,"Columbia University's International Centre for AIDS Care and Treatment Programmes (ICAP) supports the establishment of HIV prevention, care and treatment programmes, in resource-limited countries, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In South Africa (SA), ICAP has collaborated with the Eastern Cape Department of Health since 2004, to support HIV treatment and care programmes at public healthcare facilities in rural and urban areas. Adherence, psychosocial and other supportive services have been combined into Wellness Programmes that have been situated within hospital-based Wellness Centres in two rural regions, and integrated within primary healthcare facilities in a third. This paper reviews components of wellness services for people living with HIV/AIDS including: voluntary counselling and testing, disclosure and prevention, ongoing counselling, health literacy and peer education, community- and home-based care, adherence support, and associated comprehensive care continuums. It also describes local context in which the Wellness Programmes were established. Finally it describes processes, successes and challenges, with programme development, and useful indicators monitored, lessons learned and strategies to strengthen and expand such programmes. Insights provided may inform other efforts to create sustainable systems of interdisciplinary care and accessible psychosocial support for HIV-infected persons within public facilities in resource-constrained settings."
4601,0.004,4.0,"Patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important for effective medical treatment of HIV/AIDS. We conducted a qualitative interview study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia in 2006. The aim of the study was to explore patients' and health care professionals' perceived barriers and facilitators to patients' adherence to ART. Based on data from individual interviews and focus group interviews with a total of 60 patients and 12 health care professionals, we identified barriers and facilitators related to patients' beliefs and behaviours, the health service, and socio-economic and cultural factors. Among the barriers we identified were lack of communication and information about ART, inadequate time during consultations, lack of follow-up and counselling, forgetfulness, stigma, discrimination and disclosure of HIV status, lack of confidentiality in the treatment centres, and lack of nutritional support. Feeling better, prospects of living longer, family support, information about ART, support for income-generating activities, disclosure of HIV status, prayers and transport support were among the facilitators. Our study suggests that several issues need to be considered when providing ART. Further research is needed to study interactions between patients and their health care providers. Our findings can inform interventions to improve adherence to ART."
3709,0.004,4.0,"While community-based mental health services play an important role in caring for persons with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and co-existing mental health disorders, the extent to which their support needs are addressed in this setting is unknown. Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains]. Despite living in a setting with universal health insurance, men with HIV receiving community mental health support had greater unmet need in basic and health domains than HIV-negative men receiving such support. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions to best support community-dwelling persons with HIV and mental health disorders."
2683,0.004,4.0,"The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III DUET studies enrolled treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients. We examined the genotypic and phenotypic changes at endpoint relative to baseline, including the emergence of individual reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations, in patients who received the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine and experienced virologic failure by rebound by the time of the Week 96 analysis. Patients received etravirine 200 mg twice-daily in combination with a background regimen containing darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. Virologic failure by rebound occurred in 93 (15.5%) etravirine-treated patients (compared with 170 [28.1%] placebo-treated patients). Patients experiencing virologic failure had more baseline antiretroviral resistance and lower activity of the background regimen relative to those not experiencing failure. Emergence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was observed in 55 of 93 patients. The most frequently emerging RT mutations were V179F, V179I, and Y181C, with positions K101 and E138 also showing frequent changes. Mutations usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI mutations and were, in most cases, associated with a decrease in phenotypic sensitivity to etravirine at endpoint. Further analysis is needed to clarify the role of mutations at position 138 as determinants of etravirine resistance."
7432,0.004,4.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus share common routes of transmission, and hence, coinfection with these two viruses is common. Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."
6179,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may easily be selected for in vitro and in vivo under a suboptimal therapy regimen. Although cross-resistance is extensive within this class of compounds, newer NNRTIs were reported to retain activity against laboratory strains containing defined resistance-associated mutations. We have characterized HIV-1 resistance to loviride and the extent of cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term loviride monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to loviride ranged from 0.04 to 3.47 log10-fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued loviride for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K103N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K103N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. The Y181C substitution was detected in one isolate which was resistant to loviride and delavirdine but sensitive to efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine. Our data indicate that the available newer NNRTIs which retain activity against some HIV-1 strains selected by other compounds of this class in vitro may have compromised clinical efficacy in some patients pretreated with NNRTI."
2026,0.004,4.0,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."

Review of the literature on leptospirosis in HIV-infected persons showed that all patients were severely ill but responded well to treatment, which highlights the importance of recognizing this potentially life-threatening illness, especially in unusual settings."
1511,0.004,4.0,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
8226,0.004,4.0,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
6954,0.004,4.0,"We documented HIV-risk behavior and the public health context of AIDS in women living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Sixty-one women were recruited from outpatient clinics and day-treatment programs at a state psychiatric hospital. They completed a survey that included measures of HIV-related risk behavior, the perceived importance of 11 public health and social problems including AIDS, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, perceived risk, and behavioral intentions. Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in at least one type of HIV-risk behavior during the 2 months before assessment, 23% reported two or more risk factors, and 16% reported three or more risk factors. Consistent condom use was rare. Participants reporting 1 or more risk factors were more likely than those reporting no risk to report histories of alcohol or drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing, and more perceived risk of HIV infection. Poverty and unemployment were viewed as more serious problems than HIV infection and AIDS. HIV-prevention interventions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women with a severe mental illness are urgently needed to prevent further infections."
4240,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
878,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major issue among dialysis patients. It is associated with a high risk of hepatic complication. The liver disease runs a unique clinical course in dialysis patients, as it can progress with modest hepatic inflammation and prominent fibrosis. The conventional cut-off level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for commencing antiviral therapy may prove too high and inappropriate for dialysis patients, and liver biopsy appears to be the only definitive means to establish the activity of liver disease in dialysis patients. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a serum ALT level that is persistently greater than 30 IU/L, or 0.75-fold the upper limit of the normal level, and/or other clinical and laboratory findings that suggest active liver disease. For antiviral treatment, preliminary reports have shown that lamivudine is effective and well tolerated in dialysis patients. However, the long-term efficacy of lamivudine and its optimal effective dose in dialysis patients remain unknown. The prevention of nosocomial transmission among dialysis patients is also important. Universal precaution measures should be strictly observed and the segregation of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hemodialysis patients should be considered. For HBV non-immune patients, the importance of HBV vaccination should not be overemphasized. Until a new generation of highly immunogenic vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease becomes available, early vaccination before the development of end-stage renal failure remains the best way to secure immunological protection against HBV infection in dialysis patients."
904,0.004,4.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a complex phenomenon and patients do not always adhere for a variety of reasons. The quality of communication and the therapeutic relationship between health professionals and patients have an important influence on adherence, as do contextual and environmental factors. Little qualitative research exists that examines health care interactions in the context of adherence counselling. This article presents a case study of a discussion about nonadherence between a pharmacy assistant and a patient in a South African HIV context. A hybrid analytical approach revealed various themes such as how the topic of nonadherence is addressed, participants' responses to the patient's nonadherence, and the process of negotiating a new commitment to adherence. The case provides insight into the impact of contextual factors on the interaction and challenges involved in discussing nonadherence-in particular, the patient's attempts to save face, the pharmacy assistant's irritation and anger, and the patient's expressed regrets. This case raises questions around issues of patient agency. Health professionals are encouraged to consider the influence of context, lifeworld, and culture on patients' ability to adhere to treatment regimens. By working to improve communication processes and strengthen the therapeutic relationship, patients may be empowered to achieve better adherence levels."
9394,0.004,4.0,"Taken as prescribed, that is, with high adherence, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV infection and disease from being a sure predictor of death to a manageable chronic illness. Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
8125,0.004,4.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB), and HIV TB coinfection is associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to characterize patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in a reference centre for cases involving complications or drug resistance in TB. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%). Actions targeting the TB HIV-coinfected population, based on national and international recommendations, are necessary to improve prognosis and outcomes in TB and HIV infection in the institution."
5997,0.004,4.0,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."
9447,0.004,4.0,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
9387,0.004,4.0,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
9415,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is classified into subtypes on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences. Inter- and intra-subtype polymorphism extends throughout the genome, including the long terminal repeat (LTR). In this study, the importance of the upstream stimulating factor (USF)-binding site (E-box) in the core-negative regulatory element (NRE) of the LTR of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, E and G was investigated. In vivo, USF was found to repress transcription directed from representative HIV-1 LTR sequences of all the subtypes tested in an epithelial cell line, yet activate the same transcription in a T-cell line. Mutation of the core-NRE USF site of the representative subtype B LTR did not affect the cell-specific, subtype-independent, dual role of USF. In vitro binding assays showed that recombinant USF(43) interacts with the core-NRE from subtypes B and C, but not A, D, E or G. Thus, USF affects LTR-directed transcription in a cell-specific manner, independently of both the HIV-1 subtype from which the LTR was derived and the core-NRE USF site sequences."
9892,0.004,4.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with different genotypes and subgenotypes differ in response to treatment and long-term prognosis. The differences emerge from variability within the genomes that leads to structural deviations at the pregenomic level and to changes at the translational level. Naturally occurring HBV strains covering the four major genotypes A-D were obtained from 393 patients and part of the genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and analyzed for mutational differences in the precore and core promoter regions. The study confirmed that core promoter and precore mutations occur at key positions (A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A), and that the proportions of strains with seroconvertion in patients differ between the four HBV genotypes. A rare double mutation (C1857T together with G1897A) was observed, and C1856T was found together with the emerging G1898A mutation, which itself was found to be more widespread geographically than previously described. We found a novel mutation (T1850C), never before observed in human HBV strains but known from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A novel association of mutation C1773T with G1764T, C1766A, and G1757A was also found within a site already suggested to be a putative binding site for HNF-3. This novel association is proposed by us to be of importance for additional binding of HNH-2 to this site and is a better indicator of the emergence of the double mutation G1764T and C1766A than the G1757A mutation proposed previously."
3179,0.004,4.0,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."
6454,0.004,4.0,"The implementation of antiretroviral therapy demands the need for increased access to viral load (VL) monitoring. Newer real-time VL testing technologies are faster and have larger dynamic ranges and fully automated extraction to benefit higher throughputs in resource-poor environments. The Abbott RealTime human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assay was evaluated as a new option for testing for HIV-1 subtype C in South Africa, and its performance was compared to the performance of existing assays (the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1, version 1, assay; the AmpliPrep-Cobas Monitor standard HIV-1 assay; and the NucliSENS EasyQ-EasyMag HIV-1 assay) in a high-throughput laboratory. The total precision of the RealTime HIV-1 assay was acceptable over all viral load ranges. This assay compared most favorably with the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 assay (R(2) = 0.904), with a low standard deviation of difference being detected (0.323 copies/ml). The bias against comparator assays ranged from -0.001 copies/ml to -0.228 copies/ml. Variability in the reporting of VLs for a 20-member subtype panel compared to the variability of other assays was noted with subtypes G and CRF02-AG. The RealTime HIV-1 assay can test 93 samples per day with minimal manual preparation, less staff, and the minimization of contamination through automation. This assay is suitable for HIV-1 subtype C VL quantification in South Africa."
1434,0.004,4.0,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
7462,0.004,4.0,"The 1990 report of a cluster of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with a Florida dentist with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome attracted considerable media coverage and legislative attention. A number of polls found that the public favored mandatory HIV-antibody testing of health-care workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga, conducted a two-phase study to understand how public concerns regarding potential HIV transmission in health-care settings can be addressed by the medical and public health communities."
2010,0.004,4.0,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."

6268,0.004,4.0,"Nine black children aged between 3 months and 30 months of age, with human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) infection are described to draw the attention of health professionals in southern Africa to special clinical characteristics useful for recognising this problem, which has many shared features with common diseases of infancy and childhood in the Third World. The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6065,0.004,4.0,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."

10005,0.004,4.0,"North American mission boards (N = 82) with programs in sub-Saharan Africa were surveyed to identify practices affecting risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among international staff. Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."
5762,0.004,4.0,"The worldwide implementation of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) raised great hopes among policy makers and health organisations about the positive changes it would bring about in attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS, as well as for infected people's lives. A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "
4724,0.004,4.0,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
166,0.004,4.0,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the lungs of infected individuals are derived from proviral forms contemporaneously present in the peripheral blood or whether they evolve independently as an autonomous pool of viral quasispecies, HIV-1 envelope V3 domain structures at these sites were analyzed and compared. The V3 loop proviral nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences from lung bronchoalveolar lavage, where HIV-1 is primarily found in macrophages, were more homogeneous within individuals than those from unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where virus is predominantly in T cells. Comparison between individuals revealed that strains from bronchoalveolar lavage, but not from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, contained V3 domain nucleotide sequences with a great degree of homogeneity in the C-terminal region and a highly conserved, negatively charged amino acid motif. This V3 loop C-terminal structure could be important in the ability of HIV-1 to infect alveolar macrophages. Phylogenetic analyses of V3 domain nucleotide sequences in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage at both sites revealed the strains in lung macrophages to have evolved further from a presumed ancestral species than those in blood monocytes and to differ considerably in the inferred V3 loop amino acid structures. These results show that, as disease progression occurs, viral strains in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within the lung and blood microenvironments are not in a state of unrestricted bidirectional traffic but, instead, evolve independently."

This process may evolve with adverse clinical phenomena, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In the HIV population, non-tuberculous mycobacteria are a common cause of IRIS. However, only a few cases of Mycobacterium xenopi associated IRIS have been described. This paper concerns a case of M. xenopi pulmonary infection resulting in self-limited immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-1 infected patient."
5992,0.004,4.0,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
1865,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infects about two million people worldwide. HIV-2 has fewer treatment options than HIV-1, yet may evolve drug resistance more quickly. We have analysed several novel drugs for anti-HIV-2 activity. It was observed that 5-azacytidine, clofarabine, gemcitabine and resveratrol have potent anti-HIV-2 activity. The EC50 values for 5-azacytidine, clofarabine and resveratrol were found to be significantly lower with HIV-2 than with HIV-1. A time-of-addition assay was used to analyse the ability of these drugs to interfere with HIV-2 replication. Reverse transcription was the likely target for antiretroviral activity. Taken together, several novel drugs have been discovered to have activity against HIV-2. Based upon their known activities, these drugs may elicit enhanced HIV-2 mutagenesis and therefore be useful for inducing HIV-2 lethal mutagenesis. In addition, the data are consistent with HIV-2 reverse transcriptase being more sensitive than HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to dNTP pool alterations. "
4382,0.004,4.0,"We have been investigating a long-term nonprogressor who was found to be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive in 1985 and has survived with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (>1,000 CD4 cells/microl) without any AIDS-related illness. We have previously reported that repeated attempts to measure HIV-1 RNA in the peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from this subject have invariably failed. In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies infecting this patient by PCR amplification of two proviral regions, the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR)/gag leader and the nef gene, directly from fresh uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells, followed by length polymorphism analysis (with 1994, 1995, and 1996 samples) and sequencing (with a 1996 sample). Only proviral forms with nef deletions were revealed by length polymorphism analysis in samples from all three time points. Sequence analysis of the nef gene from the 1996 sample confirmed the presence of similar proviral quasispecies characterized by the presence of several deletions located in the nef-alone and the nef/U3 overlapping regions. Length polymorphism analysis of the 5'LTR/gag leader region suggested the existence of two major quasispecies populations, one characterized by the presence of forms carrying deletions in the U3 region and the other showing a completely intact, full-length 5'LTR. Evidence of the role of nef gene defects in long-term survival of HIV-1-infected patients has been provided so far in two independent investigations involving patients infected with HIV through blood transfusion. Here we show the existence of a similar condition in a subject who acquired HIV-1 seropositivity through the sexual route."

Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation.

Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.
2430,0.004,4.0,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
2509,0.004,4.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
5453,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."

This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."

Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively.

1553,0.004,4.0,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV) are common in patients with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). This is a cross-sectional study with patients infected with HIV/AIDS and active TB in Recife, Brazil, aiming to verify the prevalence of markers for HBV: antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc); and HCV: antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by chemiluminescence, and to identify the frequency of associated factors. Data were collected through questionnaires, and blood was drawn from patients for analysis. We used the chi-square test and the Fisher exact test when necessary. We conducted a bivariate logistic regression analysis and the magnitude of the associations was expressed as odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95%. Among 166 patients studied with HIV/AIDS and active TB, anti-HBc was positive in 61 patients [36.7%; 95%CI (29.4-44.6%)] and anti-HCV in 11[6.6%; 95%CI (3.4-11.5%)]. In the logistic regression analysis, male sex, and age ≥40 years were independent factors associated with the occurrence of anti-HBc. In conclusion, we verified a high frequency of HBV contact marker and a low frequency of HCV markers in patients with HIV/AIDS and TB in Recife."
8847,0.004,4.0,Recent studies have suggested that host genetics may be useful for predicting drug response and have supported the recommendation that single polynucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B should be investigated when treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1 infected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single IL-28B genotype SNP rs8099917 or rs12979860 determination is sufficient to predict treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV.
4469,0.004,4.0,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
3524,0.004,4.0,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
1501,0.004,4.0,"Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform."
9930,0.004,4.0,"Protection of older persons, particularly those with diabetes, against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is of growing concern because of increased reports of outbreaks among long-term care facility residents receiving assisted blood glucose monitoring. We evaluated hepatitis B vaccine immunogenicity among residents immunized in response to two such outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities during June 2009-July 2010. One hundred forty-eight (71%) of 209 residents were found to be susceptible to HBV infection. Of 105 patients who began a vaccination series with Twinrix(®) (0-, 1-, 6-month dosing), 86 (82%) completed the series and postvaccination testing. Of these, most were elderly (median age 79.5 years; range 45-101), female (56%), and African-American (51%). Twenty-nine (34%) vaccinated residents had post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody levels ≥10 mIU/ml. There were no significant differences in vaccine response by age, gender, race, diabetes status, body mass index, or current smoking status. Our findings indicate that a low proportion of skilled nursing facility residents achieved a seroprotective response after hepatitis B vaccination."
669,0.004,4.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection worldwide in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Intraabdominal TB includes lymphadenopathy and focal lesions of solid viscera. Symptomatic expression of tuberculous invasion of the pancreas (supplemented by demonstration of a mass on imaging) is rare among HIV-infected patients. We report the case of an HIV-infected patient with a tuberculous pancreatic abscess and review nine similar cases. All patients presented with persistent fever and abdominal pain. The diagnosis was made on the basis of detection of pancreatic mass lesions on computed tomographic (CT) scans and the results of cultures and/or acid-fast stains of peripancreatic abscess material and/or other body fluids. Despite an excellent response to antituberculous therapy, three patients died of unrelated causes. In the setting of a febrile illness with abdominal symptoms, tuberculous pancreatic abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis for HIV-infected patients with a CT-identified mass lesion."
9590,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) drug toxicities pose treatment challenges and contribute to poor adherence. This study was carried out to document the commonly reported adverse reactions caused by ARV drugs in HIV patients in Tanzania. Information on drug induced adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients using ARV drugs was collected from the databases maintained in HIV clinics of Dar es Salaam and Mbeya. A total of 7502 and 1234 records of patients under ARV therapy by December 2006 were analysed in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. In May, 2008 a cross-sectional study was conducted in which, the association between nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentrations and skin rashes problems was determined in 50 patients put on NVP based HAART for less than 2 weeks. Determination of NVP plasma concentration was carried out using a validated HPLC method in which patients from Dar es Salaam were involved. The study revealed that, anaemia, liver toxicity, skin rash and peripheral neuropathy were the most reported ADRs. The NVP plasma level determination revealed that there was no difference between those who had experienced skin rashes and those who did not (mean of 6.05 and 5.5 microg/ml respectively). There was a slight increase in reported ADRs between 2005 and 2006. A total of 932 (12.4%) patients changed their regimen in Dar es Salaam between January 2005 and December, 2006. Similarly, a total of 542 (44%) patients in Mbeya changed their regimen during that period. It can be concluded that, in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya patients developed ARV related ADRs which are similar to those reported elsewhere."
496,0.004,4.0,"Hospital charts were reviewed to ascertain the frequency with which patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were being managed in accordance with current guidelines or recommendations in New York State for the calendar year 1993. Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."
3183,0.004,4.0,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
4011,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
6689,0.004,4.0,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
4158,0.004,4.0,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."
7166,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study is to examine whether internalized AIDS stigma among HIV patients one year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, quality of life (QoL), and ARV adherence. This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
3741,0.004,4.0,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in cancer incidence, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, which arises from hepatocytes and accounts for approximately 70%-85% of cases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) frequently causes liver inflammation, hepatic damage and subsequent cirrhosis. Integrated viral DNA is found in 85%-90% of HBV-related HCCs. Its presence in tumors from non-cirrhotic livers of children or young adults further supports the role of viral DNA integration in hepatocarcinogenesis. Integration of subgenomic HBV DNA fragments into different locations within the host DNA is a significant feature of chronic HBV infection. Integration has two potential consequences: (1) the host genome becomes altered (""cis"" effect); and (2) the HBV genome becomes altered (""trans"" effect). The cis effect includes insertional mutagenesis, which can potentially disrupt host gene function or alter host gene regulation. Tumor progression is frequently associated with rearrangement and partial gain or loss of both viral and host sequences. However, the role of integrated HBV DNA in hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial. Modern technology has provided a new paradigm to further our understanding of disease mechanisms. This review summarizes the role of HBV DNA integration in human carcinogenesis."
4921,0.004,4.0,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."
1560,0.004,4.0,"Clinically significant methemoglobinemia can develop as a result of medications. Although dapsone and primaquine are known to produce methemoglobinemia in susceptible individuals, methemoglobinemia has been reported only rarely in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. We describe five cases of methemoglobinemia caused by either primaquine or dapsone alone or in combination. The initial methemoglobin level ranged from 15.3% in the patient whose methemoglobinemia was caused by primaquine alone to 33.1%. Five patients developed symptomatic methemoglobinemia requiring hospitalization for 1 to 12 days. Two cases resulted from intentional overdoses of dapsone, and three developed within several days of commencing primaquine while dapsone remained present in the bloodstream. The four severe cases required intravenous methylene blue, supplemental oxygen, plus erythrocyte transfusions, whereas the mild case responded to oxygen therapy plus discontinuation of the precipitating drugs. Blood gases and pulse oximetry do not aid in the diagnosis, which requires cooximetry. Our study indicates that dapsone and primaquine alone or in combination can produce clinically significant methemoglobinemia in HIV-infected individuals, either in the setting of an overdose or when primaquine is instituted before dapsone has been cleared from the bloodstream."
5703,0.004,4.0,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
1622,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific, and particularly Asia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic, the most common route of transmission is perinatal. To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."
464,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."

Between 1985, when most patients were tested for HIV infection, and 1993 3 possibly HIV-related suicides were reported to Haemophilia Centre Directors. It is argued that haemophilia comprehensive care may contribute to reducing some of the factors associated with suicide risk, and thus be a reason for this low incidence. It is suggested that the pattern of health care delivery developed for the haemophilia community might serve as a template for those treating others with HIV infection."
9867,0.004,4.0,"Medicaid is rapidly moving toward managed care throughout the United States and will have a major impact on care programs for those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The experience at the Johns Hopkins HIV Care Service is an example of the transition from fee-for-service to managed care. The Maryland Medicaid program, which has required enrollment of all Medicaid recipients since June 1997, uses an adjusted payment rate and separately funds protease inhibitors. Elements that made the transition to a managed care organization possible included the early development of a comprehensive network of services and a database showing that historical Medicaid payments were low compared with the statewide experience. Our Medicaid managed care program promotes unlimited access to specialists, rejects the ""gatekeeper"" concept for any service, and includes an open formulary. Nevertheless, it is uncertain that the services now provided can be sustained with anticipated reductions in payments that seem inevitable with Medicaid policies here and nationally."
4758,0.004,4.0,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
7791,0.004,4.0,"Depletion of CD4+ T cells is one of the hallmarks of progression of HIV-1 infection. However, measurement of the CD4+ T-cell count is expensive and often unavailable in less developed areas. Previous studies have suggested that the total lymphocyte count (TLC) can be used to predict a low absolute CD4+ T-cell count. To determine the relationship between TLC and CD4+ T-cell count in HIV-1-infected South African patients, 2777 HIV-1-seropositive patients visiting the Immunology clinic at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from April 1991 to April 1997 were included in the study. In total, 3237 observations were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, of various cutpoints of the TLC to predict an absolute CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, CD4+ percentage <20%, and CD4+ percentage <15%. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between TLC and CD4+ T cells, CD4+ percentage and CD8+ T cells, as well as between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results demonstrated that a TLC of 2 x 10(9)/L or less had a sensitivity of 90.3% to detect patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, but a specificity of only 53.7%. When the TLC cutoff value was lowered, specificity increased but sensitivity decreased. For the observations as a group, a correlation (r = 0.704) between CD4+ T-cell count and TLC was demonstrated, but if the patients were divided into three groups according to their CD4+ T-cell count, this correlation weakened considerably. Therefore, although TLC shows a correlation with CD4+ T-cell count, it is not a good predictor of the CD4+ T-cell count in this population and should preferably not be used in the clinical care of HIV/AIDS patients."
1888,0.004,4.0,"The regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and replication in primary monocytes was investigated by mutagenesis of recombinant proviral clones containing an env determinant required for the infectivity of monocytes. Virus replication was assayed by determination of reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids and by recovery of virus from monocytes following cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, silent infection, and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or vpu genes generated lower replication levels in monocytes. Mutation of both vpr and vpu, however, resulted in nearly complete attenuation of virus replication in monocytes, despite subsequent virus recovery from infected monocytes by cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (silent infection). These findings indicate a central role for the ""accessory"" genes vpu and vpr in productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in monocytes and indicate that vpu and vpr may be capable of functional complementation."
71,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is currently about 35% among injecting drug users in Budapest, Hungary, and it is under 20% outside of the capital, and no verified case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been detected so far. Mathematical models describe that the co-occurrence of HIV and HCV among injecting drug users is such under an HCV prevalence of about 35% the probability of an HIV epidemic is low, but above this threshold an, HIV epidemic is to be expected. According to these models, there is a looming probability of an HIV epidemic among injecting drug users in Hungary, especially in Budapest. There are four ways to prevent or delay such an epidemic: 1. substitution treatment programs; 2. legal access to injecting equipment; 3. free and confidential HIV and HCV counseling and rapid testing; and 4. hygienic injecting environment. In order to avoid a predicted HIV epidemic, epidemiological pattern of HCV among injecting drug users in Hungary requires both a comprehensive prevention response and the systematic monitoring of the epidemiological situation. The success of the prevention programs depends on two factors: 1. wide access; and 2. regular financial support from the government."
8860,0.004,4.0,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
4258,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study performed in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, was to describe the distribution of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes (CD4) in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) pregnant women diagnosed during prenatal voluntary counseling and testing and to assess whether HIV-related immunodeficiency influenced the acceptance of an antiretroviral (ARV) package (zidovudine beginning at 36 weeks of amenorrhea plus intrapartum nevirapine) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Between April and June 2002, a CD4 count was systematically performed in all HIV+ women (n=221) in 5 antenatal clinics carrying out voluntary counseling and testing. No difference in CD4 count was found in HIV+ women who did not return for their test result (n=50) and those who were informed of their positive serostatus (n=171) (median CD4 count: 389/mm3 vs. 420/mm3; P=0.19). We also found a lack of difference in CD4 count in those who accepted ARV (n=72) and those who did not but knew their HIV status (n=99) (median CD4 count: 405/mm3 vs. 425/mm3; P=0.47). The overall uptake of the intervention (31.9%) appeared to be independent of the maternal immune status."
1793,0.004,4.0,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."

Major problems facing surgeons will be how and when to provide appropriate care for AIDS patients, and protection of themselves and all health care personnel from occupational infection by the highly lethal HIV. Strict adherence to guidelines to prevent such occupational infection is paramount, and these should be observed in all patients, since it is impossible to always identify patients who are infectious. A sound understanding of the clinical problem and attention to this evolving epidemic are also essential for surgeons and all other health care personnel. With respect to society in general, control of AIDS and HIV can only be achieved by a joint effort of education, individual responsibility, and a coordinated governmental commitment to the problem."

9989,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
6574,0.004,4.0,"HIV and poor mental health are intricately related. In settings of poverty, both are often rooted in structural factors related to material and social deprivation. We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation."
6473,0.004,4.0,"Starting from the observation that a number of consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) resulted positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies on routine testing, we set up a survey for HCV contact prevalence in all patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) followed in our institution. We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
7032,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog-based regimens remain an integral component of combination therapy for use in both antiretroviral treatment-naive and experienced HIV-infected patients. To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovudine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continuation of ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3TC to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV + 3TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sustained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD4+ cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (+36, +28 versus -4 cells/mm3; p = 0.012) and long-term CD4+ cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40/48: +32, +19 versus -9 cells/mm3; p = 0.003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p < 0.001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0.53 log10 and 0.54 log10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0.13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p = 0.30). At week 48, no differences were observed in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18% of subjects in each treatment arm (3-way p = 1.0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3%) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activity of 3TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug. The current approach of using 3TC in maximally suppressive regimens is preferred."

GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
6790,0.004,4.0,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
9217,0.004,4.0,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."
9344,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine, remain the cornerstone of therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS. Although therapeutic regimens have been designed that are effective in slowing the progression of disease, therapy with these agents has not been optimized. Ultimately, therapy is destined to fail in most patients. Decisions regarding when to begin therapy and the course of action to take when failure of therapy occurs are largely in the hands of the patient's physician, and currently must be made without the support of conclusive clinical data. In addition to an understanding of the recommended dosing guidelines, proper management of AIDS therapy requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease process, the pharmacology and limitations of the agents employed against the virus, and close cooperation with the clinical laboratory. Therefore, this article reviews the pharmacology of the three drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV infection, and the current guidelines for their use. The article also reviews the clinical and laboratory management of these agents, including the use of surrogate markers and the potential for pharmacokinetic optimization of therapy."
3335,0.004,4.0,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
7793,0.004,4.0,"Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend early initiation of HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of their clinical or immunological status known as the test and start approach. Lesotho, like many other countries introduced this approach in 2016 as a strategy to reach epidemic control. There will be rapidly growing number of HIV-infected individuals initiating treatment leading to practical challenges on health systems such as congestion, long waiting time for patients and limited time to provide quality services to patients. Differentiated models of ART delivery is an innovative solution that helps to increase access to care, while reducing the burden on existing health systems. Ultimately this model will help to achieve retention and viral suppression. We describe a demonstration study designed to evaluate a community-based differentiated model of multi-month dispensing (MMD) approaches of ART among stable HIV patients in Lesotho."
7711,0.004,4.0,"The Early Intervention Program (EIP) is California's publicly funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and treatment program with 30 sites throughout the state. Our objective for this study was to examine the number of days from first HIV-positive result until enrollment into EIP by race/ethnicity, behavioral risk, and other characteristics, with data from clients who enrolled in an EIP site after the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies. For Model I, logistic regression distinguished clients diagnosed with HIV and enrolled in EIP on the same day (0 days) from those with values of 1+ days; linear regression was then used on the log transformation of days for the majority of clients not diagnosed and enrolled on the same day. For Model II, logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics related to enrollment in EIP over 6 weeks from the date of HIV diagnosis. We found that Latinos were more likely than whites to enroll in EIP on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. For clients not diagnosed and enrolled in EIP on the same day, no differences across racial and ethnic groups were found for days until enrollment in HIV care and treatment. However, clients with a history of injection drug use took longer from the day they were diagnosed with HIV to enroll in EIP. The California EIP represents a model for programs seeking equity in access to HIV care and treatment across racial and ethnic groups. Getting injectors into timely HIV care and treatment represents a challenge."
3529,0.004,4.0,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."
8478,0.004,4.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
274,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat, a nuclear transactivator of viral gene expression, has the unusual property of being released by infected cells. Recent studies suggest that extracellular Tat is partially sequestered by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. As a consequence, Tat is concentrated on the cell surface and protected from proteolytic degradation, thus remaining in a biologically active form. We show that Tat binds the surfaces of both HIV-1-infected and surrounding uninfected cells. We provide evidence for a specific interaction between Tat and the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) envelope protein, which enhances virus attachment and entry into cells. We map the interacting sites of both Tat and gp120 and show that synthetic peptides mimicking the gp120 site inhibit HIV-1 infection. Our data demonstrate that membrane-associated Tat is a novel modulator of virus entry and suggest that the Tat-gp120 interaction represents a critical step in HIV-1 spreading during the course of infection."

2608,0.004,4.0,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."

We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."

Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."

Liver function tests and viral markers were monitored monthly. Liver biopsy was requested whenever the alanine transaminase (ALT) was persistently abnormal. Eighty-six HBV carriers who were not given anti-TB drugs were chosen as a second control and evaluated prospectively. The incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV carriers given anti-TB drugs (34.9%) when compared to noncarriers (9.4%, P <.001) and with HBV carriers not given anti-TB drugs (8.1%, P <.001). For patients given anti-TB drugs, HBV carriers who developed liver dysfunction were younger (P =.011) and had more severe liver injury compared with noncarriers (P =.008). By multiple logistic regression analysis, age (P =.002) and hepatitis B infection (P <.001) were the only 2 significant risk factors for hepatotoxicity related to anti-TB therapy."
335,0.004,4.0,"Since the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for HIV infection, there have been increasing reports of systemic manifestations of immune restoration. This new clinical syndrome among HIV-infected patients is associated with underlying co-infections with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C infections, etc.... We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment. She developed fever, large abscesses and pleural and peritoneal effusions. Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
1312,0.004,4.0,"As health-care services in Nigeria and other African countries are becoming overstrained with patients, home-based care has increasingly been touted as a possible solution. The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."
6204,0.004,4.0,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
119,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

531,0.004,4.0,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
8310,0.004,4.0,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
1187,0.004,4.0,"Patients with hepatitis C virus-related decompensated cirrhosis can benefit from interferon-based antiviral therapy, but the common complication of cytopenia is a contraindication for this treatment. Splenectomy prior to interferon therapy may alleviate this problem. To investigate whether splenectomy improves the efficacy of antiviral therapy, 13 interferon-naïve hepatitis C virus decompensated cirrhotic patients underwent splenectomy between January 2008 and January 2011, followed 1-3 months later by an interferon-based therapeutic regimen (pegylated/standard interferon-α combined with ribavirin for 48 weeks). Ten (76.9%) of the patients developed postoperative complications, which included minor portal vein thrombosis (2/13, 15.4%) and transient ascites (8/13, 61.5%). At one-month post-splenectomy, the patients showed significantly increased platelet (pre-surgery: 48.2±15.9 vs. 186.0±70.6×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) and leukocyte (2.1±0.5 vs. 5.7±1.4×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) counts. Eight (61.5%) of the patients achieved sustained virological response, including all HCV genotype 2a-infected patients (4/4, 100%) and some of the genotype 1b-infected patients (4/9, 44.4%). Temporary interferon-α suspension was required for one patient to address severe intestinal infection. These results indicate that splenectomy prior to interferon-based therapy was safe and may facilitate adherence to subsequent antiviral therapy in selected HCV cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism.

2810,0.004,4.0,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."
992,0.004,4.0,"Although smoking is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, in resource-constrained, high HIV prevalence settings, information on smoking cessation intent and acceptability is limited. Of 150 self-reported current smokers surveyed in two South African HIV clinics, 62 (42%) reported intent to quit smoking in the next year, while 86 (58%) were not interested in quitting or had no plan to quit; 132 (82%) had attempted to quit at least once in the past. Respondents' preferred cessation strategies were counseling and nicotine replacement. A high proportion of HIV-infected smokers want to quit, and interventions should be provided as part of HIV care."
7875,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T-cell responses targeting products encoded within the Gag open reading frame have frequently been associated with better viral control and disease outcome during the chronic phase of HIV infection. To further clarify this relationship, we have studied the dynamics of Gag-specific CD8 T-cell responses in relation to plasma viral load and time since infection in 33 chronically infected subjects over a 9-month period. High baseline viral loads were associated with a net loss of breadth (P < 0.001) and a decrease in the total magnitude of the Gag-specific T-cell response in general (P = 0.03). Most importantly, the baseline viral load predicted the subsequent change in the breadth of Gag recognition over time (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.41). Compared to maintained responses, lost responses were low in magnitude (P < 0.0001) and subdominant in the hierarchy of Gag-specific responses. The present study indicates that chronic exposure of the human immune system to high levels of HIV viremia is a determinant of virus-specific CD8 T-cell loss."
6663,0.004,4.0,"In the United States, of the 1.1 million persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the 2.7 million infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), approximately 16% and 50%, respectively, are unaware of their infection. Highly effective treatments have turned both diseases into manageable conditions, and in the case of hepatitis C, a disease that can be cured. Early diagnosis is imperative so that infected persons can take measures to stay healthy, get into care, benefit from therapy, and reduce the risk of transmission. In this report, we review current recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force on whom to screen for HIV and HCV infections, and recommendations from the CDC, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute on how to test for these infections.

4856,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."
