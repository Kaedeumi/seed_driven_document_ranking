4048,0.015,15.0,"The government of Zimbabwe began providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in public institutions in 2004. In Midlands province two clinics constituted the most active HIV care service points, with patients being followed up through a comprehensive patient monitoring and tracking system which captured specific patient variables and outcomes over time. The data from 2006 to 2011 were subjected to analysis to answer specific research questions and this case study is based on that analysis. The goal of this case study is to build participants' capacity to undertake secondary data analysis and interpretation using a dataset for HIV antiretroviral therapy in Zimbabwe and to draw conclusions which inform recommendations. Case studies in applied epidemiology allow students to practice applying epidemiologic skills in the classroom to address real-world public health problems. Case studies as a vital component of an applied epidemiology curriculum are instrumental in reinforcing principles and skills covered in lectures or in background reading. The target audience includes Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs), university students, district health executives, and health information officers."
8438,0.014,14.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy era, medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) have become critical issues for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). The purpose of this study was to test explanatory models of how patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction are related to medication adherence and HRQOL for PLWH. A total of 344 PLWH receiving health-care services from a federally funded clinic in the southwest USA completed a survey questionnaire about their perception of interactions with providers, their satisfaction with services, their medication adherence, and their HRQOL. Comparing four latent variable structural equation models of direct and mediated effects of patient-provider interaction and patient satisfaction, the findings illustrate that the best model is one in which patient-provider interaction has a direct and positive effect on patient satisfaction, medication adherence, and HRQOL. These findings suggest that quality patient-provider interaction is a critical element of health-care services for PLWH, while patient satisfaction is an outcome measure and not a mediating factor for medication adherence and HRQOL.

5673,0.013,13.0,"Initiation of efavirenz-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with Vitamin D deficiency, but the risk factors including efavirenz pharmacokinetics for cART-induced severe vitamin D deficiency (SVDD) and the impact of anti-tuberculosis (TB) cotreatment are not explored. We investigated the prevalence of SVDD in HIV and TB-HIV coinfected patients and associated risk factors for treatment-induced SVDD.Treatment-naïve Ethiopian HIV patients with (n = 102) or without (n = 89) TB co-infection were enrolled prospectively and received efavirenz-based cART. In TB-HIV coinfected patients, rifampicin-based anti-TB treatment was initiated 4 or 8 weeks before starting cART. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D), cholesterol and 4-beta hydroxycholesterol concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, 16, and 48 week of cART. Plasma efavirenz concentrations were determined at 4 and 16 weeks of cART.TB-HIV patients had significantly lower plasma 25 (OH)D3 levels than HIV-only patients at baseline. TB co-infection, low Karnofsky score, high viral load, and high CYP3A activity as measured by plasma 4β-hydroxycholesterol/cholesterol ratios were significant predictors of low 25 (OH)D3 levels at baseline. In HIV-only patients, initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVVD from 27% at baseline to 76%, 79%, and 43% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively. The median 25 (OH)D3 levels declined from baseline by -40%, -50%, and -14% at 4, 16, and 48 weeks of cART, respectively.In TB-HIV patients, previous anti-TB therapy had no influence on 25 (OH)D3 levels, but the initiation of efavirenz-based cART increased the prevalence of SVDD from 57% at baseline to 70% and 72% at the 4 and 16 weeks of cART, respectively. Median plasma 25 (OH)D3 declined from baseline by -17% and -21% at week 4 and 16 of cART, respectively.Our results indicate low plasma cholesterol, high CYP3A activity, and high plasma efavirenz concentrations as significant predictors of early efavirenz-based cART-induced vitamin D deficiency. Low plasma 25 (OH)D3 level at baseline is associated with TB co-infection and HIV diseases progression. Initiation of efavirenz-based cART is associated with high incidence of SVDD, whereas rifampicin based anti-TB therapy co-treatment has no significant effect. Supplementary vitamin D during cART initiation may be beneficial for HIV patients regardless of TB coinfection. "
5402,0.012,12.0,"Routine military screening identified human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in an asymptomatic dentist who had three prior negative antibody tests. A look-back investigation evaluated the provider and the practice and provided notification, counseling, and HIV testing for patients. Test results were linked to dental procedures categorized by levels of invasiveness. Of 1631 patients tested, all were negative for antibody to HIV. Analysis of 12,164 procedures on 876 patients determined 20.5% of patients had procedures from the highest stratum of invasiveness; 42% had only low-risk exposure. Stratification of the degree of invasive exposure and clinical evaluation of disease stage in the infected health care worker are important in look-back investigations. The early stage of disease in the provider, the adherence to infection control precautions, and the low percentage of invasive procedures may have contributed to the lack of transmission. These results are consistent with current assessment that risk of transmission of HIV during invasive medical procedures is low."
4248,0.012,12.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) usually have an unfavorable clinical outcome in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. In Egypt, data about epidemiology, the spectrum of disease, and impact of HDV on HBV infection are rare. To assess the prevalence, clinical and virological characteristics of HDV infection among Egyptian patients with chronic HBV. Adult patients with Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive were evaluated for the presence of HDV using anti HDV-IgG and HDV RNA by RT-PCR. Routine laboratory investigations, genotypes and subtypes for both HBV and HDV, abdominal sonography, and transient elastography (TE) were done. Liver biopsy was performed only in whenever indicated. One hundred and twenty-one treatment-naïve chronic HBV patients were included. Wild HBV genotype-D2 was found in 98.2% and 81.9% were HBeAg negative. Prevalence of HDV was 8.3% by anti-HDV IgG and 9.9% by RT-PCR. Wild HDV genotype-IIb was reported in 83.3%. HDV infection was more common in males, 90.9% of delta patients were HBeAg negative. Compared to the mono-infected HBV, concomitant HBV/HDV infection was not associated with more derangment in ALT nor advanced stage of fibrosis. 66.7% of HDV patients had significantly lower HBV-DNA level compared to the non-delta patients (P < 0.001). HDV is not uncommon in Egypt. HBV genotype-D was associated with HDV genotype-IIb. Delta infection was associated with negative HBeAg status, reduction of HBV replication, but neither influenced the clinical course nor increased significant liver damage risk."
9923,0.012,12.0,"The recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in middle/low-income countries has been associated with increasing prevalence of HIV pre-ART drug resistance (PDR). We assessed PDR prevalence, patterns, and trends in Guatemala. Blood samples from 1,084 ART-naive individuals, enrolled from October 2010 to December 2013 at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City, were obtained. PDR was evaluated using the WHO mutation list for transmitted drug resistance (TDR) surveillance. An overall PDR prevalence of 7.3% (95% CI 5.8-9.0%) was observed for the whole study period. TDR to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) was the highest (4.9%, p<0.001), followed by nucleoside RT inhibitors (1.8%) and protease inhibitors (1.0%). No significant trends in PDR prevalence were observed during the study period. However, higher NNRTI PDR levels were found in individuals with >500 and 350-500 CD4(+) T cells/μl (7.4% and 8.7%, respectively) compared to individuals with <350 CD4(+) T cells/μl (3.7%; p=0.039 and p=0.007, respectively), as well as a tendency of higher levels of NNRTI transmitted drug resistance (DR) in individuals with recent infection determined by HIV incidence tests (9.7%), suggesting increasing trends in time. Clusters of viruses with NNRTI PDR suggesting complex transmission networks were observed. No associations between PDR and demographic variables were found. PDR in Guatemala remains at an intermediate level. Nevertheless, we have shown evidence suggesting increasing trends in NNRTI PDR, which need to be taken into account in national HIV management policies."
4563,0.012,12.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection alters the epidemiology of mycobacterial infections. In the industrialised world, this has led to an increase in severe illness associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and, in the developing world, to doubling of tuberculosis cases in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The interaction with Mycobacterium tuberculosis occurs when the CD4 count is relatively high (> 200) and tuberculosis (TB) is now the commonest presenting AIDS defining disease in Africa. In international public health terms the interaction between TB and HIV infection has led to the World Health Organisation declaring TB to be a global emergency. Both TB and HIV are diseases of poverty and the key to the reduction of incidence of both diseases is the improvement of socio-economic conditions. Other control methods are case finding and treatment, chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination. Finding active (sputum positive) case of tuberculosis and treating them is the function of TB control programmes in all countries, but poor adherence to medication has lead to low cure rates and increasing development of drug resistance. Resources are needed to improve adherence to medication and for research to improve diagnostic methods and treatment."
8267,0.012,12.0,"It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that efforts to optimize nutritional status through individualized medical nutrition therapy, assurance of food and nutrition security, and nutrition education are essential to the total system of health care available to people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection throughout the continuum of care. Broad-based efforts to improve health care access and treatment have stabilized HIV prevalence levels in many parts of the world and led to longer survival for people living with HIV infection. Confounding clinical and social issues, such as medication interactions, comorbidities, wasting, lipodystrophy, food insecurity, aging, and other related conditions further complicate disease management. With greater understanding of the mechanisms of HIV disease and its impact on body function, development of new treatments, and wider ranges of populations affected, the management of chronic HIV infection continues to become more complex and demanding. Achievement of food and nutrition security and management of nutrition-related complications of HIV infection remain significant challenges for clients with HIV infection and health care professionals. Registered dietitians and dietetic technicians, registered, should integrate their efforts into the overall health care strategies to optimize their clinical and social influence for people living with HIV infection."
6463,0.011,11.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral therapies potentially suppress HBV viral load to an undetectable level reducing the risk of progressive liver disease and the development of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Adherence to antiviral therapies is imperative to achieve and maintain viral suppression. To date, there has been limited research on adherence to HBV therapies. Our study aimed to explore factors influencing adherence to antiviral therapy. A total of 29 participants consented to in-depth qualitative interviews at three outpatient clinics in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were initially classified as adherent or nonadherent and thematic analysis was used to identify dominant themes. Adherent behavior was reported by 59% (n = 17) of participants. Several themes influenced adherence including routine, fear of HBV-related disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, and forgetfulness. To our knowledge, this is the first qualitative study to explore adherence to HBV antiviral therapy. An interplay of several dominant themes emerged from our data including fear of chronic HBV disease progression, clinician-patient communication, treatment knowledge, routine, and forgetfulness. Study findings have the potential to change nursing clinical practice, especially the way nurses and other clinicians target key HBV treatment messages and education, while monitoring adherence."
3236,0.011,11.0,"The value of CD4 lymphocyte counts as a surrogate marker in persons with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection during antiretroviral treatment was assessed using longitudinal models and data from the Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS didanosine/zalcitabine trial of 467 HIV-infected patients. Patients with AIDS or two CD4 counts of < or = 300 who fulfilled specific criteria for zidovudine intolerance or failure were randomized to receive either 500 mg didanosine (ddl) daily or 2.25 mg zalcitabine (ddC) per day. Absolute CD4 counts were recorded at study entry and at as many as four visits. Patients were followed for clinical disease progression and survival. At 2 months, the difference in mean CD4 count from baseline was +15.4 cells/mm3 in the ddI group but -1.3 cells/mm3 in the ddC group. Patients assigned to ddI had a greater chance of a CD4 response at 2 months than those on ddC, yet only those in the ddC group with a response showed significant improvement in progression of disease or survival compared with ddC nonresponders, ddI responders, and ddI nonresponders (p = 0.03). We conclude that a CD4 response does not necessarily correlate with improved outcome and is therefore not a useful surrogate marker in these patients."
6768,0.01,10.0,"Cases of tuberculosis identified during 1992-1994 through an active tuberculosis surveillance network among six hospitals that serve New York City (the TBNetwork) were analyzed according to the occupational status of the patients. Clinical data were obtained by review of medical records, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates was performed. No known nosocomial outbreaks of tuberculosis occurred at these hospitals in the study period. Occupational status was known for 142 of 201 patients whose isolates were available for strain typing. Patients infected by organisms with a clustered strain typing pattern, as determined by RFLP analysis, were presumed to have recently acquired disease. RFLP typing revealed that isolates from 13 (65%) of 20 health care workers and 50 (41%) of 122 non-health care workers had a clustered RFLP pattern. The strains infecting eight (89%) of nine health care workers seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had a clustered RFLP pattern. Multivariate analysis of 75 patients with known HIV and occupational status revealed that HIV status (P = .03) and health care worker status (P = .02; RR = 2.77) were independent risk factors for a clustered RFLP strain. These findings suggest that many of the apparently sporadic cases of tuberculosis among health care workers may be due to unrecognized occupational transmission."
2359,0.01,10.0,"There is growing international concern that food insecurity may negatively impact antiretroviral (ARV) treatment outcomes, but no studies have directly evaluated the effect of food insecurity on viral load suppression and antiretroviral adherence. We hypothesized that food insecurity would be associated with poor virologic response among homeless and marginally housed HIV-positive ARV-treated patients."
355,0.01,10.0,"HIV increases the risk of liver disease as do two common coinfections, hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV). However, whether combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reverses or exacerbates hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.This was an observational retrospective study. cART-naïve HIV-infected subjects without a history of substance abuse (including alcohol) had liver disease stage determined by aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio indices (APRIs) and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) before and 24 and 48 weeks after cART. All the data were retrieved from previously established cohorts. Values before and after cART were compared using Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with moderate-to-severe liver disease.Of the 1105 HIV-infected subjects, 120 were HBV coinfected and 64 were HCV coinfected. About 20% of HIV monoinfected participants had APRI and FIB-4 scores consistent with moderate-to-significant fibrosis compared to ∼36% of HIV-HBV coinfected and 67% to 77% of HIV-HCV coinfected participants. In adjusted analyses compared with HIV monoinfection, HBV coinfection was associated with 1.18-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.12-fold higher FIB-4 (P = 0.007) prior to cART; while HCV coinfection was associated with 1.94-fold higher APRI (P < 0.001) and a 1.43-fold higher FIB-4 (P < 0.001). After 48 weeks of cART, both fibrosis scores decreased in all subjects; however, HCV coinfection was still associated with higher fibrosis scores at week 48 compared to HIV monoinfection.cART was associated with improvement in hepatic fibrosis scores in the majority of HIV-hepatitis coinfected and HIV-monoinfected Chinese participants."
6369,0.01,10.0,"As of October 2006, 6 medications are approved in the United States for the management of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection: 2 formulations of interferon and 4 oral nucleos(t)ide analogues. For the treating practitioner, tailoring the pharmaceutical regimen according to patient features and clinical circumstances can be a challenge. First-line therapeutic regimens for the management of HBV infection include monotherapy with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent that has potent on-treatment viral response and low rates of resistance; in the future, these regimens may include a combination of more than one nucleos(t)ide analogue or a combination of a nucleos(t)ide analogue and pegylated interferon. The oral nucleos(t)ide analogues are generally better tolerated than interferon; however, they can be expensive when administered for lengthy periods and can also lead to medication resistance. Lamivudine, the first approved nucleoside analogue for the treatment of HBV infection, has a very high resistance profile; in fact, lamivudine exposure increases viral resistance to other commercially available nucleos(t)ide analogues: entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir. For these reasons, the 2007 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines no longer recommend lamivudine as first-line therapy for the management of HBV infection. A satellite symposium conducted during the 57th Annual Meeting of the AASLD in Boston, Massachusetts, presented approaches to customizing the management of chronic HBV infection. The presentation highlighted recent findings suggesting that early, profound, and sustained viral suppression improves the probability of sustained virologic response and reduces the likelihood of nucleos(t)ide resistance."
9178,0.01,10.0,"This study aimed to determine the prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium among HIV/AIDS patients in southwest of Iran. Two hundred fifty faecal samples from HIV patients were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts using a conventional coproscopic approach. Such oocysts were detected in 18 (7.2%) out of 250 faecal samples. Genomic DNAs from 250 samples were then subjected to a nested-PCR-RFLP technique targeting different loci of 18S rRNA gene for species identification. Out of 250 samples, 27 (10.8%) were positive for different Cryptosporidium spp; Restriction patterns resulting from the digestion of the nested amplicon with restriction endonucleases VspI and SspI showed that C. parvum (70.38%) was the most prevalent species, followed by C. hominis (25.92%) and C. meleagridis (3.7%), respectively. The mean CD4+ T-cell count was 215 cells/μL. There was a strong association between cryptosporidiosis and CD4+ T-cell count (P = 0.000) with the highest prevalence recorded among patients with CD4+ T-cell count < 200 cells/μL. This confirms that there is a low opportunity for this parasite to get established as the patients CD4+ T-cell count increases. Also HIV infection increased the risk of having Cryptosporidium. Our epidemiological findings are useful for any preventive intervention to control disease diffusion."
8417,0.01,10.0,"HIV-positive refugees confront a variety of challenges in accessing and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attaining durable viral suppression; however, there is little understanding of what these challenges are, how they are navigated, or how they may differ across humanitarian settings. We sought to document and examine accounts of the threats, barriers and facilitators experienced in relation to HIV treatment and care and to conduct comparisons across settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews among a purposive sample of 14 refugees attending a public, urban HIV clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (July-September 2010), and 12 refugees attending a camp-based HIV clinic in Kakuma, Kenya (February-March 2011). We used framework methods and between-case comparison to analyze and interpret the data, identifying social and environmental factors that influenced adherence. The multiple issues that threatened adherence to antiretroviral therapy or precipitated actual adherence lapses clustered into three themes: ""migration"", ""insecurity"", and ""resilience"". The migration theme included issues related to crossing borders and integrating into treatment systems upon arrival in a host country. Challenges related to crossing borders were reported in both settings, but threats pertaining to integration into, and navigation of, a new health system were exclusive to the Malaysian setting. The insecurity theme included food insecurity, which was most commonly reported in the Kenyan setting; health systems insecurity, reported in both settings; and emotional insecurity, which was most common in the Kenyan setting. Resilient processes were reported in both settings. We drew on the concept of ""bounded agency"" to argue that, despite evidence of personal and community resilience, these processes were sometimes insufficient for overcoming social and environmental barriers to adherence. In general, interventions might aim to bolster individuals' range of action with targeted support that bolsters resilient processes. Specific interventions are needed to address locally-based food and health system insecurities. "
6073,0.01,10.0,"Immune mechanisms that may control Cryptosporidium parvum infection remain unknown. The role of T cell-mediated immunity is suggested by the chronic disease observed in AIDS patients and in athymic or CD4+ T cell-depleted mice. The role of specific antibodies is also unclear. This study sought to determine serum and secretory antibodies to C. parvum in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with or without chronic cryptosporidiosis. C. parvum-specific antibodies and specific secretory antibodies were determined by ELISA in saliva and sera from 50 HIV-1-infected patients, 27 healthy adults, and 21 healthy children. Despite lower CD4+ lymphocyte counts, patients with chronic cryptosporidiosis had increased levels of C. parvum-specific antibodies in saliva and serum and higher specific secretory antibody levels in saliva than did controls. Persistence of protracted diarrhea despite high levels of both serum and secretory antibodies suggests that specific secretory antibodies are not sufficient to control this protozoan parasite infection of intestinal mucosa."
1917,0.01,10.0,"HIV-seropositive, active injection-drug users (IDUs), compared with other HIV populations, continue to have low rates of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use, contributing to disparities in their HIV health outcomes. We sought to identify individual-level, interpersonal, and structural factors associated with HAART use among active IDUs to inform comprehensive, contextually tailored intervention to improve the HAART use of IDUs. Prospective data from three semiannual assessments were combined, and logistic general estimating equations were used to identify variables associated with taking HAART 6 months later. Participants were a community sample of HIV-seropositive, active IDUs enrolled in the INSPIRE study, a U.S. multisite (Baltimore, Miami, New York, San Francisco) prevention intervention. The analytic sample included 1,225 observations, and comprised 62% males, 75% active drug users, 75% non-Hispanic blacks, and 55% with a CD4 count <350; 48% reported HAART use. Adjusted analyses indicated that the later HAART use of IDUs was independently predicted by patient-provider engagement, stable housing, medical coverage, and more HIV primary care visits. Significant individual factors included not currently using drugs and a positive attitude about HAART benefits even if using illicit drugs. Those who reported patient-centered interactions with their HIV primary care provider had a 45% greater odds of later HAART use, and those with stable housing had twofold greater odds. These findings suggest that interventions to improve the HIV treatment of IDUs and to reduce their HIV health disparities should be comprehensive, promoting better patient-provider engagement, stable housing, HAART education with regard to illicit drug use, and integration of drug-abuse treatment with HIV primary care."
3712,0.009,9.0,"We describe five compliant patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis (TB) that relapsed, with acquisition of resistance by the original Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Both the first and second isolates from each patient had the same IS (insertion sequence) 6110-based DNA fingerprint patterns. Three of the five patients developed TB that was resistant to rifampin alone; no mutation in the region of the rpoB gene was detected by a line probe assay in two of the isolates from these patients. We discuss several factors presumably associated with acquired drug resistance in HIV-infected patients, including exogenous reinfection, drug interactions, malabsorption of drugs, and the presence of a large organism burden."
2991,0.009,9.0,"HIV-related stigma remains a persistent global health concern among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA) in developing nations. The literature is lacking in studies about healthcare students' perceptions of PLWA. This study is the first effort to understand stigmatizing attitudes toward HIV-positive patients by healthcare students in Mwanza, Tanzania, not just those who will be directly treating patients but also those who will be indirectly involved through nonclinical roles, such as handling patient specimens and private health information. A total of 208 students were drawn from Clinical Medicine, Laboratory Sciences, Health Records and Information Management, and Community Health classes at the Tandabui Institute of Health Sciences and Technology for a voluntary survey that assessed stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. Students generally obtained high scores on the overall survey instrument, pointing to low stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA and an overall willingness to treat PLWA with the same standard of care as other patients. However, there are gaps in knowledge that exist among students, such as a comprehensive understanding of all routes of HIV infection. The study also suggests that students who interact with patients as part of their training are less likely to exhibit stigmatizing beliefs toward PLWA. A comprehensive course in HIV infection, one that includes classroom sessions focused on the epidemiology and routes of transmission as well as clinical opportunities to directly interact with PLWA-perhaps through teaching sessions led by PLWA-may allow for significant reductions in stigma toward such patients and improve clinical outcomes for PLWA around the world."
6581,0.009,9.0,"Vitamin D regulates bone metabolism but has also immunoregulatory properties. In HIV-infected patients bone disorders are increasingly observed. Furthermore, low 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) levels have been associated with low CD4(+) counts, immunological hyperactivity, and AIDS progression rates. Few studies have examined the vitamin D status in HIV-infected patients. This study will specifically focus on the effects of antiretroviral agents on vitamin D status. Furthermore, the effect of vitamin D status on CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART will be evaluated. Among 252 included patients the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<35 nmol/liter from April to September and <25 nmol/liter from October to March) was 29%. Female sex, younger age, dark skin, and NNRTI treatment were significant risk factors in univariate analysis, although in multivariate analyses skin pigmentation remained the only independent risk factor. Median 25(OH)D(3) levels were significantly lower in white NNRTI-treated patients [54.5(27.9-73.8) nmol/liter] compared to white PI-treated patients [77.3 (46.6-100.0) nmol/liter, p = 0.007], while among nonwhites no difference was observed. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients had significantly higher blood PTH levels than patients without treatment. Moreover, NNRTI treatment puts patients at risk of elevated PTH levels (>6.5 pmol/liter). Linear regression analysis showed that vitamin D status did not affect CD4 cell recovery after initiation of HAART. In conclusion, 29% of the HIV-1-infected patients had vitamin D deficiency, with skin color as an independent risk factor. NNRTI treatment may add more risk for vitamin D deficiency. Both PI- and NNRTI-treated patients showed higher PTH levels and might therefore be at risk of bone problems. Evaluation of 25(OH)D(3) and PTH levels, especially in NNRTI-treated and dark skinned HIV-1-infected patients, is necessary to detect and treat vitamin D deficiency early."
9347,0.009,9.0,"Type and prevalence of zidovudine (ZDV) resistance mutations in HIV-1-infected children in clinically stable condition and on ZDV monotherapy were analyzed to evaluate the effect of switching to didanosine (ddI) monotherapy or to ZDV plus ddI on the pattern of mutations and on the clinical outcome. Monthly clinical and laboratory controls for HIV-1 infection status were performed; at enrollment and every 4 to 6 months after treatment randomization mutant proviral sequences were evaluated in all the children, whereas viral burden was performed only in a small subgroup of patients randomly selected in each of the three treatment groups. ZDV resistance-associated proviral DNA mutations were defined as low-level resistance (LLR) mutations or medium/high-level resistance (MHLR) mutations; clinical outcome was considered as stable or deteriorating. Results showed that at entry into the study the duration of ZDV therapy was significantly correlated with the presence of mutations, and that the level of resistance given by mutations was associated with the severity both of symptoms and immunodeficiency. After randomization to treatment, in patients with mutations that confer LLR a better clinical outcome with ddI monotherapy than with ZDV plus ddI and ZDV alone was observed in the subsequent 6 months, whereas in patients with mutations that confer MHLR no significant difference among the three treatment groups was found. Data showed also that levels of viral burden at the time of changing therapy are related to clinical outcome if measured by plasma viral load. These results suggest that genotypic resistance assays, together with viral load, may prove useful for rational treatment decisions both at the start of therapy and with failure."
1796,0.009,9.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has emerged as a sexually transmitted infection among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in high-income countries. Little is reported about HCV awareness among MSM, although this is essential for developing targeted prevention strategies. We, therefore, studied HCV awareness and knowledge among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). During two visits, 1 year apart and starting in October 2007, MSM from the ACS answered questions regarding HCV awareness, knowledge of HCV transmission (7 items), complications (8 items) and sexual risk behaviour. We examined the percentage of HCV awareness and correctly answered knowledge items, and whether awareness and knowledge improved significantly over time. Using logistic regression, we studied whether HIV status and sexual risk behaviour were associated with awareness. Seventy percent (312/444) of HIV-negative and 80% (74/92) of HIV-positive MSM reported to have ever heard of HCV on the first visit. Overall, awareness increased with 9% between the first and second visit (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis the association of group sex with HCV awareness was borderline significant (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.97-2.30). Compared with knowledge of transmission routes, knowledge of complications appeared to be limited. In the ACS, awareness of HCV is high, particularly among those reporting group sex, an important risk factor for HCV transmission. The majority of participants had good knowledge of transmission routes, but limited knowledge of complications of chronic HCV infection. HCV prevention messages could be strengthened, therefore, by further addressing the complications of HCV infection. "
8772,0.009,9.0,"Individuals with serious mental illness are at higher risk for HIV than are members of the general population. Although studies have shown that individuals with serious mental illness experience less adequate care and worse physical health outcomes than comparable patients without serious mental illness, little is known about HIV care among individuals with serious mental illness who become infected with HIV. In the present study, we describe patterns of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) use and physician monitoring received by 154 patients with serious mental illness infected with HIV. Participants were recruited from mental health agencies in Los Angeles, California. Data from 762 HIV-only patients from a separate Western U.S. probability sample were used for comparison. High proportions of serious mental illness patients with HIV in our sample appeared to be receiving adequate HIV care. Fifty-one percent of all serious mental illness patients with serious mental illness with HIV were taking HAART, and the majority received close monitoring of their CD4 counts (84%) and viral loads (82%) throughout a 1-year period. HAART use and patterns of CD4 count and viral load monitoring did not differ significantly between patients with both serious mental illness and HIV, and patients with HIV only (all p > 0.05). Specialized programs providing assistance to serious mental illness populations with HIV may be helping to narrow health care disparities as a result of having serious mental illness."
5966,0.009,9.0,"Reports of in vitro resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to zidovudine (AZT) have raised concerns about the development of resistance to other dideoxynucleosides in clinical use. To address this, we have developed a screening assay which supports the growth of clinical isolates and have applied this to a series of paired isolates from patients entered into a phase I trial of didanosine (DDI). Thirteen patients (10 with AIDS, 3 with AIDS-related complex) who had been exposed to AZT for a mean of 6.5 months (range, 1 to 13 months) were treated with DDI at 750 mg/day. Paired isolates were obtained pretherapy and after a mean of 58 weeks (range, 21 to 90) of DDI therapy by coculture of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBLs) with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs. Isolates were passaged only one additional time in PBLs and then tested in parallel in a microtiter assay with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated donor PBLs as targets. PBLs were infected with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infectious doses per 10(7) cells and exposed to DDI (1 to 50 microM) or AZT (0.01 to 100 microM), and supernatants were assayed for the HIV p24 antigen at 7 days postinfection. Control AZT-susceptible and resistant isolates were included. The median pre- and posttherapy DDI susceptibilities of the 13 pairs of isolates were 10.0 microM (range, 1 to 25 microM) and 17.5 microM (range, 2.5 to 50 microM), respectively (P = 0.036; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These studies thus indicated that (i) the susceptibility to DDI tends to mildly decrease with drug exposure; (ii) the susceptibility to AZT improves with time off AZT; (iii) baseline susceptibilities to DDI have a wide range, and the CD4 response may correlate with the initial susceptibility; and (iv) a PBL-based microtiter assay is useful for screening clinical isolated for dideoxynucleoside susceptibility profiles."
8959,0.009,9.0,"Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne viruses in hospitals is discussed, and the infection control system and worker protection and education plan at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) are described. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections."
4831,0.009,9.0,"To better understand whether potent antiretroviral therapies can modify the natural history of HIV-1-associated microsporidiosis and cryptosporidiosis, the response to antimicrobial treatment of these opportunistic infections was evaluated in patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Fifty patients with diarrhoea, all positive for Cryptosporidium parvum or Enterocytozoon bieneusi, were included in the study. Retrospective data were collected concerning demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics of the parasitic infection, antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis against opportunistic infections. Faecal samples were prepared using the Richie formalin-ethyl acetate method and stained using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for detection of Cryptosporidium parvum and Isospora belli, the modified trichrome and calcofluor white technique for detection of Enterocytozoon spp., and iodine for detection of ova, cysts or vegetative forms. Diarrhoea was defined as an abnormal increase in stool liquidity, an abnormal increase in stool frequency and a daily stool weight of more than 250 g for a period of at least 4 days. Patients treated with double antiretroviral therapy or protease inhibitors demonstrated an excellent response and a sustained therapeutic effect after follow-up (range, 5-36 months). The relapse of cryptosporidiosis in two patients who discontinued antiretroviral therapy suggests that the infection might remain in a latent stage. The resolution of the diarrhoea seems to be related to an increased CD4+ cell count rather than to the viral load. In conclusion, these data strongly support the hypothesis that combination antiretroviral therapy is able to greatly modify the course of cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis in patients infected with HIV-1."
4481,0.009,9.0,"Public safety and the right of the health care worker to practise without prejudice based on underlying illness may be at odds for those affected by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Nevertheless, HBV does not preclude entry into a health care profession, and the risk of transmission from health care worker to patient is not uniform across the spectrum of health care fields. In the present article, the authors present an overview of the literature regarding transmission of HBV from the health care worker to the patient, and the current recommendations that vary from province to province within Canada. The establishment of national guidelines to standardize monitoring of HBV infection among health care workers would improve health care workplace safety and patient care."
3945,0.008,8.0,"The State of Amazonas in the Brazilian Amazon region is an area of high prevalence of hepatitis B and D virus (HBV and HDV) infection. The aim of this study was to identify epidemiological patterns and risk factors of HBV and HDV infections in Barcelos, in the basin of the Negro river. A random sample (798 in all) of the total population in the urban area and in 2 rural villages was surveyed. A standardized questionnaire was used and blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: 1.63% had hepatitis B surface antigen, 12.9% had anti-hepatitis B surface antibody and 21.4% had anti-hepatitis B core antigen. The overall prevalence of HBV infection was 24.6%. Anti-hepatitis D was present in 5 subjects, all of them non-natives, and hepatitis B e antigen in 2. A positive association between history of dental treatment with an unqualified dental surgeon was found (P < 0.05). These results suggest a low prevalence of HVB and HDV infection, in contrast with other parts of the Amazon area."
80,0.008,8.0,"We estimated prevalence and incidence of liver condition outcomes, and costs to the health service of diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Tayside, UK. HBV patients were identified from electronic virology data between 1989 and 2003. The health resource costs of HBV for surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) patients and HBV (HBsAg+ or immune, i.e. recovered) patients were calculated. A total of 633 patients had HBV (275 HBsAg+), and were more likely to be male (62% vs. 48%), older (mean age 42.6 vs. 39 . 2 years) and deprived than the general population. The prevalence of immune individuals increased steadily. Post-HBV diagnosis, 24% of immune and 13% of HBsAg+ patients were diagnosed with a liver condition. The median cost per immune patient (£3023) was greater than per HBsAg+ patient (£1498) (P=0.02). While increasing prevalence of immune HBV patients highlights an increase in screening and treatment, the costs associated with this group are high."
7773,0.008,8.0,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) poses a major diagnostic challenge in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this retrospective study, we sought to assess the clinical utility of percutaneous liver biopsy as a diagnostic aid for FUO in HIV-infected patients and identify the factors associated with a greater likelihood of a positive diagnostic yield form this procedure. A total of 101 HIV-infected patients with FUO, who had undergone percutaneous liver biopsy in an HIV care hospital, served as the study population. The results obtained from percutaneous liver biopsy were categorized into three groups: (i) diagnostic, (ii) helpful, and (iii) not helpful. Diagnostic and helpful results were classified as useful. The mean (SD) age of patients was 37.6 (6.9) years, and the median (interquartile range [IQR]) CD4 count was 18 (3-62) cells/mm(3). The median (IQR) duration of fever was 20 (8-30) days. Percutaneous liver biopsy was diagnostic in 51 patients (50.5%), helpful in 12 (11.9%) and not helpful in 38 (37.6%) patients. On multivariate analyses, elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase level (OR 1.27 per one time elevation from the upper normal range; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = 0.023), and fever duration of less than 3 weeks (OR 3.82; 95% CI, 1.03-14.18; P = 0.046) was significantly associated with the likelihood of the biopsy findings being classified as useful. Our study supports the case for percutaneous liver biopsy as a useful diagnostic aid in HIV-infected patients with FUO. "
4890,0.008,8.0,"There is limited information available about the prevalence and pattern of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance mutations (DRMs) among antiretroviral therapy (ART) experienced patients from northern India. Results of genotypic drug resistance testing were obtained from plasma samples of 128 patients, who had presented with clinical or immunological failure to treatment after at least six months of ART. Major DRMs associated with any of the three classes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) and protease inhibitors (PI), were seen in 120 out of 128 patients (93.8% prevalence). NRTI and NNRTI DRMs were each seen in 115/128 (89.8%) patients, with M184V, M41L, D67N and T215Y being the most frequent among NRTI associated mutations, and K103N, G190A, Y181C and A98G among NNRTI associated ones. PI DRMs were observed in 14/128 (10.9%) patients, with L10I, V82A and L89V being the commonest. These results present a high prevalence of DRMs among ART experienced patients from northern India with clinical or immunological failure of therapy. It emphasizes the need for regular testing of plasma samples of such patients for DRMs in order to detect and replace a failing regimen early, and also the use of HIV drug resistance genotyping of ART naive individuals prior to initiating first line ART for possible transmitted resistance. It is very important to enhance the access of patients to ARV drugs so that their compliance could be improved and hence development of DRMs be minimized."
2104,0.008,8.0,"Barriers to retention in HIV care are detrimental to patients' progress along the HIV continuum of care. Previous literature has focused on individual, client-level barriers, and interventions to address them. In contrast, less work has examined the role of system-level barriers on HIV care outcomes. This study seeks to understand how individual and systemic barriers individually are associated with clinic appointment attendance and virologic suppression in HIV-infected patients attending the largest HIV clinic in Miami-Dade, FL. In addition, we examined the synergistic effects of these barriers as potential syndemic factors on these health outcomes. Barriers to clinic attendance were determined in a face-to-face study interview with 444 HIV-infected outpatients (187 regular attenders, 191 irregular attenders, and 66 nonattenders) identified from electronic medical records. Compared with the other attendance groups, nonattenders had higher viral loads, were less likely to be virologically suppressed, had lower CD4 counts, had higher depressive symptoms, life chaos, lower quality of life, and higher rates of food insecurity, and recent drug use. Additionally, nonattenders compared with regular attenders had lower physician relationship ratings, had lower medical information clarity and more often reported transportation as a barrier to clinic attendance. When viewed as a syndemic, compared with patients not reporting any barriers, patients with 3 or more individual-level barriers were more likely to have a detectable viral load (odds ratio = 3.60, 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.61). Our findings suggest that patients presenting to the clinic with multiple barriers should be prioritized for assistance and future interventions to improve retention in care. Interventions should address multiple individual and system-level barriers simultaneously with particular attention to addressing depressive symptoms, organizational skills, relationship with the physician, and HIV-related health education.

609,0.008,8.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli are monoxenic protozoa that have been recognized as the causative agents of chronic diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals, especially HIV-infected subjects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these intestinal protozoa in HIV-positive patients in the Triângulo Mineiro region of Brazil and to correlate the presence of these infections with clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data of the patients. Oocysts were detected in stool samples of 10 (16.9%) of the 59 patients studied, while Cryptosporidium spp. were present in 10.1% (6/59) and C. belli in 6.7% (4/59). The frequency of these parasites was higher among patients with diarrheic syndrome and CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200 cells/mm 3 , demonstrating the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. A significant association was observed between the lack of adherence to antiretroviral therapy and the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and/or C. belli. Parasitism with Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in February and April, the months following the period of high rainfall. The same was not observed for C. belli. Genetic characterization of two isolates led to the identification of Cryptosporidium parvum, one of the main species associated with the zoonotic transmission of cryptosporidiosis."
3108,0.008,8.0,"The study investigated the impact of xerostomia on oral health and quality of life (QoL) among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who were attending for routine HIV monitoring in Australia. This cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire survey and oral screening (OS) included 100 subjects who were HIV positive. The OS was conducted by a dentist blinded to the subject's survey responses. Xerostomia was determined by asking the subjects a single question. Subjects with xerostomia were found to have increased caries activity and poorer QoL, especially in the psychological dimensions of the oral health impact profile. Age and duration of HIV infection were associated with xerostomia. Early diagnosis of xerostomia and intervention with preventive dental care would potentially reduce caries and improve QoL among patients infected with HIV-1. Ongoing chronic inflammation of salivary glands despite the beneficial effects of antiretroviral therapy may play a role in the etiology of xerostomia in patients infected with HIV and requires further study."
2503,0.008,8.0,"Many oral lesions are strongly associated with HIV infection. Along with the HIV-infected individual's T helper cell count (CD4 + cell count), they indicate the severity of immune suppression. It is important for dental professionals to recognize these lesions early, as it alerts patients to their HIV status, and allows them to receive appropriate and prompt treatment for their HIV infection and related oral conditions. An atlas of the oral lesions commonly associated with HIV infection is presented. To update dental providers and assist them in the recognition and diagnosis of these conditions, the recent criteria for diagnosis suggested by the European Economic Community (EEC) Clearinghouse on Oral Problems Related to HIV Infection and the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre on Oral Manifestations of the Immunodeficiency virus are also presented."
7469,0.008,8.0,"Molecular mechanisms related to occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, particularly those based on genotype C infection, have rarely been determined thus far in the ongoing efforts to determine infection mechanisms. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the mutation patterns in the surface open reading frame (S ORF) underlying occult infections of HBV genotype C in the present study. Nested PCRs were applied to 624 HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negative Korean subjects. Cloning and sequencing of the S ORF gene was applied to 41 occult cases and 40 control chronic carriers. Forty-one (6.6%) of the 624 Korean adults with HBsAg-negative serostatus were found to be positive for DNA according to nested PCR tests. Mutation frequencies in the three regions labeled here as preS1, preS2, and S were significantly higher in the occult subjects compared to the carriers in all cases. A total of two types of deletions, preS1 deletions in the start codon and preS2 deletions as well as nine types of point mutations were significantly implicated in the occult infection cases. Mutations within the ""a"" determinant region in HBsAg were found more frequently in the occult subjects than in the carriers. Mutations leading to premature termination of S ORF were found in 16 occult subjects (39.0%) but only in one subject from among the carriers (2.5%). In conclusion, our data suggest that preS deletions, the premature termination of S ORF, and ""a"" determinant mutations are associated with occult infections of HBV genotype C among a HBsAg-negative population. The novel mutation patterns related to occult infection introduced in the present study can help to broaden our understanding of HBV occult infections."
6893,0.008,8.0,"Lamivudine is a major drug approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Emergence of drug-resistant mutants with amino acid substitutions in the YMDD motif is a well-documented problem during long-term lamivudine therapy. Here we report a novel lamivudine-resistant strain of HBV with an intact YMDD motif, which included an amino acid substitution, rtA181T, in the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of HBV polymerase. The substitution also induced a unique amino acid substitution (W172L) in the overlapping hepatitis B surface (HBs) protein. The YMDD mutant strains were not detected even by using the sensitive peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method. The detected nucleotide substitution was accompanied by the emergence of an additional nucleotide substitution that induced amino acid change (S331C) in the spacer domain. The rtA181T mutant strain displayed a threefold decrease in susceptibility to lamivudine in in vitro experiments in comparison with the wild type. In vivo analysis using human hepatocyte-chimeric mice confirmed the resistance of this mutant strain to lamivudine. We developed a method to detect this novel rtA181T mutation and a previously reported rtA181T mutation with the HBs stop codon using restriction fragment length polymorphism PCR and identified one patient with the latter pattern among 40 patients with lamivudine resistance. In conclusion, although the incidence is not high, we have to be careful regarding the emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutant strains with intact YMDD motif."
6426,0.008,8.0,"Europe is currently observing a significant rise in non-B subtypes. Consequently, the effect of genetic variability on therapy response or genotypic resistance interpretation algorithms is an emerging concern. The purpose of this study is to investigate the amino acid substitutions selected under drug pressure in the protease of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes B and G, and determine if there are any significant differences. We investigated therapy-related and subtype-related substitutions in the protease, considering subtype, overall protease inhibitor treatment and individual drug exposure. Many mutations were significantly related to protease inhibitor (PI) therapy, with mutations exclusive to subtype B or subtype G. Some mutations are at positions related to resistance in both subtypes, but the amino acid substitution is different. Other mutations were significantly associated with subtype and PI selective pressure (p<0.05), pointing towards a differential selective pressure in both subtypes. We confirmed previous reports on the subtype-dependent selection of D30N and 89I, and identified a new mutation with such differential selective pressure: 37D was preferentially selected by lopinavir in subtype B. Other novel mutations found under therapy pressure were 13A, 35N, K55R, I66F, I72L/T, T74S, 82M and 89I/V. Our study indicates that even though in general, drug selective pressure and resistance pathways are relatively similar between subtypes B and G, some differences do occur, leading to subtype-dependent substitutions."
2231,0.008,8.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been associated with increased rates of single- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis in the New York City area. In order to examine the relationship of HIV infection to drug-resistant tuberculosis in other selected regions of the United States, we established a registry of cases of culture-proven tuberculosis. Data were collected from sites participating in an NIH-funded, community-based HIV clinical trials group. All cases of tuberculosis, regardless of HIV status, which occurred between January 1992 and June 1994 were recorded. Overall, 1,373 cases of tuberculosis were evaluated, including 425 from the New York City area, and 948 from seven other metropolitan areas. The overall prevalence of resistance to one or more drugs was 20.4%, and 5.6% of isolates were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin (MDR). In the New York City area, HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely than persons not known to be HIV-infected, to have resistance to at least one drug (37% versus 19%) and MDR (19% versus 6%). In other geographic areas, overall drug resistance was 16%, and only 2.2% of isolates were MDR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, HIV infection was shown to be a risk factor for drug-resistant tuberculosis, independent of geographic location, history of prior therapy, age, and race. We concluded that HIV infection is associated with increased rates of resistance to antituberculosis drugs in both the New York City area and other geographic areas. MDR tuberculosis is occurring predominantly in the New York City area and is highly correlated with HIV infection."
9760,0.008,8.0,"The prevalence of serum markers of delta hepatitis was determined prospectively in 82 intravenous drug abusers at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Seventeen were HIV negative, 30 were HIV positive without acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 35 had been diagnosed as having AIDS. Antihepatitis D virus (HDV) in serum was measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and also by solid phase capture radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HDV. HDV antigen and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were also measured. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBs were determined by using a commercially available RIA. Anti-HDV (RIA) was only detected in serum that contained HBsAg. These anti-HDV (RIA) positive samples also tested positive with the commercial anti-HDV electroimmunoassay. In addition, the commercial anti-HDV ELISA detected anti-HDV in some serum samples that were negative for HBsAg; these anti HDV-positive HBsAg-negative samples were frequently lipemic or contained rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of HBsAg and anti-HBs did not differ significantly with the stage of HIV disease. HBsAg was detected in 3 of 13 (23%) HIV-negative, 5 of 29 (17%) HIV-positive, and 4 of 18 (22%) patients with AIDS. IgG and IgM anti-HDV (RIA) was positive in 2 of 3 HIV-negative and 4 of 5 HIV-positive pre-AIDS HBsAg-positive subjects. However, none of 4 AIDS patients had anti-HDV. The difference between AIDS and non-AIDS patients was statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). HDV antigen was detected in serum from one AIDS patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim of the present study was to investigate hepatitis B (HB) knowledge and vaccination acceptance among health care personnel in southwestern Greece, using the Hepatitis B Vaccine Knowledge and Acceptance Questionnaire. One hundred eighty-three employees participated (71 males). Occupation (p < .001), higher education (p < .001), and vaccination (p = .007) were significantly related to HB knowledge. The rate of HBV vaccination coverage was 70.9%. Participants considering themselves at high risk for HBV infection did not report significantly increased vaccination rates. In the multivariate analysis, university personnel (p = .002), occupational category (p < .001), and HB knowledge (p = .049) were significantly associated with vaccination. In conclusion, 29% of hospital personnel were not vaccinated mainly due to negligence. Occupation, education, and knowledge about HB seem to be associated with HBV vaccination."
5629,0.008,8.0,"Treatment with antiretroviral agents (ARVs) during pregnancy is important to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but their use has been associated with low bone mineral density in adult patients. Currently, there are no data regarding the bone status of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to evaluate cortical bone status at delivery in a group of HIV-infected women who received ARV during pregnancy and to monitor the changes occurring during the first year postpartum. We studied 33 HIV-infected and 116 HIV-uninfected healthy Caucasian women within 4 days from delivery. Follow-up measurements were performed at 4 and 12 months postpartum in 17 HIV-infected and 55 healthy women. Cortical bone status was evaluated by quantitative ultrasonography at the mid-tibia, and bone measurements were expressed as the speed of sound (SOS). HIV-infected women after delivery had a median SOS of 3,985 (3,567-4,242) m/s, while the median SOS of healthy women was 4,025 (3,643-4,250) m/s. The difference was not significant (t = 0.39, P = 0.69). No significant differences were observed between ARV-exposed and control subjects at 4 and 12 months. Our data suggest that ARV during pregnancy and the first year after delivery does not affect negatively cortical bone status."

4806,0.008,8.0,"Medication adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is currently a topic of major importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome care. HAART has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV infection. Many people with HIV now live active and productive lives, with the disease itself having minimal impact on their lifespan. Unlike treatment for other chronic diseases, achieving the full benefit of HAART requires an extremely high level of adherence to potent antiretroviral combinations that is often difficult to achieve given the high pill burdens, drug interactions and adverse events associated with treatment. In this paper, the present knowledge regarding antiretroviral medication adherence is summarized with a focus on understanding the importance of adherence, the relationship between adherence and treatment response, the challenges and barriers facing patients trying to achieve optimal adherence, reasons for nonadherence, and the current directions and issues relevant to future adherence research."
1718,0.008,8.0,"Nonadherence to combination antiretroviral (ARV) therapies (cART) is highly prevalent and significantly increases the risk of adverse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease outcomes. The current study evaluated the hypothesis that prospective memory-a dissociable aspect of episodic memory describing the ability to execute a future intention-plays an important role in successful cART adherence. Seventy-nine individuals with HIV infection who were prescribed at least one ARV medication underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological and neuromedical evaluation prior to completing a 1-month observation of their cART adherence as measured by electronic medication monitoring. Nonadherent individuals (n = 31) demonstrated significantly poorer prospective memory functioning as compared to adherent persons (n = 48), particularly on an index of time-based ProM (i.e., elevated loss of time errors). Deficits in time-based prospective memory were independently predictive of cART nonadherence, even after considering the possible influence of established predictors of adherence, such as general cognitive impairment (e.g., retrospective learning and memory) and psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression). These findings extend a nascent literature showing that impairment in time-based prospective memory significantly increases the risk of medication nonadherence and therefore may guide the development of novel strategies for intervention.

7643,0.008,8.0,"The objective of this study is to measure HIV/AIDS knowledge among patients with mental illness in Brazil and to examine individual and treatment setting predictors of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional national multicenter study among 2,475 patients in 26 randomly selected mental health institutions throughout Brazil. We used Item Response Theory to standardize knowledge scores and multilevel multiple linear regression to determine the effect of individual and treatment setting characteristics on standardized knowledge score. Schizophrenia was the main diagnosis (48%) of participants. Mean knowledge score was 6.78 (range 1-10). Treatment setting characteristics were not associated with knowledge scores. Higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), previous HIV testing and consistent condom use; lower HIV/AIDS knowledge scores were significantly associated with specific sociodemographic, psychiatric, and HIV risk-perception factors. Psychiatric patients in Brazil lag behind the general population with knowledge scores comparable to those of nearly a decade ago. The mental health system in Brazil and elsewhere must consider strategies beyond dispensing information, for preventing HIV/AIDS transmission in the psychiatric population."
2192,0.008,8.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to play a major role in the immune response to HIV infection. The HIV-specific CTL response is much stronger than previously documented in an infectious disease, yet estimates of CTL frequency derived from limiting-dilution analysis (LDA) are relatively low and comparable to other viral infections. Here we show that individual CTL clones specific for peptides from HIV gag and pol gene products are present at high levels in the peripheral blood of three infected patients and that individual CTL clones may represent between 0.2% and 1% of T cells. Previous LDA in one donor had shown a frequency of CTL precursors of 1/8000, suggesting that LDA may underestimate CTL effector frequency. In some donors individual CTL clones persisted in vivo for at least 5 years. In contrast, in one patient there was a switch in CTL usage suggesting that different populations of CTLs can be recruited during infection. These data imply strong stimulation of CTLs, potentially leading some clones to exhaustion."
5669,0.008,8.0,"The demand for dental treatment by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is rising. Some professionals are still reluctant to treat these patients, despite the extremely low likelihood of professional transmission, which increases only in patients with a very elevated viral load. The complications rate after dental intervention is very low, even in patients with considerable immunologic deterioration. The dentist should pay special attention to the general clinical situation and immunologic and HIV virologic status of the seropositive patient, and to the presence of hemostasis alterations or of other concomitant diseases. Antiretroviral or any other drug treatments must also be recorded, in order to avoid possible interactions with clinician-prescribed drugs. Tooth extraction is the most common dental treatment and requires no antibiotic therapy except in cases of neutropenia or severe immunosuppression. Other dental treatments do not require special precautions, and the complications index among these patients is similar to that among the uninfected patient population. With this background, there is a need to make the clinician-in-training aware of the importance of regular dental health checkups as part of the health care routine of HIV-infected patients and to familiarize the clinician with their management, while not disregarding the unquestionable requirement to carry out the general and specific prevention measures to be adopted in all cases."

There are few published studies concerning cryptosporidiosis and Cryptosporidium genotypes in Iranian immunocompromised patients and none of them describe risk factors. This study was undertaken to identify prevalence, genotypes and risk factors for cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients. Three fecal samples were obtained at two day intervals from each of the 183 patients and processed with modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining methods and 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The overall infection prevalence was 6%. Cryptosporidium parvum was identified in isolates from five HIV-infected patients, one patient who had undergone bone marrow transplantation and one with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cryptosporidium hominis was identified in isolates from two HIV-infected patients and two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. According to univariate analysis, the statistically significant factors were diarrhea (OR = 21.7, CI = 2.83-78.4, P= 0.003), CD4 + lymphocytes less than 100 cells/mm(3) (OR = 41.3, CI = 13.45-114.8, P < 0.0001), other microbial infections (OR = 7.1321.7, CI = 1.97-25.73, P = 0.006), weight loss (OR = 73.78, CI = 15.5-350, P < 0.0001), abdominal pain (OR = 10.29, CI = 2.81-37.74.4, P= 0.001), dehydration (OR = 72.1, CI = 17.6-341.5, P < 0.0001), vomiting (OR = 4.87, CI = 1.4-16.9, P= 0.015), nausea (OR = 9.4, CI = 2.38-37.2, P < 0.001), highly active antiretroviral therapy (OR = 0.089, CI = 0.01-0.8, P= 0.015) and diarrhea in household members (OR = 7.37, CI = 2.04-26.66, P= 0.001). After multivariate analysis and a backward deletion process, only < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3) maintained a significant association with infection. The authors recommend that this infection should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, weight loss and dehydration in general and in diarrheal individuals with < 100 CD4 + T-lymphocytes/mm(3)."
7294,0.008,8.0,"In 1989 the prevalence of hepatitis B virus markers was studied by radioimmunoassay in a sample of 1,426 healthy children, 3 to 11 years old, attending kindergarten and the primary schools in a large urban area of the Apulia Region in Southern Italy, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among pregnant women is 5.6%. The overall prevalence of any hepatitis B virus marker was 3.4%, increasing from 1.7% in 3- to 5-year-old children to 5% in 10- to 11-year-old children (P less than 0.002). Prevalence was not associated with the father's years of schooling (odds ratio, 1.98; confidence interval, 95% (0.9 to 4.6] or with the family size (odds ratio, 2.96; confidence interval, (0.7 to 11.8]. The overall HBsAg prevalence was 0.8, a rate that was lower than the 5.6% found in pregnant women. The finding of only 12 HBsAg-positive children of the 1,426 tested, despite 80 of them being born to HBsAg-positive carrier mothers (on the basis of the 5.6% HBsAg prevalence among pregnant women), is probably attributable to the low proportion (5%) of hepatitis B e antigen positivity among the HBsAg-positive carrier mothers in the study area. The observed low HBV infection rate in younger age groups, which confirms recent studies in other areas of Italy, appears to be the result of several factors: improved socioeconomic conditions; decreased family size; and increased use of disposable syringes in the last few years."
6727,0.008,8.0,"In the battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), focusing treatment on early intervention of its underlying condition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, may help reduce the disability associated with AIDS. A comprehensive care hospital unit featuring physicians with expertise in HIV treatment, clinical research activities, and home health services may offer the most effective care for HIV patients. The preventive nature of comprehensive care also can reduce costs through decreased hospitalization, integrated hospital revenue centers, patients' minimized lost work time, and reduction of medical disability."
1150,0.008,8.0,"Substantial changes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related sexual behavior have been reported by virtually every survey of homosexual/bisexual men in the last decade. This paper uses a behavior-based simulation to examine how such changes are likely to affect the long-term future of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic among homosexual men. Data from the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project in New York City are used to estimate age-specific patterns of unprotected anogenital contact and behavioral change from 1980 to 1991. Model projections are validated using New York City surveillance data on AIDS incidence from 1981 to 1991. The current levels of unsafe sex reported in the Longitudinal AIDS Impact Project are shown to be almost exactly on the epidemic threshold. If this behavior were maintained, HIV prevalence would slowly decline in the population, but with just one additional unsafe sexual partner per year HIV would instead become endemic, with seroprevalence of about 65% in the oldest group and about 25% in the youngest. Transmission dynamics in the youngest group are analyzed in detail. For this group, the assortative age-matching bias in partner selection patterns raises the unsafe behavior threshold slightly in the long run."
9717,0.008,8.0,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can improve immune system function through suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, paradoxical immune response may develop in some patients as a result of effective therapy followed by immune restoration. The phenomena is known as IRS, immune reconstitution syndrome/immune recovery syndrome. IRS can develop within weeks to months after cART is commenced and the time is related to the type of the disease. There are but scant reports concerning IRS-NHL (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) in HIV-1 positive subjects. We observed 4 (33%) cases of IRS-NHL out of 12 patients in whom NHL was diagnosed. As a result of potent cART they reached viral suppression in a mean time of 15 weeks followed by a rise in CD4(+) T cells within 16.5 weeks. The diagnosis of NHL was established at a mean time of 36 weeks after cART was introduced and 20 weeks after the CD4 T cell increase was achieved. This may indicate that the immune reconstitution as a result of cART was a predisposing factor for the development of NHL in our patients. There was prompt progression of the disease and the outcome was fatal in all cases. IRS-NHL should be suspected in any case of lymphadenopathy, generalized or limited to the abdomen or periphery, which develops after immune recovery due to potent cART within a few months."
7248,0.008,8.0,"A cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-discordant couples was established to evaluate risk factors associated with heterosexual viral transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to document the HIV-uninfected status among members of discordant heterosexual couples and to rule out immunosilent infection. HIV DNA PCR specific for a gag gene region was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 203 HIV antibody-negative adults who have long-term heterosexual relationships with HIV-infected partners. The results were negative for 200 but consistently positive in three individuals. More extensive evaluation of these three individuals with an additional primer pair specific for the envelope gene, quantitative DNA PCR, multiple additional time points, and variable nucleotide tandem repeat analyses revealed specimen processing problems in two cases but an apparent true positive PCR assay in the third case. This subject remains antibody and PCR negative for a 32-month follow-up period. These results confirm previous studies that document a negligible incidence of occult HIV infection as delineated by PCR in antibody negative heterosexual partners of HIV-infected individuals. Specimen processing errors occur at a low rate (1% in this study) and require careful evaluation. The possibility of transient, aborted infection versus successful infection with a long immunosilent period was observed in a single individual. Definitive resolution of infection status will require long-term evaluation."
2394,0.008,8.0,"Food insecurity is increasingly reported as an important barrier of patient adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in both resource-poor and rich settings. However, unlike in resource rich-settings, very few quantitative studies to date have investigated the association of food insecurity with patient adherence to ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study examines the association between food insecurity and adherence to ART among HIV-infected adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)."
952,0.008,8.0,"Studies were conducted to determine if there is a mechanistic basis for reports of suboptimal virologic responses and concerns regarding the safety of regimens containing the combination of tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and didanosine (ddI) by assessing the pharmacokinetic consequences of coadministration of these drugs on intracellular nucleotides. This was a prospective and longitudinal study in HIV-1-infected patients of adding either TDF or ddI to a stable antiretroviral regimen containing the other drug. Intracellular concentrations of the nucleotide analogs TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) and ddATP and the endogenous purine nucleotides dATP and 2'-dGTP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured. A total of 16 patients were enrolled into the two study arms and a study extension. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations (median, 120 fmol/10(6) cells) and ddATP concentrations (range, 1.50 to 7.54 fmol/10(6) cells in two patients) were unaffected following addition of ddI or TDF to a stable regimen containing the other drug. While coadministration of ddI and TDF for 4 weeks did not appear to impact dATP or dGTP concentrations, cross-sectional analysis suggested that extended therapy with ddI-containing regimens, irrespective of TDF coadministration, may decrease dATP and ddATP concentrations. Addition of TDF or ddI to a stable regimen including the other drug, in the context of ddI dose reduction, did not adversely affect the concentration of dATP, dGTP, TFV-DP, or ddATP. The association between longer-term ddI therapy and reduced intracellular nucleotide concentrations and this observation's implication for the efficacy and toxicity of ddI-containing regimens deserve further study."
3642,0.007,7.0,"We conducted a large-scale survey to determine the frequency and clinical significance of mutations in the pre-core region of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sera from 263 patients with chronic HBV infection were analyzed by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified HBV DNA. Four major missense/nonsense mutations (M) were found: (M1) C-->T at nucleotide position 1856, Pro-->Ser at codon 15; (M2) G-->A at position 1896, Trp-->stop at codon 28; (M3) G-->A at position 1898, Gly-->Ser at codon 29; and (M4) G-->A at position 1899, Gly-->Asp at codon 29. The commonest conserved mutation was M0: T-->C at position 1858, Pro-->Pro at codon 15. We found that M1 and M2 were mutually exclusive, M3 was only found in association with M1, and M4 was predominantly found in association with M2. All patients with M1 but none of those with M2 had M0. The invariable coexistence of certain mutations in codon 15 and codons 28 and 29 and the mutual exclusion of other mutations in these two noncontiguous regions is related to the stem-loop structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence located in the precore/core region. M2 and M4 enhance the stability of the stem by providing two additional paired sites. M1 destroys an existing base pair. However, M1 only occurred in the presence of M0, which provides an extra paired site, and 50% of patients with M1 had M3, a compensatory mutation that restores base pairing at this site. Our data support the proposed secondary structure of the pre-genome encapsidation sequence. The primary function of the mutations in the pre-core region is to enhance stability of this secondary structure to ensure perpetuation of viral replication."
6234,0.007,7.0,"Despite the use of antiretroviral medications during the antenatal/perinatal period, 280 to 370 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected infants are born each year in the United States. Women who might transmit the virus to their infants are (1) those not offered antenatal testing due to perceived low risk; (2) those who are noncompliant with their antiretroviral regimen; (3) those with prophylaxis failures despite good compliance; and (4) those who present late to delivery without prenatal care. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention sponsored MIRIAD (mother-infant rapid intervention at delivery) to study rapid testing of women who present late in pregnancy and/or to labor and delivery with unknown HIV status. MIRIAD was implemented in 18 hospitals in 6 American cities. In Atlanta, GA, the 2 participating hospitals had institutional differences that created different models of implementation. Hospital 1 is large and publicly funded, practicing team nursing and utilizing laboratory-based testing. Hospital 2 is a medium-sized nonprofit, whose primary nursing model allowed for specially trained staff to do point-of-care (POC) testing. Regardless of hospital type, nursing care paradigms, or testing model, facilities interested in successfully implementing a similar protocol must formulate policies for testing, notification, and treatment as well as consider dedicating a staff member to the program."
6501,0.007,7.0,"Hepatitis B infection affects two billion people worldwide and 350 million of these are chronically infected. Chronic hepatitis B virus is one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. If it is left untreated, about one-third of affected people will develop progressive and possibly fatal liver disease, like hepatic cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, five nucleos(t)ide analogs are approved for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. They are: lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In this work, we developed and validated an UPLC-Tandem mass spectrometry assay method capable of monitoring lamivudine, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir plasma concentrations. Both standards and quality controls (high, medium and low) were prepared in human plasma. Each sample was added with internal standard (5'amino-5'deoxy-thymidine) and then drugs were extracted through a protein precipitation protocol with acetonitrile+0.1% formic acid and then dried. The extracts were resuspended in water and then injected into the chromatographic system. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 μm 2.1 × 150 mm column, with a gradient of water and acetonitrile, both added with formic acid (0.05%). Accuracy, intra-day and inter-day precision at quality controls levels fitted all FDA guidelines for all analytes, while matrix effects and recoveries resulted stable between samples for each analyte. Finally, we tested this method by monitoring plasma concentrations in 30 HBV+ patients with good results. This simple analytical method could represent a useful tool for the management of anti-HBV therapy."
2468,0.007,7.0,"The dental health of 94 HIV-positive patients was investigated by the sum of carious, missing and filling teeth (DMF index), plaque (Silness and Löe) and bleeding point indices (Lenox and Kopczyk). Blood parameters were evaluated, including total lymphocytes, CD4+ lymphocytes, beta-2-microglobulin, platelets, the Quick index, and immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM and IgA). Patient oral parameters were contrasted with risk group (intravenous drug users homo- and heterosexuals) and controls. An evaluation was also made of differences in dental condition as a function of CD4+ cell number, according to the latest CDC classification (1992). HIV-positive intravenous drug users were found to present poorer DMF, plaque and bleeding point indices than the rest of the patients. No relationship was observed between CD4+ cell numbers in blood and dental condition, thus suggesting that the deteriorated dental health observed is a consequence of factors inherent to the risk groups involved rather than of the altered blood parameters."
1576,0.007,7.0,"Dentists in the Philippines were surveyed for evidence of past hepatitis A and B virus infections. Of the 234 dentists examined, 201 (85.9 per cent) were found to have been infected by HA virus and 137 (58.5 per cent) had been infected by HB virus. The proportion with evidence of past HB virus infection increased as the years in dental practice increased. This increment with age was not found in the general population of the Philippines. It is considered that the incremental pattern could be attributed to the summation of risk during many years of providing dental treatment. Comparing the proportion of dentists with HBV antibodies (anti-HBs/c) in the Philippines, Japan, USA and Denmark, the Philippine dentists were found to be more frequently infected than dentists in the other countries. However, the increment in the proportion positive for HBV as the years in practice advanced was consistent with that found in Japan. The prevalence of post HA virus infection in Philippine dentists was higher than the proportion for dentists in Japan but in both countries it is probable that dentists are infected at the same rate as the general population."
5770,0.007,7.0,"The first HIV-infected patients were treated in 1986, however, at that time medicines inhibiting HIV replication were not available. Solely the complications of AIDS and opportunistic infections could be treated. The HIV replication inhibition capacity of antiretroviral nucleoside and ribavirin were tested in Hungary in 1987, an early date even in international practice. The first nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), azidothymidine, presently called zidovudine (ZDV), was introduced in 1989. By giving patients the appropriate dosage of this, the progression of the disease could be delayed by approximately 6 months to one year. In 1991, the application of two new NRTI was commenced, namely zalcitabine (DDC) and didanosine (DDI). These medicines were applied partly in case of ZDV intolerance and as a part of the sequential monotherapy. In 1994 and 1995 two new NRTI's were introduce, namely stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3 TC). At that same time, to obtain a more effective replication inhibition method, a double NRTI combination became part of the therapeutic protocol. The year 1996 resulted in significant changes. At the beginning of the year, two compounds belonging to two new therapeutic procedures. These are saquinavir (SQV) and delavirdine (DLV) belonging to the groups of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, respectively. The so-called virus cocktails and the effective active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) were applied and, later, to monitor the efficiency of the treatment, the opportunity was provided to measure the copy number of HIV-RNS. The treatment of the HIV disease entails a number of unanswered questions. The maximum result that can be achieved by using today's therapeutic methods is to prolong that particular phase of the HIV disease, which secures the patient a fairly good quality of life. The new combination of the antiretroviral compounds produced by the pharmaceutical industry provides better changes to prolong said period by years, sometimes decades. However, the real solutions to the problem are only theoretically known treatment procedures (gene therapy, cytokins) today."
2586,0.007,7.0,"The level of genetic variation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a member of the lentivirus genus of the Retroviridae family, is high relative to that of retroviruses in some other genera. The high error rates of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in cell-free systems suggest an explanation for this high genetic variation. To test whether the in vivo rate of mutation during reverse transcription of HIV-1 is as high as predicted by cell-free studies, and therefore higher than that rates of mutation of retroviruses in other genera, we developed an in vivo assay for detecting forward mutations in HIV-1, using the lacZ alpha peptide gene as a reporter for mutations. This system allows the rates and types of mutations that occur during a single cycle of replication to be studied. We found that the forward mutation rate for HIV-1 was 3.4 x 10(-5) mutations per bp per cycle. Base substitution mutations predominated; G-to-A transition mutations were the most common base substitution. The in vivo mutation rates for HIV-1 are three and seven times higher than those previously reported for two other retroviruses, spleen necrosis virus and bovine leukemia virus, respectively. In contrast, our calculated in vivo mutation rate for HIV-1 is about 20-fold lower than the error rate of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, with the same target sequence. This finding indicates that HIV-1 reverse transcription in vivo is not as error prone as predicted from the fidelity of purified reverse transcriptase in cell-free studies. Our data suggest that the fidelity of purified HIV-1 reverse transcriptase may not accurately reflect the level of genetic variation in a natural infection."
6550,0.007,7.0,Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects people worldwide but the local burden especially in pregnant women and their new born babies is unknown. In Rwanda HIV-infected individuals who are also infected with HBV are supposed to be initiated on ART immediately. HBV is easily transmitted from mother to child during delivery. We sought to estimate the prevalence of chronic HBV infection among pregnant women attending ante-natal clinic (ANC) in Rwanda and to determine factors associated with HBV and HIV co-infection.
9794,0.007,7.0,"Viral liver diseases are frequent comorbidities and major contributors to death in HIV-positive individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Although cure of hepatitis C and control of hepatitis B with antivirals avert liver disease progression in most HIV-coinfected patients, the lack of satisfactory treatment for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection remains a major threat for developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in this population. In the European Union (EU) and North America, sexual contact has replaced injection drug use that has been the major transmission route for HDV in HIV-positive persons. PegIFNα is the only approved HDV therapy; however, sustained HDV-RNA clearance is achieved by less than 25%. The recent discovery of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide as the key hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV cell entry receptor has opened the door to a new therapeutic era. Indeed, promising results have been released using Myrcludex-B, a sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide inhibitor. More encouraging are data with new classes of HDV blockers, such as prenylation inhibitors (i.e. lonafarnib) and nucleic acid polymers. At this time, sustained suppression of HDV replication is the primary goal of HDV therapy, as it is associated with normalization of liver enzymes and histological improvement. Of note, the use of specific antivirals for HDV must be given along with anti-HBV agents to prevent HBV rebounds following removal of viral interference. The lack of persistent forms of HDV-RNA could provide a unique opportunity for curing hepatitis delta, even without eliminating HBV circular covalently closed DNA. Ultimately, suppression of HDV replication along with hepatitis B surface antigen clearance once drugs are off would be the best reflect of hepatitis delta cure."
9162,0.007,7.0,"We present health and demographic surveillance system data to assess associations with health care utilization and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) service receipt in a high HIV prevalence area of western Kenya. Eighty-six percent of 15,302 residents indicated a facility/clinician for routine medical services; 60% reported active (within the past year) attendance. Only 34% reported a previous HIV test, and self-reported HIV prevalence was 6%. Active attendees lived only slightly closer to their reported service site (2.8 versus 3.1 km; P < 0.001) compared with inactive attendees. Multivariate analysis showed that younger respondents (< 30 years of age) and active and inactive attendees were more likely to report an HIV test compared with non-attendees; men were less likely to report HIV testing. Despite traveling farther for HIV services (median distance = 4.4 km), 77% of those disclosing HIV infection reported HIV care enrollment. Men and younger respondents were less likely to enroll in HIV care. Socioeconomic status was not associated with HIV service use. Distance did not appear to be the major barrier to service receipt. The health and demographic surveillance system data identified patterns of service use that are useful for future program planning."
3845,0.007,7.0,"Adherence to treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with the successful eradication of infection. However, patients often have difficulty adhering to HCV treatment because of factors such as the psychiatric side effects of regimens and social disadvantage. Commonly, health professionals including specialist physicians, nurses, social workers and psychologists work together under a multidisciplinary model of shared-care to support patients' adherence to HCV treatment. In some HCV treatment clinics, shared-care is not always available, or only partially implemented and this has implications for patient adherence. To explore the facilitators of adherence, an interview-based study was conducted in 2012 with a purposive sample of Australian physicians and nurses (N = 20). The findings reveal that when comprehensive shared-care was limited or unavailable, physicians and nurses filled in the gaps by assuming roles outside of their expertise to help patients adhere to HCV treatment. Physicians and nurses applied instrumental support strategies based on psychosocial interventions, namely patient advocacy, pragmatic problem-solving, treatment engagement and emotional support. These strategies were provided by dedicated physicians and nurses to address shortfalls in multidisciplinary shared-care. Although these interventions were reported to assist adherence, there is an increased risk of complications when physicians and nurses move beyond the bounds of their disciplinary training, for example, to assess and manage patients' psychiatric side effects or advocate on their behalf for social services. Future research should measure the effectiveness of instrumental support strategies on HCV treatment adherence, and explore the costs associated with physicians and nurses providing instrumental support in the absence of comprehensive multidisciplinary shared-care."
2071,0.007,7.0,"To assess the association between support group membership, socio-demographic and HIV related factors including knowledge and attitude of illness in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). Seventy-six participants with HIV who were on follow-up management at three non-governmental care and treatment agencies in south western, Nigeria were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their demographic characteristics, duration of awareness of HIV status, medication status, membership of a support group, HIV-related knowledge (including number of workshops/seminars attended, reading of literature), and attitude toward their illness and treatment. Compared to those who did not belong to a support group, (34, 45%), those who did (42, 55%) were significantly more knowledgeable about HIV-related (t=4.02, p=0.00) and also reported more favorable attitudes toward the illness and its treatment (t=3.38, p=0.005). A multiple regression analysis indicated that group membership and a longer period of awareness of HIV infection contributed significantly to illness knowledge and attitudes. Age, sex, years of education, medication status, and employment status did not contribute significantly to these outcome variables. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS who belonged to a support group and had availed themselves of relevant literature were more knowledgeable and positive about their illness than those who did not belong to support groups. HIV/AIDS support group membership is an important component of psycho-social care in HIV/AIDS patients in Nigeria and should be encouraged."
5243,0.007,7.0,"In Waorani communities of the Amazon basin of Ecuador, hepatitis B (HB) surface antigen was found in 14% of asymptomatic persons. The aim of this study was to identify the Waorani population in Ecuador and obtain an epidemiologically adequate coverage of vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) among them. Between February and September 2010, three vaccination campaigns were completed as part of a collaborative activity between the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health and the community leaders in the intervention areas. In addition, in 10 of the 22 Waorani communities, during first contact, a questionnaire about risk factors for HBV infection was administered. A total of 16 Waorani communities were registered before the beginning of this intervention, but during the actual process, six additional communities were identified. In total, 1,251 community members were registered, 92.7% of which received all three doses of the vaccine. Among them, 83% of survey respondents reported having been vaccinated, but only 22% were able to show proof. Only 1% of respondents were intravenous drug users, whereas 22% had at least one tattoo. All self-identified as heterosexual, but only 32% reported using condoms during sexual intercourse. By March 2015, no new cases of HB were been reported in any of the Waorani communities. Herein, we report the importance of intersectoral collaboration to strengthen health interventions in an isolated population like the Waorani area."
3781,0.007,7.0,"Poor adherence remains a major barrier to achieving the clinical and public health benefits of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis was conduct to evaluate how ARV adverse drug reactions may influence ARV adherence. Thirty-nine articles were identified, and 33 reported that ARV adverse drug reactions decreased adherence and six studies found no influence. Visually noticeable adverse drug reactions and psychological adverse reactions were reported as more likely to cause non-adherence compared to other adverse drug reactions. Six studies reported a range of adverse reactions associated with EFV-containing regimens contributing to decreased adherence. Informing HIV-infected individuals about ARV adverse drug reactions prior to initiation, counselling about coping mechanisms, and experiencing the effectiveness of ARVs on wellbeing may improve ARV adherence."
4564,0.007,7.0,"In HIV-infected individuals, coinfection with HBV and/or HCV is common because of shared modes of transmission. It is known that HIV accelerates progression of liver disease and results in increased morbidity and mortality associated with viral hepatitis, but it is less clear if viral hepatitis has a direct effect on HIV. Treatment of viral hepatitis improves outcomes and should be considered in all HIV-infected patients. Treatment of HBV without concurrent treatment of HIV is risky because resistance can occur in both viruses if regimens are not carefully chosen. "
7450,0.007,7.0,"The remarkable advances in interferon-sparing, all-oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment were a highlight of the 2014 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). The backbone of the nucleotide inhibitor sofosbuvir and the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor ledipasvir with an additional third agent (HCV protease inhibitor or HCV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) led to a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate 12 weeks after cessation of treatment of 95% to 100% after only 6 weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate the potential of combination directacting antiviral (DAA) therapy for abbreviated, well-tolerated, and highly effective HCV treatment. Two triple-drug regimens that comprised 12 weeks of an NS5A inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, and a nonnucleoside inhibitor also resulted in SVRs of more than 90% in patients with HCV genotype 1. HIV coinfection does not appear to negatively impact response to DAA-based HCV therapy, as evidenced by similar response rates in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients receiving interferonsparing or -containing regimens. There was continued emphasis at CROI 2014 on non-AIDS complications of HIV infection, specifically cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and bone and endocrine disorders that persist among patients with treated HIV disease and contribute to morbidity and mortality. Finally, new data on novel drugs and combinations for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), patient outcomes using new rapid TB diagnostics, and a short-course TB prevention strategy were presented. "
8318,0.007,7.0,"The relevance of CD4+T-cells, viral load and age in the immunological response to influenza infection and vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals has previously been pointed out. Our study aimed at assessing, in the setting of 2009 A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza vaccination, whether quantification of activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression in blood B-cells may provide additional indications for predicting antibody response to vaccination in HIV-1 infected patients with similar CD4+T-cell counts and age. Forty-seven healthy controls, 37 ART-treated and 17 treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in the study. Blood was collected prior to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination and at 1, 3 and 6 months after vaccination. Antibody titers to A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay while the mRNA expression levels of AID were measured by quantitative real time PCR. Upon B-cell activation in vitro, AID increase correlated to antibody response to the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine at 1 month after vaccination in all individuals. In addition, the maximum expression levels of AID were significantly higher in those individuals who still carried protective levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies after 6 months from vaccination. No correlation was found between CD4+T-cell counts or age at vaccination or HIV-1 viral load and levels of A(H1N1)pdm09 antibodies. Assessing AID expression before vaccination may be an additional useful tool for defining a vaccination strategy in immune-compromised individuals at risk of immunization failure."
3505,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) is entering into its third decade affecting more than 40 million persons on the plane, with an extraordinary incidence in the underdeveloped world, especially in the African continent where more than 25 million are affected, with more than 3 million new yearly infections and where the life expectancy is at 47 years. Although the vaccination is still far away, the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy in the middle of the 90's was an important advance that contributed to converting an infection that previously had a very high rate of short-term mortality into a chronic disease. The neurological complications of this infection vary enormously. They affect any location of the neuroaxis and can appear at any stage of infection. It is not rare that more than one neurological complication exists. Such complications may be a consequence of the infection itself (primary) or related with immune depression accompanying it (secondary). Among the former, dementia associated to HIV and peripheral polyneuropathy stand out. Among the latter, opportunistic viral and fungal infections and lymphoma of the nervous systems stand out. In recent years different tests that help to establish the diagnoses of these entities have been developed, a necessary step to initiate adequate therapies. The immune state of the patient, reflected by the peripheral count of CD4 lymphocytes and serum viral load, helps us to establish the most likely causes of the neurological problems that appear in the context of this infection. We briefly review the most outstanding characteristics of each one of them in this work."
4018,0.007,7.0,"Although HAART has resulted in improved health outcomes for most HIV-infected individuals, liver failure has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people co-infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). In HBV mono-infected individuals, core deletion mutants are associated with more aggressive liver disease. As HIV accelerates HBV liver disease progression, we hypothesized that HIV-HBV co-infected individuals have increased frequency of core mutations including deletions. To test this hypothesis, we have analysed genome-length sequences of HBV DNA from patients both prior to and during antiviral therapy."
3951,0.007,7.0,"To determine the current risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in multiply transfused thalassemia patients, we tested sera from such patients in New York City for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) using radioimmunoassay techniques. Altogether 48 per cent of the patients had either HBsAg (4.5%) or anti-HBs (43.9%) positive sera. The prevalence of these HBV markers was related to both the number of units transfused and the year blood transfusion therapy was begun, although evidence suggested that the latter factor had the greatest influence. Donor HBsAg screening began in New York in 1969, and only one patient first transfused since that time had HBV marker positive serum. Thus, multiply-transfused thalassemia patients now appear to be at little risk of HBV infection from transfusions. Sera were also tested for antibody to the hepatitis A virus (anti-HA) using immune adherence hemaglutination. Anti-HA prevalence was only 4.9 per cent, no greater than rates reported among nontransfused children, providing evidence against a significant role for blood transfusions in hepatitis A virus transmission."
8668,0.007,7.0,"To compare the seroprevalence of and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) among patients attending a public sexually transmitted disease clinic, the authors conducted both voluntary and blinded seroprevalence surveys between June 1989 and August 1990. For the voluntary survey, every twenty-fifth patient attending the clinic for a new problem was invited to receive anonymous testing for HIV antibody. For the blinded survey, sera obtained for syphilis serologies from 2,297 (86%) of the 2,682 patients attending the clinic for a new problem were tested for HIV antibody after all personal identifiers were removed. Of the 946 eligible patients, 631 (66.7%) agreed to participate in the voluntary survey. Black men were significantly less likely to participate than other men and women (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of HIV antibody was 25% greater in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey (15.2% and 11.4%, respectively, p < 0.05). This difference was due primarily to black homosexual/bisexual men, who had a 12.7-fold greater risk of HIV infection in the blinded survey than in the voluntary survey. These results suggest that blinded seroprevalence surveys may provide a better prevalence estimate of HIV infection than voluntary surveys. The greater risk for HIV infection observed among homosexual and bisexual black men, who were tested only in the blinded serosurvey, suggests that efforts to increase voluntary testing for HIV infection in this group should be developed."
7542,0.007,7.0,"Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is an important public health issue, because it may affect the outcome of antiretroviral treatment. The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with TDR mutations defined according to the list of the World Health Organization was investigated among 53 therapy-naïve persons with confirmed recent HIV-1 infection diagnosed in Poland, in the years 2008-2010. Proviral DNA was amplified, sequenced, and screened for the TDR mutations in the pol gene fragments coding for the whole protease and the initial 256 residues of the reverse transcriptase. The frequency of sequences with at least one TDR mutation was 11.3%. In four (7.5%) sequences at least one resistance mutation related to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was identified, and in further two (3.8%) sequences one mutation related to protease inhibitors' resistance was present. The moderate rate of TDR highlights the need for a continuous surveillance and resistance testing among treatment-naïve individuals to optimize treatment effects within a country. "
1495,0.007,7.0,"Minimizing death and ensuring high retention and good adherence remain ongoing challenges for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment programs. We examined whether the addition of community-based accompaniment (characterized by daily home visits from a community health worker, directly observed treatment, nutritional support, transportation stipends, and other support as needed) to the Rwanda national model for antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery would improve retention in care, viral load suppression, and change in CD4 count, relative to the national model alone."
4293,0.007,7.0,"In order to evaluate the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the etiology of chronic liver diseases, paired sera of 143 patients with biopsy-documented chronic hepatitis were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs by radioimmunoassay method. HBsAg was detected in 67.3% of patients with a preceding verified eipsode of acute hepatitis, and in 26.7% of patients with a cryptogenic form of chronic hepatitis. HBsAg was not found in any of patients with alcoholic chronic hepatitis and in only two of 18 patients with other forms of chronic liver disease. No significant difference in the incidence of anti-HBs was observed in all groups of patients. According to previous studies our results confirm the higher prevalence of HBV infection in etiology of chronic persistent and aggressive hepatitis and indicate that this prevalence may be observed especially in Middle and South Italy. The presence of HBsAg in the serum of 37.2% of our patients with cirrhosis compared with 9% of reported cases in North Italy suggest that HBV plays an important role in the etiology of cirrhosis of the liver in our area."

This study investigated the impact of this funding policy on the society and health care system."
1939,0.007,7.0,"Improving health literacy is a necessary intervention for people with chronic health conditions to ensure adherence with long or life therapies and increase participation in self-care. While adherence is a multifactorial process, increasing health literacy among HIV-infected patients at all stages of living with HIV has been shown to improve treatment outcomes. In the era of rapid scale up of HIV care and treatment, little has been done to evaluate the utility of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials for increasing patient health literacy and how patients perceive such materials. Four patient-oriented print IEC brochures in Kiswahili were designed to be read at the clinic waiting areas and also carried home by patients to supplement the knowledge received from routine counselling during clinic visits. Brochures detail antiretroviral therapy and address common myths, side effects, types and management of opportunistic infections, and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected patients to explore patient perceptions of IEC materials in the urban congested HIV care setting of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Groups of participants were recruited from eight public PEPFAR-supported HIV care and treatment centres in the city (N = 50). In this paper we present the results of those focus group discussions and introduce the print IEC materials as a pilot intervention in a Kiswahili-speaking setting where a need for additional health literacy exists. Further evaluation of these materials will follow as the data becomes available."
8433,0.007,7.0,"In order to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in Royal Australian Navy personnel and to formulate policies for their education, screening and vaccination, a voluntary survey was undertaken. Seven hundred and forty-eight subjects completed a questionnaire that provided details of age, sex, rank, ethnic origin, service abroad, length of service, history of tattooing, liver disease and blood transfusions. Serum was assayed by radioimmunoassay for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (antiHBs) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (antiHBc). The presence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection was correlated with ""risk factors"" by means of the chi 2 test of independence. Fourteen (74%) of 19 personnel from the Pacific Islands, Asia and Africa who were excluded from analysis showed one-or-more such markers. The prevalence of any marker of hepatitis B virus infection was 4.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9%-5.9%). The individual markers HBsAg, antiHBs and antiHBc were found in 0.4% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.2%), 3.6% (95% CI, 2.2%-4.9%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 2.5%-5.3%) of subjects, respectively. The annual attack rate was estimated to be less than 1%. Factors which had a significant correlation with an increased prevalence of markers of hepatitis B virus infection included tattooing (especially if this had been performed in Asia), age, the duration of service and service abroad. Based on these data, and given the reduced cost of hepatitis B vaccines, vaccination now is considered worth while. A policy of vaccinating all personnel who may be required for service at sea, and others at risk, now is in effect. Educational programmes that are aimed at minimizing the risk of exposure to hepatitis B and other viral infections have been instituted."
1710,0.007,7.0,"The clinical and laboratory features of six human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections, seen at a county outpatient HIV facility or university outpatient clinic, are reviewed and compared with other reported cases. Atypical mycobacterial skeletal infections are a manifestation of advanced HIV disease, with most cases having CD4 counts < 100/mm3 at the time these infections become clinically apparent. Multiple sites are frequently involved, and concomitant skin infection with the same organism is common, especially with Mycobacterium haemophilum. The incidence of atypical mycobacterial skeletal infection in HIV-infected individuals was significantly higher than in the general county hospital district patient population, whereas the frequency of Myobacterium tuberculosis skeletal infection did not differ significantly between the two populations. The clinician therefore should maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacteria in a patient presenting with skeletal infection in the setting of a markedly depressed CD4 count."
242,0.007,7.0,"To assess the epidemiology of infection with the delta agent associated with hepatitis B virus, sera from 1314 carriers of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 687 patients with hepatitis B collected in 1978-1981 from different regions of Italy were tested for delta antigen and antibody to the antigen (anti-delta), and the characteristics of delta-positive patients were analyzed. Anti-delta was found in each center participating in the study, indicating that delta infection has spread throughout Italy. Its prevalence was higher in carriers in southern Italy and in those with chronic hepatitis. In northern Italy, delta infection predominated among southern emigrants in industrial towns but also among parenteral drug addicts with hepatitis B virus infection. The prevalence of delta markers was variable and generally low in acute hepatitis B, suggesting that in Italy self-limited forms of delta infection occur sporadically or by limited outbreaks. Delta infection appears to be endemic in southern Italy but a new epidemiologic event in northern Italy, where it was probably introduced by southern emigrants and is presently exceeding its ethnic confinement to spread selectively in communities of drug addicts. Presumably, the endemicity of delta is maintained by transmission of this agent from carrier to carrier of the HBsAg."
5380,0.007,7.0,"Although zidovudine (ZDV) is effective in HIV-1-infected patients, the duration of its efficacy may be short when treatment is started in advanced HIV disease. This pilot prospective case-control study was designed to evaluate the combination of ZDV plus didanosine [ddI] compared with ZDV monotherapy as an initial therapeutic strategy. 'Control' patients (ZDV monotherapy) were matched with 'case' patients (ZDV plus ddI combination therapy) according to the presence or absence of AIDS-defining criteria at entry and CD4 cell count. The case patient group consisted of 35 consecutive HIV-1-infected individuals with < or = 300 CD4 cells/mm3, no previous experience of antiretroviral therapy and who accepted treatment with a combination of ZDV plus ddI. The control patient group consisted of 35 consecutive patients with similar characteristics, but who preferred to start treatment with ZDV alone. Control patients received 250 mg ZDV bid and case patients received ZDV at the same dose plus ddI (200 mg bid). Primary study endpoints were virological (serum HIV-1 RNA) and immunological (CD4 cell count) responses. Viral phenotype (syncytium-inducing (SI) or non-syncytium-inducing (NSI)), development of mutations at codons 215, 41 and 74 and clinical progression (new AIDS-defining event or death) were also assessed. Virological and CD4 cell count responses were significantly greater and more sustained in the group treated with ZDV plus ddI than in the control group, with peak responses of -1.2 +/- 0.7 log10 versus -0.3 +/- 0.4 log10 at 1 month (P = 0.0003) and 61 +/- 52 cells/mm3 versus 19 +/- 25 cells/mm3 at 2 months (P = 0.001), respectively. In both groups the percentage of patients developing a mutation at codon 215 was around 80 per cent at 12 months. A mutation at codon 74 was detected in 30 per cent of case patients at 12 months. Five case patients (14 per cent) versus 12 control patients (34 per cent) showed signs of clinical progression (P = 0.09). In a multivariate model, clinical progression was significantly associated with a baseline"
8094,0.007,7.0,"There is a high prevalence of substance abuse and psychiatric disorders among HIV-infected individuals. Importantly, drug and alcohol-use disorders are frequently co-morbid with depression, anxiety and severe mental illness. Not only do these disorders increase the risk of contracting HIV, they have also been associated with decreased highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) utilisation, adherence and virological suppression. The literature evaluating the relationship between substance abuse and HIV outcomes has primarily focused on injection drug users, although there has been increasing interest in alcohol, cocaine and marijuana. Similarly, the mental health literature has focused largely on depression, with a lesser focus on severe mental illness or anxiety. To date, there is little literature evaluating the association between co-occurring HIV, substance abuse and mental illness on HAART uptake, adherence and virological suppression. Adherence interventions in these populations have demonstrated mixed efficacy. Both directly observed therapy and pharmacist-assisted interventions appear promising, as do integrated behavioural interventions. However, the current intervention literature has several limitations: few of these studies are randomised, controlled trials; the sample sizes have generally been small; and co-occurring substance abuse and mental illness has not specifically been targeted in these studies. Future studies examining individual substances of abuse, psychiatric disorders and co-occurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders on HIV outcomes will inform targeted adherence interventions."
2679,0.007,7.0,"Since expression of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2-receptor-alpha (IL-2R-alpha) by lymphocytes is inhibited by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro, we hypothesized that HIV-co-infection among persons with tuberculosis (TB) might impair T-lymphocyte responses to TB via this mechanism. We measured soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha), a surrogate marker of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor I (sTNF-RI) in sera from West African patients categorized into 4 groups: those with TB alone (TB+ HIV-, n = 55), CD4-matched groups with TB and HIV co-infection (TB+ HIV+, n = 50) or HIV infection alone (TB- HIV+, n = 35), and patients with neither disease (TB- HIV-, n = 35). The median level of sIL-2R-alpha was markedly greater in the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL) compared to the TB- HIV- (670 U/mL; P < 0.001) and TB- HIV+ (880 U/mL; P < 0.01) groups. More importantly, the median concentration of sIL-2R-alpha was much lower in the TB+ HIV+ group (855 U/mL) compared to the TB+ HIV- group (1580 U/mL; P < 0.01) despite similar levels of sTNF-RI. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte activation in TB patients is impaired by HIV co-infection and, furthermore, this suppressive effect was independent of numerical depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Impairment to IL-2-signalling might contribute to the profound impact that HIV has had on both the incidence and the clinicopathological manifestations of TB."
1691,0.007,7.0,"Human immune deficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections remain major public health issues globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Impairment of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity by HIV and/or TB infections may limit the host's defences against other pathogens, including the diarrheagenic protozoan Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis, and Entamoeba histolytica. During September-December 2015 a cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and molecular diversity of these enteric parasites among HIV- and/or TB-infected patients at a medical reference centre in Chowke district, southern Mozambique. A total of 99 stool specimens were initially screened by direct microscopy and further confirmed and characterised by molecular methods. DNA sequence analyses of the genes encoding the small subunit ribosomal RNA and the 60-kDa glycoprotein were used for the typing and sub-typing of Cryptosporidium isolates, respectively. G. intestinalis-positive isolates by real-time PCR were subsequently typed at the glutamate dehydrogenase locus. Differential diagnosis of E. histolytica/dispar was achieved by real-time PCR. G. intestinalis (8.1%) was the enteric protozoan more frequently detected, followed by Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), and Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (6.1%). Two HIV-infected (but not TB-infected) patients harbour G. intestinalis and Cryptosporidium spp. co-infections. Two (29%) G. intestinalis isolates were successfully characterised, revealing the presence of known AII and novel BIV genotypes. Four (57%) Cryptosporidium isolates were unmistakeable assigned to C. hominis, identifying two (IbA10G2 and IdA22) sub-types. Cryptosporidium infections were not associated to diarrhoea in HIV-positive patients, probably because improved immune function in the affected individuals due to antiretroviral therapy. G. intestinalis was considered a non-opportunistic pathogen, whereas the presence of E. histolytica could not be confirmed by molecular methods. Based on their common presence in the studied clinical population, we recommend the effective diagnosis and treatment of these enteropathogens for improving the management of HIV and TB patients."
2628,0.007,7.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection has become a chronic illness with associated multimorbidity, and practitioners are faced with an emerging population of HIV-infected patients with evolving needs for advance care planning (ACP), defined as communication between individuals and their proxies to plan for future health care decisions. This article provides a review of original research studies on ACP in HIV-infected adults in the era of antiretroviral therapy (1996-present) from PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Eleven studies conducted between 1996 and 2015 met the selection criteria, with study sizes ranging from 9 to 2864 participants. Most studies consisted of white men in outpatient settings and had poorly defined definitions of ACP. Prevalence of ACP was variable (36%-54% had end-of-life communication, 8%-47% had advance directives). Lack of ACP was most commonly associated with low income, followed by lower severity of illness, low education level, black or Hispanic race, female sex, younger age, injection drug use, and social isolation. Practitioners reported limited time or energy and inadequate preparation or training as barriers to ACP. Existing literature on ACP in the era of antiretroviral therapy is limited, but shows that ACP prevalence in HIV-infected individuals is variable depending on socioeconomic factors, severity of illness, and practitioner resources and training. More research is needed to increase ACP among HIV-infected individuals. "
5876,0.007,7.0,"Many physicians, dentists, and allied health personnel sustain occupational exposures to blood and other body fluids that increase their risk of contracting type B viral hepatitis. Overall, the risk of hepatitis B among persons employed in health-related fields is estimated to be approximately four times that in the general adult population. Studies on the incidence of infection and the prevalence of hepatitis B serologic markers have further defined risk in specific occupational categories and work activities. Physicians and dentists are five to ten times more likely than the general adult population to experience hepatitis B infection. Infection rates ten or more times above the average have often been characteristic of surgeons, patient care personnel in dialysis units and institutions for the mentally handicapped, and clinical laboratory workers having frequent contact with blood samples."
4821,0.007,7.0,"Evaluation of resistance pattern in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Retrospective study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance mutations in patients found viraemic after first-line treatment. HBV viral load was determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction and the substitutions in HBV-DNA were studied by polymerase sequencing test. First line treatment had failed in 12 out of 33 patients (36%) receiving anti-HBV drugs. The 12 patients with persistent viraemia were all lamivudine (LAM) experienced and 7 had a polymerase sequencing test available. LAM substitution mutations L180M + M204V/I were found in six out of seven cases, with an accompanying V173L mutation in three cases. These mutations were also related with changes in HBsAg. The use of potent drugs in the first line anti-HBV therapy may reduce the resistance mutations in the future."
9700,0.007,7.0,"An assay, specifically optimized to evaluate the anti-HIV activity of antiretrovirals by flow cytometry analysis, is described. As widely used anti-HIV agents, zidovudine (AZT), abacavir (ABC), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (DDI), lamivudine (3TC), nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV), and as drugs of recent approval raltegravir (RAL), etravirine (ETR), and rilpivirine (RPV), were utilized as reference drugs. HIV-1 NL4-3 virus was prepared by transfection of HEK293T cells with purified plasmid DNA and quantified by p24 antigen-capture assay. For infection, CEM-GFP cells were exposed to vehicle or to several concentrations of the drugs for 2 hr at 37 °C before HIV-1 NL4-3 was added to each sample. The adsorption was prolonged for 3 hr at 37 °C. After 72 hr of incubation, HIV-induced GFP expression in infected CEM-GFP cells was assessed by flow cytometry analysis and expressed as % positive cells. For comparison, p24 production in supernatants was assessed by a commercial ELISA kit. On the basis of IC50 values, the anti-HIV activity, as assayed by this method, was EFV > 3TC > AZT > NVP > DDI > ABC and ETR > RPV > RAL. The comparison between the IC50 values calculated through flow cytometry and p24 production revealed overlapping results, showing that the optimized protocol of CEM-GFP infection with HIV NL4-3 is a suitable method to perform quantitative, rapid and low-expensive screening tests to evaluate the in vitro effect of new candidate anti-HIV drugs."
6626,0.007,7.0,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two-gene locus cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) +49 and CD86 +1057 were previously reported to influence the outcome of liver transplantation (LT) with respect to allograft acceptance. SNP at CTLA-4 +49 was also suggested to be associated with the individual difference in the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV). However, their influence on the incidence of post-LT HBV reinfection was not clear. With the increasing knowledge of costimulatory mechanisms on LT and host immune response, we designed this study to investigate the relationship between different alleles as well as genotypes at these two locations and HBV reinfection after LT."
2495,0.007,7.0,"To estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among parturients in an area with a high cumulative incidence of AIDS, an HIV seroprevalence study was conducted in 1988 in Los Angeles County. Test results were available from 8485 (86.1%) of the 9860 women delivering at four public hospitals. The test results were linked to demographic and medical information available from routinely collected delivery records. Three specimens were HIV-positive, for a seroprevalence of 3.5 per 10,000. The seropositive women were all Latina. The prevalence of HIV among women delivering at all hospitals in Los Angeles County has been shown to be relatively low compared with that of other metropolitan areas with a high number of AIDS cases, such as New York city, but appears to be even lower among women delivering at public hospitals during this time period. This low prevalence is attributed to the predominance of Latinas, who may have lower levels of infection, among public hospital parturients. The relatively low prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in Los Angeles County may contribute to the overall lower prevalence among women in Los Angeles County compared with those in New York city. This study supplements county-specific data obtained from statewide blinded neonatal testing by providing details on HIV seroprevalence among the catchment populations of public hospitals in Los Angeles County."
4360,0.007,7.0,"Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) used against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) need to be activated intracellularly to their triphosphate moiety to inhibit HIV replication. Intracellular concentrations of these NRTI triphosphates, especially zidovudine triphosphate (ZDV-TP), are relatively low (low numbers of femtomoles per 10(6) cells) in HIV-infected patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, several methods have used either high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or solid-phase extraction (SPE) coupled with radioimmunoassay to obtain in vivo measurements of ZDV-TP. The limit of detection (LOD) by these methods ranged from 20 to 200 fmol/10(6) cells. In this report, we describe the development of a method to determine intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in HIV-infected patients using SPE and HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry for analysis. The LOD by this method is 4.0 fmol/10(6) cells with a linear concentration range of at least 4 orders of magnitude from 4. 0 to 10,000 fmol/10(6) cells. In hispanic HIV-infected patients, ZDV-TP was detectable even when the sampling time after drug administration was 15 h. Intracellular ZDV-TP concentrations in these patients ranged from 41 to 193 fmol/10(6) cells. The low LOD obtained with this method will provide the opportunity for further in vivo pharmacokinetic studies of intracellular ZDV-TP in different HIV-infected populations. Furthermore, this methodology could be used to perform simultaneous detection of two or more NRTIs, such as ZDV-TP and lamivudine triphosphate."
9755,0.007,7.0,"Four hundred and fifty-nine Ethiopian volunteer blood donors were prospectively studied for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Delta agent infections. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 11%, anti-HBs and only anti-HBc 66% and 2%, respectively. Thus, the total HBV infection rate was 79%. There was a single donor with antibody against Delta antigen. The rarity of HBeAg among HBsAg carriers, the lack of occurrence of factors favouring transmission and risk calculations using the available data indicate that post-transfusion hepatitis due to HBV is unlikely to be common in this highly endemic country with very limited financial resources allocated for health services. Thus, we question the validity of indiscriminate screening of all donated blood and we suggest that health policies should emphasize the need for preventive measures."
3241,0.007,7.0,"The resuscitation of a trauma patient is a very hectic and seemingly chaotic situation. The nature of the situation increases the likelihood that a health care worker will receive an accidental needle stick while caring for the patient. There is also a common belief that there is a higher prevalence of communicable bloodborne diseases in the trauma population, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes the greatest amount of fear. This belief of higher prevalence communicable diseases in the trauma population is supported by the literature. We sent blood from our Code One (life-threatening) trauma population for analysis for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies. We found that 0.52% of our trauma population had HIV. We also found that 1.5 per cent had hepatitis B surface antigen, and 13.8 per cent had hepatitis C antibodies. Our prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B is similar to that found in other studies of the trauma populations and higher than the general population. Our hepatitis C prevalence is surprising, considering the very low reported prevalence in the general population. Hepatitis C may be a more significant threat to the health of medical personnel than previously believed."
4117,0.007,7.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates of 8 Ethiopian and 8 Swedish untreated AIDS-patients were examined for their sensitivity to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) and leukocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). No significant difference in drug sensitivity was found between Ethiopian and Swedish isolates, which all were sensitive to AZT, ddI and IFN-alpha except for one Swedish isolate. This isolate exhibited a mutation at amino acid position 215. These results suggest that it should be possible to perform clinical trials in Ethiopia using the same dose regimens as in Sweden."
7695,0.007,7.0,"Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy is an important intervention to prevent the mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV and to promote maternal health. Early initiation of ART is particularly important to achieve viral suppression rapidly before delivery. However, current approaches to start ART in pregnancy may be problematic in many settings, with referrals between antenatal care (ANC) and ART services, and delays for patient preparation before ART initiation. These steps contribute to a sizable proportion of women failing to receive adequate duration of ART before delivery, increasing the risk of MTCT. To address these limitations, we developed the rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy (RAP) programme. The programme featured the use of point-of-care CD4 testing to identify ART-eligible women with CD4 cell counts ≤ 350 cells/µl; immediate ART initiation in women on the same day that eligibility was determined, if possible; and intensive counselling and support for ART initiation during the first few weeks on ART. We implemented RAP in an antenatal clinic setting in Cape Town South Africa. Between February and August 2011, a total of 221 HIV-infected women were referred to the programme for CD4 cell count testing and 101 (46%) were eligible for ART. Of these, 98 women (97%) started therapy during pregnancy, 89 (91%) on the day of referral to the service. In-depth interviews suggested that although there were substantial challenges facing HIV-infected women initiating ART in pregnancy, the availability of immediate services and counselling support played an important role in addressing these. While further research is needed, this evaluation demonstrates that a novel service delivery approach may facilitate rapid ART initiation in pregnancy."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to anaemia and CD4 counts among HIV-infected patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Using a serial sampling method, a total of 2000 HIV-infected patients were recruited on their first visit prior to highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital from August 2007 to August 2009. Stool and blood samples were collected from each patient. The stool samples were processed using the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining technique to microscopically identify the oocysts of Cryptosporidium species, Isospora belli, Cyclospora species and spores of Microsporidium species while saline and iodine preparations were used for identifying the ova, cysts and parasites of Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, Taenia spp and other parasites. The blood specimens were equally analyzed using the flow cytometry for CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and autoanalyzer - sysmex kx - 21 for haemoglobin concentration. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 93.3% while 18% had parasitic infections. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count <200cells/microL and anaemia (P<0.0001). Cryptosporidium species (P= 0.005), A. lumbricoides (P=0.035), hookworm and Taenia species (P=0.014) were associated with anaemia. Anaemia was associated with CD4 count while Cryptosporidium species, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species were the intestinal parasitic agents associated with anaemia. In conclusion the prevalence of anaemia in HIV-infected patients is high low CD4 count is a significant risk factor of acquiring anaemia. Except for isosporiasis, cryptosporidiosis, A. lumbricoides, hookworm and Taenia species in HIV infected individuals are parasitic agents associated with anaemia. Routine screening for intestinal parasites and holistic management of anaemia is advocated."

No large scale U.S. studies have investigated the association between food insecurity and severity of HIV disease or the mechanism of this possible association. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of food insecurity on HIV disease outcomes in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral medications.
8908,0.007,7.0,"Following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration into host cell DNA, the viral promoter can become transcriptionally silent in the absence of appropriate signals and factors. HIV-1 gene expression is dependent on regulatory elements contained within the long terminal repeat (LTR) that drive the synthesis of viral RNAs and proteins through interaction with multiple host and viral factors. Previous studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and Sp site III (3T, C-to-T change at position 3, and 5T, C-to-T change at position 5 of the binding site, respectively, when compared to the consensus B sequence) that are low affinity binding sites and correlate with more advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. Stably transfected cell lines containing the wild type, 3T, 5T, and 3T5T LTRs were developed utilizing bone marrow progenitor, T, and monocytic cell lines to explore the LTR phenotypes associated with these genotypic changes from an integrated chromatin-based microenvironment. Results suggest that in nonexpressing cell clones LTR-driven gene expression occurs in a SNP-specific manner in response to LTR activation or treatment with trichostatin A treatment, indicating a possible cell type and SNP-specific mechanism behind the epigenetic control of LTR activation.

9746,0.007,7.0,"When faced with the ever-increasing demand for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), as well as a variety of fungal, parasitic, and bacterial opportunistic infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, the Chest Service and the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital developed a coordinated plan for the collection and rapid examination of specimens to allow presumptive diagnoses to be made as quickly as possible. Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms."
2946,0.007,7.0,"Vitamin D plays role in bone health and the regulation of the immune system. A cross-sectional study of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels was conducted among HIV-1-infected Thai patients to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vitamin D levels (25[OH]D <30 ng/mL) in tropical setting. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D was measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Of 178 patients, 58% received antiretroviral therapy at median (interquartile range [IQR]) duration of 7.4 (5.9-8.5) years. The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-29.9 ng/mL) was 26.8% and 44.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that receiving efavirenz (EFV) was significantly associated with low vitamin D status (odds ratio = 3.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-12.15, P <.05). The mean (±standard deviation) level of 25(OH)D in patients receiving and not receiving EFV was 22.9 (6.6) and 28.6 (10.7) ng/mL, respectively, (P <.05). Low vitamin D status is common and needs to be assessed among HIV-infected patients including tropical residents especially when EFV is used."
8189,0.007,7.0,"The purpose of this report is to determine the influence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic on medical students' training and career plans through a prospective, anonymous self-administered survey of 10 Likert-scaled (1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree) responses to statements assessing attitude toward patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adequacy of knowledge and experience with HIV, and influence of HIV on career choices. The study was done at a major AIDS referral university teaching hospital. The participants were first- through fourth-year medical students in spring 1990. A 72% (of 451 students) response revealed that both surgery and emergency medicine were perceived as high risk of exposure specialties. Students indicated an overall willingness to care for HIV-positive patients (mean, 2.54) and a general adequacy of knowledge and experience (mean 2.54). The AIDS epidemic has had little influence for training, future career, and practice locations (mean, 4.06). Responses differed by class year. The later class years were more willing to care for HIV patients (P < .001) and indicated more knowledge and experience with HIV (P < .001). Influence on career, training and practice location choices were without class trend. In contrast to some studies, this group of medical students had relatively positive attitudes toward patients with HIV and were not particularly influenced by the AIDS epidemic regarding career choices."
8594,0.007,7.0,"The U.S. military represents a unique population within the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) pandemic. The last comprehensive study of HIV-1 in members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps (Sea Services) was completed in 2000, before large-scale combat operations were taking place. Here, we present molecular characterization of HIV-1 from 40 Sea Services personnel who were identified during their seroconversion window and initially classified as HIV-1 negative during screening. Protease/reverse transcriptase (pro/rt) and envelope (env) sequences were obtained from each member of the cohort. Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on these regions to determine relatedness within the cohort and calculate the most recent common ancestor for the related sequences. We identified 39 individuals infected with subtype B and one infected with CRF01_AE. Comparison of the pairwise genetic distance of Sea Service sequences and reference sequences in the env and pro/rt regions showed that five samples were part of molecular clusters, a group of two and a group of three, confirmed by single genome amplification. Real-time molecular monitoring of new HIV-1 acquisitions in the Sea Services may have a role in facilitating public health interventions at sites where related HIV-1 infections are identified."
596,0.007,7.0,"Little information exists on the frequency, severity, and timing of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug-related adverse events (TB-AEs) in HIV-tuberculosis coinfected (HIV-TB) patients in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. This matched-cohort study included HIV-TB patients as cases and HIV-uninfected tuberculosis (non-HIV-TB) patients as controls. Tuberculosis was culture-confirmed in both groups. Cases were matched to controls in a 1:4 ratio on age, sex, and year of diagnosis. TB-AEs were defined as Grade 2 or higher requiring drug discontinuation/regimen change. From 2003 to 2015, 94 cases and 376 controls were analyzed (95% men, 98% Asians). Standard four-drug combination therapy was initiated in 91% of cases and 89% of controls (p = 0.45). Cases had a higher frequency of TB-AE [51% (48/94) vs. 10% (39/376), p < 0.001]. Their major TB-AEs were fever (19%), rash (11%), and neutropenia (11%). TB-AEs were more severe in cases [Grade 3 or higher: cases (71%, 34/48) vs. controls (49%, 19/39), p < 0.001]. The time from treatment initiation to TB-AE was shorter in cases [median 18 (interquartile range 12-28) vs. 27 (15-57) days, p = 0.027], and 73% of TB-AEs in cases occurred within 4 weeks of starting anti-tuberculosis treatment. HIV infection was an independent risk factor for TB-AEs in the multivariate Cox analysis [adjusted HR (aHR): 6.96; 95% confidence interval: 3.93-12.3]. TB-AEs occurred more frequently in HIV-TB than in non-HIV-TB patients, and were more severe. The majority of TB-AEs occurred within 4 weeks of initiating anti-tuberculosis treatment. Because TB-AEs may delay ART initiation, careful monitoring during this period is warranted in coinfected patients."
1912,0.006,6.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is characterized by the presence of HBV DNA in serum and/or in the liver of patients negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Occult infection may impact in several different clinical contexts including the risk of HBV transmission with transfusion or transplantation, and endogenous viral reactivation. The gold standard test for detection of occult infection is the amplification of HBV DNA. However, the serological assay for the long-lasting antibody response to the highly immunogenic HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) represents a qualified candidate as a surrogate for DNA amplification, or for increasing overall sensitivity when assessing the risk of occult hepatitis in peripheral blood. The risk of occult hepatitis associated with anti-HBc seropositivity has been demonstrated extensively, and the presence of antibody response to HBc can be considered a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection."
6947,0.006,6.0,"The importance of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a subject of debate. This study sought to identify independent risk factors involved in development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in patients with chronic HBV infection who have normal ALT values. Data from 381 consecutive hepatitis B patients were analyzed with average ALT integration values < or = 40 IU/L and follow-up periods of > 3 years. Integration values were calculated from biochemical tests, and serological markers associated with the cumulative incidence of HCC were analyzed. HCC developed in 17 of the 381 patients (4.5%) during the follow-up period. Male sex (hazard ratio, 6.011 [95% confidence interval: 1.353-26.710], P = 0.018), high HBV-DNA levels (> or = 5.0 log copies/ml; 5.125 [1.880-13.973], P = 0.001), low platelet counts (< 15.0 x 10(4)/mm(3); 4.803 [1.690-13.647], P = 0.003), and low total cholesterol levels (< 130 mg/dl; 5.983 [1.558-22.979], P = 0.009) were significantly associated with greater incidence of HCC development. High HBV-DNA levels and low platelet counts are associated with the development of HCC in patients infected with hepatitis B who have normal ALT values. Therefore, maintenance of low HBV-DNA levels is important for the prevention of HCC in patients with low platelet counts, particularly in patients whose ALT values fall within the current normal range."
720,0.006,6.0,"The scarcity of liver donors requires consideration of grafts from sources not previously used. Allografts from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-carriers without a significant liver disease have been proposed for liver transplant recipients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Combination prophylaxis schemes against HBV post-liver transplantation (LT) recurrence are currently available; the efficacy of those schemes in HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC must be assessed. This report describes the allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in three HBsAg-positive recipients, with HBV-related cirrhosis and evolving HCC lesions, two of them with hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) coinfection. Patients were administered anti-hepatitis B immunoglobulins (HBIGs) and lamivudine in order to prevent HBV recurrence. In spite of anti-HBV prophylaxis, HBV infection did persist after LT in all patients (no serum clearance of HBsAg). HBV replication assessed by serum HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) presence was detected in the first month after LT in the 3 recipients. A prompt HDV reinfection with a clinical and histological pattern of hepatitis was observed in the 2 HBV / HDV coinfected recipients. In 1 of them, an evolving chronic hepatitis required a second LT. The non-HDV-infected patient showed an uneventful follow-up, but the lack of the neutralizing effect of HBIGs and the high risk of escape mutants forced the addition of adefovir-dipivoxil to lamivudine, in order to prevent viral variants and hepatitis recurrence. In conclusion, allografts from HBsAg-positive donors in HBsAg-positive recipients are associated with the persistence of the HBsAg after LT due to the failure of HBIG prophylaxis, even if lamivudine does inhibit virion production. This condition favors HDV replication and HDV hepatitis recurrence in coinfected patients. The allocation of HBsAg-positive grafts in HBsAg-positive recipients could be justified only in recipients without HDV coinfection and a combined prophylaxis with lamivudine and adefovir-dipivoxil is currently the best way to manage escape mutants in these recipients."

A cure for the fully developed AIDS related to HIV infection remains elusive, and HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of death among adults between the ages of 25 and 44. Life expectancy, however, has gradually increased over the years, resulting in a concern for a potential increase in the incidence of secondary psychiatric manifestations. Knowledge of the neuropathology of HIV-CNS dysfunction and familiarity with its clinical presentation can aid clinicians in a determination of the appropriate therapy inclusive of psychiatric care that may be useful for a specific individual in their treatment."

The objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with interest in an app to self-manage drinking and to identify differences in baseline mobile technology use among PLWH by drinking level."
7024,0.006,6.0,"Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of genomic DNA from oral isolates of four different Candida species other than C. albicans and atypical chlamydospore-positive isolates from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals and AIDS patients was investigated as a means for differentiating between isolates within individual species. Oligonucleotides composed of simple repetitive sequence motifs, including (GACA)4, (GATA)4, (GGAT)4, (GTG)5, and (GT)8, all yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation of 8 C. tropicalis isolates, 12 Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata isolates, 8 atypical Candida isolates, and, except for (GATA)4, 2 C. krusei probe in turn and so generate several distinct DNA fingerprints of the same DNA sample. However, none of the probes yielded fingerprints suitable for strain segregation with three C. parapsilosis isolates. The (GATA)4 probe was also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms among a genetically closely related group of atypical Candida isolates on primary isolation from an additional HIV-infected patient. These chlamydospore-positive atypical Candida isolates were sucrose positive, were of C. albicans serotype A, hybridized weakly with the C. albicans-specific mid-repeat sequence probe 27A, and yielded fingerprint profiles by random polymorphic DNA analysis that were distinct from those derived from C. albicans isolates. The C. stellatoidea ex-type strain NCPF 3108 was indistinguishable from the atypical Candida isolates in all these tests and also yielded an identical carbohydrate and nitrogen source assimilation profile by using the ID 32C yeast identification system."
6928,0.006,6.0,"The authors examined sexual behaviors, the seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and condom use among 2,314 homosexual and bisexual men tested during 1988-1989 at the AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) National Center in Mexico City. Bisexuals constituted 24% of the sample; the seroprevalence rate was lower for bisexuals than homosexuals (21 vs. 34%). In logistic regressions, HIV-1 seropositivity was independently related to age, education, pattern of insertive/receptive behavior in anal sex, lifetime number of male sex partners, having sex with someone with AIDS, homosexual versus bisexual behavior, and a history of condyloma. The same logistic regressions were found to fit bisexuals and homosexuals. The rate of HIV-1 was reduced in individuals who indicated always requiring their partners to use a condom when practicing receptive anal sex (1% of the total). The most common practice for both homosexuals and bisexuals was ""mixed"" behavior (i.e., both insertive and receptive anal sex); this was also the practice with the highest risk. Bisexuals practiced both vaginal and anal sex with women and reported little condom use. The substantial seroprevalence among bisexuals, their frequent sexual contact with women, and their low rate of condom use imply a continuing role as a bridge of infection to females. Whether this risk will lead to a sustained heterosexual epidemic remains to be determined."
8709,0.006,6.0,"The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with HIV infection among specific population subgroups and complement the HIV surveillance system in Cameroon. Five subgroups (truck drivers, female-sex-workers, university students, health service providers, and residents along Chad-Cameroon petroleum pipeline) were targeted in 2004. Potential participants were approached at their geographically diverse areas and consented to participate in the study. Anonymous blood samples were collected. 4,011 participants were surveyed (35% students, 25% sex-workers, 20% pipeline residents, 12.5% health service providers, 7.5% truck drivers). HIV prevalence was highest among sex-workers [26.4%, (95% CI, 23.6-29.2)], pipeline residents [19.9% (95% CI, 17.1-22.7)] and truck drivers [16.3% (95% CI, 12.3-20.9)] and lowest among health service providers [5.2% (95% CI, 3.4-7.5)] and university students [3.8% (95% CI, 2.9-5.0)]. Risky sexual behaviours were practiced in all subpopulations. Multivariable analysis shows in female-sex-workers that; older age, residing in the grassland region (Northwest and West Provinces) and inconstant condom use were significantly associated with HIV infection. Despite a moderate HIV prevalence in the general Cameroonian population, some subgroups are at much higher risk for HIV transmission and practicing risky sexual behaviours. There is need for expanded prevention and care programs with emphasis on truck drivers, sex-workers and pipeline residents."
3595,0.006,6.0,"The results of a study of screening recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by family physicians are reported. Of 209 family practice residents and clinical faculty from the four UCLA-affiliated family practice residency programs surveyed, 110 (53%) responded. Each physician was presented with an identical set of five clinical scenarios and asked to make an HIV screening decision in each case. The physicians were also asked to choose from a list of 11 physician roles the one role that best described why they chose to recommend or not recommend an HIV screening test in each particular scenario. Marked variation was observed among the physicians' HIV screening recommendations. The degree of variation was similar between residents and clinical faculty. The physicians predominantly cited concern for the patient's well-being over concern for the public's well-being in making their HIV screening decisions. Three physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, (2) to protect the unborn from disease, and (3) to optimize the patient's future health care, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was recommended. Two physician roles, (1) to protect the patient from mental suffering, and (2) to allocate limited health resources properly, were the roles most cited when an HIV screening test was not recommended."
7981,0.006,6.0,"We examined attitudinal and demographic correlates of antiretroviral acceptance and adherence among incarcerated HIV-infected women. Structured interviews were conducted with 102 HIV-infected female prisoners eligible for antiretroviral therapy. Three quarters of the women were currently taking antiretroviral agents, of whom 62% were adherent to therapy. Satisfaction was very high with the HIV care offered at the prison; 67% had been first offered antiretroviral agents while in prison. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed acceptance of the first offer of antiretroviral therapy to be associated with trust in medication safety, lower educational level, and non-black race. Current acceptance of therapy was associated with trust in the medication's efficacy and safety. Medication adherence was correlated with the patient-physician relationship and presence of emotional supports. Nearly one half of these HIV-seropositive women were willing to take experimental HIV medications in prison. This was correlated with satisfaction with existing health care, the presence of HIV-related social supports, and perceived susceptibility to a worsening condition. Acceptance and adherence with antiretroviral agents appear to be significantly associated with trust in medications, trust in the health care system, and interpersonal relationships with physicians and peers. Development of models of care that encourage and support such relationships is essential for improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy, especially for populations that have historically been marginalized from mainstream medical care systems."
4852,0.006,6.0,"To investigate the influence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection on preexisting long-term chronic C hepatitis (HCV) 68 liver biopsies from 22 HIV/HCV-coinfected, 13 HIV- and 33 HCV-monoinfected patients and 71 livers obtained at autopsy from 26 HIV/HCV-coinfected and 45 HIV-monoinfected patients were studied by histo- and immunohistochemistry. All HIV patients had reached the advanced stage of immunodeficiency (stage III CDC), except for 3 haemophilias (stage II CDC). HCV infection was associated with a higher degree of portal, periportal and lobular inflammation-regardless of whether there was concurrent HIV infection. HIV/HCV coinfection was associated with a significantly higher rate of granulocytic cholangiolitis than HCV and HIV monoinfection (P < 0.05), a histological feature uncommon in C hepatitis. In HIV/HCV coinfection cholestasis was a predominant histological feature. HCV monoinfection and HCV/HIV coinfection were associated with the highest fibrosis index. In HIV/HCV coinfection centrilobular fibrosis was significantly more marked than in HCV monoinfection (P < 0.05), suggesting an HIV-associated fibrogenic effect. Patients with chronic C hepatitis showed a significantly increased rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis compared with the patients without HCV infection (P < 0.05). At autopsy, 10 of the 20 HIV/HCV-coinfected haemophiliacs had developed cirrhosis because of chronic C hepatitis, whereas cirrhosis was found in only 2 of 6 HIV/HCV-coinfected non-haemophiliacs (1 case of chronic B and C hepatitis, and 1 case of chronic alcohol abuse). No cirrhosis was observed in the 45 autopsy patients with HIV monoinfection. The findings suggest that HIV coinfection aggravates the course of preceding long-term chronic C hepatitis by a more marked (centrilobular) fibrosis. HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are threatened by a higher rate of posthepatitic cirrhosis-particularly in multitransfused haemophiliacs-and cholestatic hepatopathy."

3490,0.006,6.0,"Viral quasispecies analysis is important for basic and clinical research. This study was designed to detect hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome-wide mutation profiling with detailed variant composition in individual patients, especially quasispecies evolution correlating with liver disease progression. We characterized viral populations by massively parallel pyrosequencing at whole HBV genome level in 17 patients with advanced liver disease (ALD) and 30 chronic carriers (CC). An average sequencing coverage of 2047× and 687× in ALD and CC groups, respectively, were achieved. Deep sequencing data resolved the landscapes of HBV substitutions and a more complicated quasispecies composition than previously observed. The values of substitution frequencies in quasispecies were clustered as either more than 80% or less than 20%, forming a unique U-shaped distribution pattern in both clinical groups. Furthermore, quantitative comparison of mutation frequencies of each site between two groups resulted in a spectrum of substitutions associated with liver disease progression, and among which, C2288A/T, C2304A, and A/G2525C/T were novel candidates. Moreover, distinct deletion patterns in preS, X, and C regions were shown between the two groups. In conclusion, pyrosequencing of the whole HBV genome revealed a panorama of viral quasispecies composition, characteristics of substitution distribution, and mutations correlating to severe liver disease.

5074,0.006,6.0,"HIV-1 resistance mutations to antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NRTI; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, NNRTI; and protease inhibitors, PI) represent a challenge for sustainable virologic and immunologic responses. HIV-1 phylogenetic diversity and ARV resistance mutations associated with protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were assessed among 48 ARV-experienced patients from Goiania/Goias, central west Brazil. The gp41 resistance mutations to the fusion inhibitor (T-20) were analyzed among multidrug-resistant (MDR) patients. PR, partial RT, and gp41 genes were amplified and sequenced from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. ARV mutations in PR/RT were analyzed by the Stanford Database. T-20 resistance mutations in gp41 were identified by Stanford, the Los Alamos Database, and other sources. Subtype B represented 79.2% (38/48), subtype F1 4.2% (2/48), subtype C 2.1% (1/48), F1(PR)/B(RT) 8.3% (4/48), and B(PR)/F1(RT) 6.3% (3/48). Secondary drug resistance was observed in 79% (38/48): NRTI resistance (n = 1), NNRTI resistance (n = 1), PI + NRTI or NRTI + NNRTI resistance (n = 20), and PI + NRTI +NNRTI resistance, considered MDR (n = 16). Almost half of the MDR patients had viral loads below 10,000 copies/ml. The gp41 sequences from 14 MDR revealed one F1(PR)/B(RT)/F1(ENV) recombinant and 13 subtype B(PR)/B(RT)/B(ENV) isolates. G36E, N42T, and N43S T-20 resistance mutations were observed in three MDR patients, two of them previously treated with T-20 and the other who had never used T-20. Our data among ARV-experienced patients showed a high proportion of drug-resistance mutations and MDR. T-20 resistance mutations were detected among MDR patients corroborating the importance of T-20 genotyping for clinical management and salvage therapy."
5427,0.006,6.0,"Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimens have recently been used in HIV-1 infected children in resource-limited settings. Treatment failure with this regimen has become more common. A second regimen needs to be prepared for the Thai national program. Genotypic resistance testing was conducted among HIV-1 infected children who experienced virological failure with antiretroviral therapy (ART) using NNRTI-based regimens. Patterns of resistance mutations were studied and options for a second regimen were determined. There were 21 patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.1 (1.9-7.7) years. Sixteen patients were males. The median CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA at the time of virological failure were 647 cells/mm3 and 5.3 log copies/ml, respectively. The prevalences of patients with > or =1 major mutation conferring resistance to NRTIs and NNRTIs were 52% and 43%, respectively. Thymidine analoque mutations, M184V/I, and Q151M were observed in 38%, 33%, and 5%. The patterns of resistance mutations suggest that 48% of patients need a protease inhibitor-based regimen for the second regimen and didanosine+lamivudine is the most required nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone."
1795,0.006,6.0,"Wasting and food insecurity are commonly seen in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, and supplementary feeding is often offered in conjunction with ART. Evidence for the effectiveness of such supplementary feeding is scant. A randomised, investigator-blinded, controlled clinical trial of two types of supplementary food, corn/soy blended flour and a ready-to-use peanut butter-based lipid paste, in wasted adults in Blantyre, Malawi is described and the results summarised. A historical control group who did not receive supplementary food is described as well. Provision of about half of the daily energy requirement as a supplementary food for 14 weeks resulted in more rapid restoration of a normal BMI; and the energy-dense, ready-to-use paste was associated with more rapid weight gain than the blended flour. Survival was similar among the 3 groups. The strong association between lower BMI and survival indirectly suggests that there may well be clinical benefit from supplementary feeding in this population. No differences were seen in ART adherence or quality of life with more rapid restoration of BMI. Further research is urgently needed concerning the widespread practice of supplementary feeding in HIV/AIDS care to most effectively utilize this intervention."
2462,0.006,6.0,"Six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-1/2 immunoassays, including five enzyme immunoassays and one rapid test, were challenged with up to 250 serum samples collected from various global sites. The serum samples were from individuals known to be infected with variants of HIV-1 including group M subtypes A, B, B', C, D, E, F, and G and group O. All immunoassays detected the vast majority of samples tested. Three samples produced low signal over cutoff values in one or more tests: a clade B sample, an untypeable sample with a low antibody titer, and a group O sample. It is concluded that HIV-1 immunoassays used in the United States are capable of detecting most HIV-1 group M variants."
921,0.006,6.0,"Cellular responses against hepatitis C virus (HCV) are impaired in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients showing uncontrolled viral replication and immune suppression. Very few studies have explored to what extent HCV-specific response improves as a consequence of control of HIV replication by highly active antiretroviral therapy. We compared HCV-specific T-cell responses between HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, showing complete viral suppression, and HCV-monoinfected patients."
4941,0.006,6.0,"Outcomes of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are varied, with increased morbidity reported in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. The factors driving different outcomes are not well understood, but there is increasing interest in an HLA class I effect. We therefore studied the influence of HLA class I on HBV in an African HIV-positive cohort. We demonstrated that virologic markers of HBV disease activity (hepatitis B e antigen status or HBV DNA level) are associated with HLA-A genotype. This finding supports the role of the CD8(+) T-cell response in HBV control, and potentially informs future therapeutic T-cell vaccine strategies. "
1962,0.006,6.0,"Several infectious agents have been associated with development of lymphoproliferative disorders. Among these is hepatitis C virus (HCV), which infects more than 200 million people worldwide. HCV infection has been linked to progression of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) syndrome and has also been suggested to contribute to development of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Mechanisms responsible for development of lymphoproliferative disorders among HCV-positive patients remain unclear. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which chronic stimulation of B-cells by antigens associated with HCV infection causes nonmalignant B-cell expansion that may evolve into B-cell NHL. The course of disease among HCV-positive B-cell NHL patients may be complicated by coinfection with other infectious agents. This possibility has been explored by studies that have investigated potential interactions between HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as between HCV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Further characterization of the mechanisms by which HCV promotes development of lymphoproliferative disorders may improve diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these conditions."
1165,0.006,6.0,"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging."
3377,0.006,6.0,"Osteoporosis is increasingly reported in the aging HIV-positive population, and co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) may further increase the risk of osteoporosis. However, it remains unclear whether HCV-related increased fracture risk is a function of the severity of liver disease. We calculated the time-updated alanine aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score (an indirect marker of hepatic fibrosis) in all HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs' Clinical Case Registry between 1984 and 2009. The association between HCV co-infection and incident osteoporotic fracture (defined as closed wrist, vertebral, or hip fracture) was assessed in univariate and multivariate Cox survival models adjusting for traditional risk factors for osteoporosis and APRI score or the presence of cirrhosis. A total of 772 osteoporotic fractures were identified among 56,660 HIV-infected patients (98.1% male; 31.3% HCV co-infected; median age 44.0 years) contributing 305,237 patient-years of follow-up. Fracture rates were significantly higher among HIV/HCV patients than HIV-only patients (2.57 versus 2.07/1000 patient-years, relative risk = 1.24, p < 0.0001). In a Cox multivariable model including age, race, smoking, drug use, body mass index, and antiretroviral therapy, HCV co-infection remained an independent predictor of osteoporotic fractures after controlling for presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32; p <0.001) or APRI score (HR = 1.30; p = 0.003). Among HIV/HCV co-infected patients, cirrhosis strongly predicted osteoporotic fractures (HR = 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-2.44; p = 0.012), but APRI score was a weaker predictor (HR = 1.008; 95% CI 1.002-1.014; p = 0.015). In conclusion, among HIV-infected patients, severity of liver disease partly explains the HCV-associated increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Other determinants of this increased risk remain to be defined."
8178,0.006,6.0,"In the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease has emerged as an important cause of death among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of liver disease and evaluate determinants of liver fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity among HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving ART. We studied 112 randomly selected and 98 referred HCV-infected patients undergoing care in the Johns Hopkins University HIV clinic. Liver disease was characterized clinically and histologically. Of the 210 individuals studied--64% of whom had received ART within 2 years of liver disease assessment--33% had no fibrosis (F0), and 26% had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (> or =F3). The median necroinflammatory activity score was 3 (range, 0-9 of 18). ART was not associated with fibrosis; however, significantly less hepatic necroinflammatory activity was observed among persons who had received highly active antiretroviral therapy longer (P = .02) and more effectively (defined by HIV RNA suppression; P < .01). Twelve percent of individuals had previous ART-associated liver enzyme elevations (grades 3-4), but liver fibrosis was not more severe if the liver enzyme elevation resolved. On the other hand, liver fibrosis was more severe in persons with persistent liver enzyme elevations (grades 1-4). In conclusion, despite widespread exposure to ART and documented instances of ART-related hepatitis, we found no evidence that ART caused serious histological liver disease. Recognition of bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis in some but not most patients underscores the importance of identifying and treating liver disease in HIV/HCV coinfected persons."
7356,0.006,6.0,"The characteristics of intra-host human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env evolution were evaluated in untreated HIV-1-infected subjects with different patterns of disease progression, including 2 normal progressor [NP], and 5 Long term non-progressor [LTNP] patients. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the C2-C5 env gene sequences of the replicating HIV-1 was performed in sequential samples collected over a 3-5 year period; overall, 301 HIV-1 genomic RNA sequences were amplified from plasma samples, cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Firstly, the evolutionary rate was calculated separately in the 3 codon positions. In all LTNPs, the 3rd codon mutation rate was equal or even lower than that observed at the 1st and 2nd positions (p = 0.016), thus suggesting strong ongoing positive selection. A Bayesian approach and a maximum-likelihood (ML) method were used to estimate the rate of virus evolution within each subject and to detect positively selected sites respectively. A great number of N-linked glycosylation sites under positive selection were identified in both NP and LTNP subjects. Viral sequences from 4 of the 5 LTNPs showed extensive positive selective pressure on the CD4-binding site (CD4bs). In addition, localized pressure in the area of the IgG-b12 epitope, a broad neutralizing human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD4bs, was documented in one LTNP subject, using a graphic colour grade 3-dimensional visualization. Overall, the data shown here documenting high selective pressure on the HIV-1 CD4bs of a group of LTNP subjects offers important insights for planning novel strategies for the immune control of HIV-1 infection."
1910,0.006,6.0,"Few empirical studies have evaluated the mediating effects of quality of life (QoL) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The purposes of this study were to identify the predictors of QoL and to test the mediating effects of social support on depression and QoL among patients enrolled in an HIV case-management program in Taiwan. A cross-sectional, descriptive correlation design collected data from 108 HIV-infected individuals. Individuals were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II, the short version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support between September 2007 and April 2010. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (including age, gender, and mode of transmission) and clinical information (including CD4 count and time since diagnosis with HIV), the study findings showed that QoL was significantly and positively correlated with both social support and the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and was negatively correlated with depression and time since diagnosis with HIV. The strongest predictors for QoL were depression followed by the initiation of HAART and social support, with an R(2) of 0.40. Social support partially mediated the relationship between depression and QoL. Health professionals should enhance HIV-infected individuals' social support to alleviate the level of depression and further increase the QoL among PLWHA."
4794,0.006,6.0,"Treatment strategies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive active injecting drug users (IDUs) must take into account their lifestyles, that often result in low adherence to therapy. The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) offer simpler treatment regimens, but the appearance of drug resistance during treatment failure may cause high levels of cross-resistance to all NNRTIs. We adopted a combination therapy of two NRTIs and nevirapine (NVP) for treatment of IDU patients to evaluate its feasibility in such patients. From October 1998 to December 1999, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 80 IDUs on this regimen were collected. Fisher's exact test, Kaplan Meier method, and Cox model were used for statistical analysis. Overall, 20 IDUs discontinued the treatment because of side effects and 20 IDUs experienced treatment failure. Considering the treatment failure as an end point, 55.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 37.9%-72.6%) of patients was still undergoing treatment after 12 months compared to 44.6% (31.8%-58.6%) when discontinuation was also taken into account. An increasing trend over time was observed in the CD4+ lymphocyte count, among failing and nonfailing IDUs. By multivariate analysis, baseline HIV-RNA, treatment breaks and low adherence and active injecting drug use turned out to be significantly associated with treatment failure. Our results show that continuing injecting drug use and treatment breaks are the main factors that can lead to treatment failure in IDUs and easily to NNRTI class resistance."
255,0.006,6.0,"A patient with HIV infection developed the first episode of AIDS-defining opportunism (severe Candida albicans esophagitis) with an underlying CD4+ lymphocyte count of 1,025 cells/microL. After treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), taken with insufficient compliance and leaving a residual viral load, our patient suffered from two relapses of esophageal candidiasis, which occurred three months and seven years later, when his CD4+ lymphocyte count was 930 and 439 cells/microL, respectively, and a viral load slightly above 10(4) copies/mL was still present. Also in the HAART era, Candida esophagitis remains one of the most common AIDS-defining diseases, but a presentation with a concurrent CD4+ count above 1,000 cells/microL remains a rare exception, as well as the two isolated, subsequent relapses, occurred with a CD4+ count ranging from 439 to 930 cells/microL, and a residual HIV viremia due to insufficient adherence to the prescribed HAART regimens. Our case report represents the opportunity to revisit the epidemiology and, especially, the pathogenesis of this opportunistic fungal complication in HIV-infected patients and in other subjects at risk, on the ground of an extensive literature review, and to explore possible alternative supporting factors other than the crude absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, with emphasis on the possible role of a persisting HIV viremia, and other potential contributing factors. Clinicians engaged with immunocompromised patients and subjects with HIV disease, should be aware that a Candida esophagitis may occur and relapse also when the cell-mediated immunity, as measured by a simple CD4+ cell count, do not show relevant abnormalities."
896,0.006,6.0,"In February and in June 1998, two people developed acute hepatitis B following in-patient care in a district general hospital. Initial enquiries indicated their infections were not attributable to staff undertaking exposure-prone procedures (EPPs). We report the findings and implications of the subsequent investigation: a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency investigation, including molecular epidemiological analysis. Occupational Health records showed that staff involved in EPPs with the patients were HBsAg negative. No contact between the patients was identified nor were there failures in sterilization. The patients' HBV strains were identical, indicating a common source. A total of 231 out of 232 staff who might have treated either patient were tested for HBsAg; the remaining doctor, working abroad, was HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive and had the same HBV strain as the patients. On two occasions the doctor's hand had been cut while breaking glass vials, but there was no documentation linking these events to the two patients. The doctor had been vaccinated in 1993 and tested for anti-HBs prior to commencing work in 1997. The doctor was recalled to Occupational Health but did not attend and was not followed up. In total, 4948 patients potentially treated by the doctor received an explanatory letter and 3150 were tested for HBsAg. Only one was positive, and HBV sequencing showed no link to the doctor. Occasionally transmission of HBV from heath-care workers can occur in a non-EPP setting and the implications of this require examination by those setting national policy. Occupational Health Services should investigate clinical heath-care workers who do not respond to vaccination. They should ensure HBV carriers are identified and offer them appropriate advice to prevent transmission to patients."
2510,0.006,6.0,"HIV-2 infection is confined mostly to West Africa. Seven HIV-2 subtypes have so far been described; only HIV-2 subtypes A and B are prevalent, the others being considered self-limiting infections at the epidemiological level. The main limitation for the HIV-2 DNA proviral quantification is the lack of HIV-2 DNA standard. We designed and tested a new HIV-2 primer couple that amplifies both the HIV-2 ROD strain and HIV-1 LAV/BRU strain. These HIV-2 primers were used to quantified an HIV-2 standard comparatively to a standard widely used in proviral DNA HIV-1 quantification, i.e., the 8E5 cell line transfected by a single defective integrated provirus of HIV-1 BRU/LAV by cell. The primers and probe used to quantify HIV-2 DNA are located in a long terminal repeat (LTR) region with low variability. These primers amplify both HIV-2 subtypes A and B. The relevance of the follow-up of the infected patients by the quantification of the proviral DNA HIV-2 is currently studied."
8861,0.006,6.0,"In 1994, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) recommended the use of zidovudine (ZDV) to reduce perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission; in 1995, USPHS recommended universal prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing. Widespread implementation of these recommendations, together with increased use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and scheduled cesarean delivery, has resulted in substantial declines in perinatal HIV transmission. However, perinatal HIV transmission continues to occur. To identify missed prevention opportunities, CDC analyzed the incidence of perinatal HIV infection among a cohort of HIV-exposed infants born during 1997-2000 at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, Georgia. This report describes the results of that analysis and underscores the challenges to universal prevention of infant HIV infections. Efforts to reduce perinatal HIV transmission should focus on increasing prenatal care rates, promoting adherence to recommended treatment regimens during pregnancy, and increasing prenatal HIV testing, particularly in areas where missed opportunities for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission persist."
6098,0.006,6.0,"We carried out a cross-sectional survey in Shiraz to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1 444 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We also determined the risk factors for this coinfection. Demographic and behavioural data were obtained using a standard questionnaire. The prevalence of HIV-HCV coinfection was 78.4% (95% CI: 76.3-80.5). Intravenous drug use (OR = 7.2; 95% CI: 4.9-10.6), imprisonment (OR = 6.9; 95% CI: 4.6-10.4), tattooing in prison (OR = 2.61; 95% CI: 1.4-4.8), tattooing out of prison (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.1) and age (OR = 1.02 with increasing each year of life; 95% CI: 1.0-1.04) were significantly associated with HCV-HIV coinfection. Prevalence of HCV-HIV coinfection is high in Shiraz. Intravenous drug use and imprisonment are the main risk factors for this coinfection. Therefore, serious implementation of HIV and HCV testing, education, prevention, care and treatment programmes and evaluation of harm reduction programmes in prisons are very important."
4476,0.006,6.0,"Retroviral genomes with a high frequency of G-->A mutations are thought to originate during reverse transcription (RT). Here we present a case report of an AIDS patient infected with a subtype F variant where extensive G-->A hypermutation (G-->A Hypm) sequences were found in the protease gene. This patient was failing HAART at the time the hypermutation was found. These sequences were basically encountered in the proviral compartment on two occasions and were persistently absent in the plasma viral population. The patient's viral genotype showed several mutations related to antiretroviral drug resistance in RT (T69N, M184V, T215F, K219Q) and protease (M36I, G48V, I54V, T63L, V82A) genes. The drug regimen was changed and the viral load dropped 0.9 Logs and CD4 count increased by 200 cells/ml. The hypermutation was not found any more in a 1-year follow up. The patient's wife was infected with a similar virus strain and G-->A Hypm sequences were also detected in the RT gene. This is the first report of sexual transmitted G-->A Hypermutation in HIV-1 and suggest that this phenomenon can be genetically coded by the viral RT molecule."

3307,0.006,6.0,"During the last 5 years, considerable scientific and financial efforts have been made in the development of quantitative nucleic acid detection technology. For detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), quantitative culture is time consuming, cumbersome and requires appropriate laboratory safety equipment. Quantitative determination of p24 antigen by enzyme immunoassay is of limited value due to its relatively poor sensitivity. Therefore, quantitative determination of viral load using nucleic acid amplification techniques is the most accurate, prognostic marker for HIV type 1 infection, independently of the CD4+ cell count. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is not cultivable in vitro. Serological assays allow an accurate diagnosis and follow-up of acute or chronic infection. Quantification of HBV DNA is used for the monitoring of antiviral therapy, determination of infectivity and for resolution of unclear serological profiles, e.g. isolated anti-HBc reactivity, as well as for patients in which HBV mutants are suspected. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can only be detected by molecular based assays because no cell culture system, which permits a reliable isolation of clinical specimens, is currently available. Furthermore, early diagnosis and follow-up of infection cannot be achieved with antibody serology. The prognostic relevance of quantitative HCV RNA determination is of limited value for the long-term prognosis of chronic hepatitis C. However, viral load may predict the outcome of antiviral therapy. Genetic diversity is another challenge for HCV RNA quantification."
9090,0.006,6.0,"A synthetic peptide, RPI 312, that specifically inhibits the protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) showed a potent inhibition on virus production, maturation, and infectivity. Treatment with this agent prevented the cleavage of Gag protein at the site between p17 and p24 in HIV-1 chronically infected MOLT-4 cells as well as in the released virus. Passage of HIV-1 in the presence of gradually increasing concentrations of this protease inhibitor resulted in emergence of a variant that could evade the drug effects. In the resistant variant the maturation of Gag proteins appeared normal, but its infectivity was reduced compared with that of the parent virus. The nucleotides coding the amino acids at and around the cleavage site between Gag proteins p17 and p24 were not changed. One point mutation (A-->G) at site 2082 of the pol gene that resulted in one amino acid change at site 84 of the protease from isoleucine to valine (I-84-->V) could be detected in the resistant variant. An HIV-1 infectious DNA clone with the I-84-->V mutation also showed reduced sensitivity to this protease inhibitor. The findings that the resistant variant had lower infectivity and was still affected by higher doses of the drug support the speculation that resistance to protease inhibitors may not be as problematic as other drug resistance."
5432,0.006,6.0,"Clinical observation shows pregnant women under antiretroviral therapy present bleeding episodes at delivery, although this therapy promotes a decrease in fibrinolysis in nonpregnant patients, suggesting a prothrombotic state in the former. Since these drugs provoke hepatic disorders, they can cause bleeding disturbances. We investigated effects of antiretroviral therapy on hemostasis in pregnant women. Two groups were studied: pregnant women with HIV (n = 11), and (control) pregnant women without HIV (n = 7). Four blood samples were collected from each individual in both groups: one at the beginning of pregnancy before treatment, two during pregnancy and therapy, and one 6 weeks after delivery. Treatment was performed according to recommendations of the Brazilian Health Department for the evaluation of the prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, factors VII, X, and XII, fibrinogen concentration, protein C, protein S, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and fibrin degradation products (FbDPs). Statistical analysis demonstrated pregnancy caused increased factor VII (P = 0.0313), factor X (P = 0.0156) and factor XII (P = 0.0156) activity, fibrinogen concentration (P = 0.0156), t-PA (P = 0.0313), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P = 0.0156) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0313). HIV infection caused increased factor XII (P = 0.0114), t-PA (P = 0.0346) and FbDPs (P = 0.0003), and decreased protein S levels (P = 0.0441). Antiretroviral therapy reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (P = 0.0114) and protein S (P = 0.0012), and increased t-PA (P = 0. 0204) and FbDP levels (P = 0.0154). The results suggest a prothrombic state developing during pregnancy, maintenance of hemostatic equilibrium in HIV infection and occurrence of hyperfibrinolysis, not due to hepatotoxicity, during antiretroviral therapy, causing the clinically observed bleeding episodes."
4844,0.006,6.0,"A major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a pool of long-lived, latently infected CD4+ memory T-cells. The search for treatments to re-activate latent HIV to aid in clearance is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that lead to transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression in host cells. Here we identify a previously unknown role for RUNX1 in HIV-1 transcriptional latency. The RUNX proteins, in combination with the co-factor CBF-β, are critical transcriptional regulators in T-cells. RUNX1 strongly modulates CD4 expression and contributes to CD4+ T-cell function. We show that RUNX1 can bind DNA sequences within the HIV-1 LTR and that this binding represses transcription. Using patient samples we show a negative correlation between RUNX1 expression and viral load. Furthermore, we find that pharmacologic inhibition of RUNX1 by a small molecule inhibitor, Ro5-3335, synergizes with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) to enhance the activation of latent HIV-1 in both cell lines and PBMCs from patients. Our findings indicate that RUNX1 and CBF-β cooperate in cells to modulate HIV-1 replication, identifying for the first time RUNX1 as a cellular factor involved in HIV-1 latency. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of RUNX1 to re-activate virus and aid in clearance of HIV-1. "
4789,0.006,6.0,"Two very rare case reports of bladder transitional cell carcinoma associated with HIV infection in patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy are described, and discussed on the ground of the most relevant and updated literature resources. Only 13 cases of vesical carcinoma have been reported to date in the setting of HIV infection, but only 3 anecdotal single reports (the last in the y 2001) described clinical, therapeutic, and outcome issues of this rare disease association in some detail. In our patients, micro- or macro-haematuria was the clue for in-depth diagnosis and prompt treatment, which was limited to multiple local interventions in 1 case, but finally required a radical cystectomy in the second patient. No relationship was found with the very favourable underlying HIV-related virological and immunological status, and the present 8-12-month follow-up did not show disease relapses."
6193,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may either emerge in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) as a result of positive selection pressure exerted by their own immune response, or during therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs). Naturally occurring HBV variants with primary antiviral resistance are rarely observed. The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the (eventual) circulation of HBV variants with natural resistance to NAs currently used as therapy for CHB in Argentina. This study reports 13 cases of CHB-infected patients with natural antiviral resistance to at least one NA. Five of them were also carriers of S-variants that might escape the humoral immune system recognition with potential resistance to adefovir. In addition to the already reported A2 HBV subgenotype association to NAs natural resistance, E and F genotypes association to such resistance is described for the first time. These findings suggest that sequence analysis of the HBV reverse transcriptase might be an essential tool before starting antiviral therapy, in order to choose the proper NAs for optimizing the therapeutic management of chronically infected patients. Moreover, the circulation and transmission of S-mutants with resistance to such antiviral drugs should be of public health concern as they may represent an additional risk for the community."
9895,0.006,6.0,"Previous studies have suggested that hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants may account for the presence of HBV DNA in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative patients (occult HBV infection). However, it is not known how widespread these variants are and how they influence the course of liver disease. To determine the prevalence of variants within the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBsAg, we investigated 2,565 subjects, including subjects with chronic hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hemodialysis patients, and blood donors. Fifty-one of them had occult HBV infection. The entire S gene from 46 of these patients was sequenced from amplified serum HBV DNA. Forty-three percent (20 of 46) had mutations in the MHR of HBsAg. Thirty-two amino acid substitutions between positions 100-160 of the MHR of HBsAg were detected in 18 patients, and these ranged from 1 to 4 per patient. These changes involved 11 positions inside and 5 outside of the historical first and second loops of the ""a"" determinant, and included the following: Q101K, T115A, K122N, T123A, T126N, Q129N, G130R, T131I, M133T, F134L, C138Y, K141E, P142S, G145R, N146S, and C147F/R. Combinations of mutations were detected in 9 patients, and 7 of these have not been described before. Two further patients had insertion mutations immediately before the ""a"" determinant. Monoclonal antibody binding tests with the Royal Free hepatitis B surface (RFHBs) panel of antibodies revealed decreased immunoreactivity in 6 novel variants of HBsAg. The existence of patients with occult HBV infection caused by HBsAg variants, therefore, has implications for their possible transmission through sexual contact and by blood transfusion."
5087,0.006,6.0,"Live virus vaccines can cause serious adverse reactions when administered to immunocompromised patients. Because children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be immunosuppressed, immunization of these children with live virus vaccines is a potential problem. A retrospective survey was conducted by the New York City Department of Health, with consultation from the Centers for Disease Control, to evaluate the frequency of serious adverse events following receipt of live vaccines among children with HIV infection receiving pediatric care in New York City and New Jersey. Outpatient records of 319 children being cared for by 16 participating physicians were reviewed. Of the 319 charts, 221 (69%) contained vaccination histories. Perinatal transmission of HIV infection was suspected for 208 (94%) of the 221 cases and infection via transfusion for the remaining 13 (6%). Of the 221 for whom immunization histories were available, 180 (81%) had received at least one dose of live oral polio vaccine and 70 (32%) had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. There were 120 children for whom a temporal relationship between immunization and onset of symptoms of immunodeficiency could be seen; 46/120 had received at least one dose of oral polio vaccine and 23/45 had received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine after onset of symptoms. Although follow-up of this population has been limited, there were no reports of serious adverse events such as typical or atypical measles, paralytic poliomyelitis, or aseptic meningitis in the month following vaccination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5413,0.006,6.0,The increasing impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the health care delivery system requires surveillance of current patterns of HIV-related health care utilization to adequately plan for future needs.

1408,0.006,6.0,"RNA virus population dynamics are complex, and sophisticated approaches are needed in many cases for therapeutic intervention. One such approach, termed lethal mutagenesis, is directed at targeting the virus population structure for extinction or error catastrophe. Previous studies have demonstrated the concept of this approach with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by use of chemical mutagens [i.e., 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)] as well as by host factors with mutagenic properties (i.e., APOBEC3G). In this study, these two unrelated mutagenic agents were used concomitantly to investigate the interplay of these distinct mutagenic mechanisms. Specifically, an HIV-1 was produced from APOBEC3G (A3G)-expressing cells and used to infect permissive target cells treated with 5-AZC. Reduced viral infectivity and increased viral mutagenesis were observed with both the viral mutagen (i.e., G-to-C mutations) and the host restriction factor (i.e., G-to-A mutations); however, when combined, they had complex interactions. Intriguingly, nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that concomitant HIV-1 exposure to both 5-AZC and A3G resulted in an increase in G-to-A viral mutagenesis at the expense of G-to-C mutagenesis. A3G catalytic activity was required for the diminution in G-to-C mutagenesis. Taken together, our findings provide the first demonstration for potentiation of the mutagenic effect of a cytosine analog by A3G expression, resulting in concomitant HIV-1 lethal mutagenesis."
2549,0.006,6.0,"The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection and risk factors associated to it. Three hundred sixty-one HBsAg chronic carriers from southern Italy were studied and 13.8% of them resulted anti-delta positive. 80% of these subjects were less than 50 years old. When anti-delta positive subjects were compared with anti-delta negative ones, a lower number of healthy HDV carriers and a higher frequency of cirrhotics were noted among anti-delta positive. Of lower than 50 years, imprisonment, sexual contacts with drug abusers and male homosexuality were risk factors of HDV infection. No association was found with sex, household contacts with HBV or HDV carriers, number of family members and transfusion of blood products. These data confirm the high prevalence of HDV infection in southern Italy."
1020,0.006,6.0,"In addition to development or selection of resistance, failure to continuously suppress HIV-1 production while still using initially effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may result from super-infection with a drug-resistant strain. Both transmission of drug resistant HIV and super-infection have been demonstrated. We analysed HIV pol genes obtained before start of initially successful cART and during failure while still on cART in 101 patients. Difference in precART and cART failure sequences were explained by evolution and not by super-infection."
9396,0.006,6.0,"Recent studies have shown that a single-nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the interleukin-28B (IL28B) gene plays a major role in predicting therapeutic response in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)/ribavirin. We sought to investigate the mechanism of the IL28B polymorphism, specifically as it relates to early HCV viral kinetics, IFN pharmacokinetics, IFN pharmacodynamics, and gene expression profiles. Two prospective cohorts (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]/HCV-coinfected and HCV-monoinfected) completing treatment with IFN/ribavirin were enrolled. Patients were genotyped at the polymorphic site rs12979860. In the HIV/HCV cohort, frequent serum sampling was completed for HCV RNA and IFN levels. DNA microarray of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and individual expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were quantified on IFN therapy. The IL28B-favorable (CC) genotype was associated with improved therapeutic response compared with unfavorable (CT or TT) genotypes. Patients with a favorable genotype had greater first- and second-phase viral kinetics (P = 0.004 and P = 0.036, respectively), IFN maximum antiviral efficiency (P = 0.007) and infected cell death loss (P = 0.009) compared with unfavorable genotypes. Functional annotation analysis of DNA microarray data was consistent with depressed innate immune function, particularly of natural killer cells, from patients with unfavorable genotypes (P <0.004). Induction of innate immunity genes was also lower in unfavorable genotypes. ISG expression at baseline and induction with IFN was independent of IL28B genotype."
6042,0.006,6.0,"Increased concentrations of neopterin, a marker for cell-mediated immune activation, and decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells, are predictors for progression of disease after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Previous studies have demonstrated different rates of onset of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) for groups of patients, defined by laboratory marker values, who were initially symptom-free. By re-analysis of one such study, we demonstrate how for an individual patient, the individual marker values, together with a prior risk estimate, can be converted into current or accumulated post-test probability of onset of AIDS at a certain time. We used a statistical technique suggested by Albert et al. (Clin Chem 1984;30:69-76), which allows incorporation of fixed and time-dependent covariates. Besides allowing individual projections, the method shows that the predictive abilities of CD4+ T cell numbers and of neopterin concentrations do not vary greatly with regard to time of observation; both laboratory markers independently modulate the underlying prior probability of AIDS onset, which is significantly increased with the passage of time."
6181,0.006,6.0,"Maraviroc (Pfizer's UK-427857, Selzentry or Celsentri outside the USA) is the first agent in the new class of oral HIV-1 entry inhibitors to acquire approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Considering the mechanism of action, it is expected that this drug will be effective only in a subpopulation of HIV-1-infected people, namely those harbouring the R5 virus. The favourable toxicity profile of the drug has been demonstrated in Phase III clinical trials in treatment-naive (MERIT) and treatment-experienced (MOTIVATE) patients. In the latter population, maraviroc showed a superior antiviral efficacy and immunological activity compared with optimized backbone therapy + placebo. However, in MERIT, a prospective double-blind, randomized trial in treatment-naive patients, maraviroc + zidovudine/lamivudine failed to prove non-inferiority to efavirenz + zidovudine/lamivudine as standard of care regimen in the 48 week intention-to-treat analysis. Using an assay with higher sensitivity for minority CXCR4-using (X4) HIV variants (the enhanced Trofile assay-Monogram), non-inferiority was reached for the maraviroc- versus efavirenz-based combination. These data indicate the important impact of the sensitivity of tropism testing on treatment outcome of maraviroc-containing regimens. This paper discusses both the prospective and retrospective analyses of the MERIT data and highlights the impact of these results on daily practice in HIV care."
3793,0.006,6.0,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are among the major public health challenges in Cameroon. This paper determined the effect of men's sex-related behaviors and HIV knowledge on reported STIs. The data came from the 2012 Cameroon's Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) that were collected from 7191 respondents in 2012. Descriptive and logistic regression methods were used for data analysis. Results showed that majority of the respondents were aware of STIs and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), while 3.96% reported STIs. Also, 49.45% of the men had no wife, while 75.58% and 84.58% noted that condoms and keeping of one partner could be used to prevent HIV transmission, respectively. Wrong impressions that mosquito bites and sharing of food could lead to HIV infection were held by 31.94% and 12.44% of the men, respectively. Among those that reported STIs, 33.33%, 30.18% and 13.33% respectively used condom during sex with most recent partner, second to most recent partner and third to most recent partner, compared to 24.69%, 15.04% and 4.17% among those that did not report STIs. Logistic regression results showed that probability of STI increased significantly (p < 0.05) with condom use with third most recent partners, being married, wrong knowledge that mosquito bites cause HIV and being away for more than one month, while it significantly reduced (p < 0.05) with number of children, knowledge that having one partner prevents STIs. It was concluded that policy initiatives and programmes to enhance right sexual knowledge and behavior among men would go a long way in reducing STI incidence in Cameroon."
9188,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates from Iranian patients around the country were characterized. Eighty-one complete genomes from HBV isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The studied population was grouped into three categories including inactive carriers, patients with chronic hepatitis, and patients with liver cirrhosis. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses revealed that Iranian patients were infected with HBV genotype D and subgenotype D1. The most common subtype was ayw2, followed by ayw3 and ayw4. Several deletions and insertions that had no correlation with disease outcome were observed in the HBV genomes. The most frequent mutation in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) was sP120S. Almost half of the patients studied carried precore (PC) mutant variants and one-third of the studied population was infected with variants carrying basal core promoter (BCP) mutations. PC and BCP mutations were observed in older patients, especially in those with chronic liver disease. Sixty-seven patients (82.7%) were HBeAg negative, and the prevalence of precore mutant isolates (G1896A) was higher in this group than in HBeAg-positive patients. Lamivudine drug resistance mutations were detected after 1 year of treatment in about 30% of lamivudine-treated patients. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HBV subgenotype D1 is the only subgenotype circulating in Iran, and there is no evidence of any exotic genotype in the region. The HBV PC (G1896A) mutation may play an important role in the clinical outcome of the disease by increasing the risk of progressive liver disease among Iranian patients infected with HBV."
9487,0.006,6.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most prominent health care challenges world wide. In Western industrialized countries where common access to antiretroviral drugs exists, HIV infection is a well treatable disease in the long-term for most patients. However, given the possible evolution of drug-resistance, the right combination of antiretroviral drugs in first-line therapy is crucial for maintaining long-term success. For each individual patient, the ideal time to start antiretroviral therapy must be carefully selected. The individual risk of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the one hand, and the risks of long-term toxicity and adherence problems under therapy on the other hand must be taken into account. Each patient should be counseled according to present treatment guidelines on when and how to start HAART, taking into account the surrogate markers CD4-cell count and HIV-RNA as well as clinically apparent HIV-associated disease."
5434,0.006,6.0,"Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was used to characterize the precore region of HBV from Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis. Two types of mutually exclusive variants were found in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative patients. The first (M1) contains a substitution from proline to serine at codon 15. A second group were infected with a previously described mutant (M2) containing a translational stop codon. HBeAg-positive patients were infected with the wild-type virus or the M1-containing strain. M2 emerged in patients with wild-type infection after seroconversion to anti-HBe, whereas M1 was present during the HBeAg-positive phase. In those with fluctuating HBe status, there was no correlation between prevailing HBe serology and sequence. There was an association between infection with variants and severe chronic hepatitis. Patients infected with strains containing M1 while HBeAg positive had a worse prognosis after seroconversion to anti-HBe."

4623,0.006,6.0,"Wasting remains a significant condition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection despite antiretroviral treatment. Early identification requires the measurement of various body composition parameters, particularly body cell mass (BCM). Anthropometry may provide some useful information. Cost and complexity issues make many body composition techniques unsuitable for the clinical setting. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be the best method available to caregivers for monitoring serial changes in BCM over time and for determining the occurrence of wasting. It is not useful, however, for detecting body composition changes in patients with fat redistribution syndromes. Portability, low cost, ease of use, and patient acceptance make anthropometry and BIA ideally suited for the clinical setting."
5566,0.006,6.0,"Early studies of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use in clinical practice suggested suboptimal rates of viral suppression. HAART regimens and expertise in the use of HAART have since evolved, and we sought to determine how virologic response to HAART has changed in clinical practice. We compared all patients who started a first HAART regimen from 1996 through 2002 in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected patients in care in Baltimore. There were significant improvements in suppressing HIV RNA to < 400 copies/mL, ranging from 43.8% (1996) to 72.4% (2001-2002) by 6 months and from 60.1% (1996) to 79.9% (2001-2002) by 12 months (both P < 0.01 for trend). There were also significant improvements in CD4 cell response. Over time, there was a significant increase in the use of a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or boosted protease inhibitor (PI) regimen compared with a single PI as well as an increase in the number of patients who were antiretroviral (ARV) naive. There was also a significant temporal trend from 1996 through 2002 in achieving a suppressed HIV RNA level, adjusting for being ARV naive, specific HAART regimen, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 RNA level, and demographic factors. This suggests that improved virologic response may also be attributable to other factors such as a greater focus on medication adherence, improved ARV tolerability, and ease of dosing."
5890,0.006,6.0,"We evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of neopterin, a putative marker of activated macrophages, in 97 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 who had a spectrum of neurological complications. The highest CSF neopterin concentrations occurred in those with neurological opportunistic infections, primary central nervous systems lymphoma, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex. In general, the CSF concentration of neopterin was independent of CSF cell count and blood-brain barrier disruption to albumin. In the patients with AIDS dementia complex, CSF neopterin concentrations correlated with severity of disease and decreased in conjunction with clinical improvement following treatment with zidovudine. These results suggest that CSF neopterin, although not disease-specific, may be useful as a surrogate marker for the presence of AIDS dementia complex and its response to antiviral therapy."
7023,0.006,6.0,"At least one-third of the 34 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide are infected with latent tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HIV infection in TB patients and its determinants in Wuxi City, China. TB patients attending health institutions (12 selected sites) for TB diagnosis and treatment were enrolled in this study. TB diagnosis, treatment and HIV testing were done according to the national guidelines. Blood samples were collected for anonymous HIV testing. Among the TB patients, the HIV prevalence was 13.66% (1493/10,926). Multivariate analysis showed that gender, age, education, marital status, per capita monthly income, patient residence, family size, distance from a health institution, knowledge of HIV-TB co-infection, and knowledge of HIV may be risk factors for HIV-TB co-infection (all: odds ratio > 1, p < 0.05). The prevalence of TB in those with HIV was higher among the study participants. Improving public awareness of HIV-TB co-infection, regularly screening and improving follow-up can reduce the occurrence of HIV-TB co-infection."
1433,0.006,6.0,"Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is a possible treatment for acute or chronic liver failure due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but reinfection of the graft can be a serious complication. The aim of this study was to monitor HBV markers, to analyse pre-core-/core-mutations as well as to identify the viral population causing reinfection after OLT, and to investigate the emergence or disappearance of these mutants in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Fifty-four pre-and posttransplant serum samples of 17 patients were analysed. All patients underwent OLT for HBV-related liver disease and had HBV-DNA before and after OLT. Total DNA was extracted from all sera and a 240 bp fragment comprising the pre-core region of HBV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pre-core mutants of HBV were determined by direct sequencing of these PCR products and by sequencing of PCR clones. Eight of 17 patients were infected with pre-core wildtype HBV before OLT (group A). Seven of eight patients of group A were reinfected by pre-core wildtype HBV after OLT. In one of eight patients in addition to wildtype HBV a mutant strain (nt. 1899 G-->A) was detected. Nine of 17 patients were infected with pre-core mutant HBV before OLT (group B). Six of nine patients of group B were reinfected with the same mutant population; in one, an additional pre-core mutation emerged; two patients lost pre-core mutant HBV (nt. 1896 and 1899 G-->A). In one of the latter two, a pre-core start-codon mutant (nt. 1816 G-->T), not detectable before OLT, emerged, in the other a nt. 1897 G-->A stop-codon mutant persisted. Five patients of each group were followed-up for more than 24 (25 to 58) months on immunosuppressive therapy. In all five patients of group A, pre-core wildtype of HBV persisted during long-term follow up. Two of five patients of group B were infected stably with a stop-codon HBV-mutant nt. 1896. In three patients, the nt. 1896 stop-codon mutant disappeared during immunosuppressive therapy. However, in one of the latter three, an HBV stop-codon mutant nt. 1897 persisted. In conclusion, most patients who underwent OLT for HBV-related disease were reinfected with the same virus population that existed before OLT. In rare cases, new mutants emerged after OLT or preexisting mutants were lost. During long-term follow-up on immunosuppressive therapy, in the majority of patients pre-core mutants disappeared and wildtype HBV became the predominant virus strain."
2450,0.006,6.0,"The risk for dental hygienists to contract HIV and hepatitis B infection at work was studied in an international cohort of 167 dental hygienists from 13 countries. A significant proportion of the hygienists had taken care of HIV-positive patients or patients known to be at risk for contracting HIV infection. None of the hygienists had antibodies to HIV. Five hygienists who came from or worked in high-endemic areas for hepatitis B infection had antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, consistent with previous infection with hepatitis B virus. The study is in agreement with previous reports on blood-borne infections among health care workers, concluding that the risk for dental hygienists of contracting HIV and hepatitis B infection is minimal."
398,0.006,6.0,"Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their relationship with health-care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV care in the southeastern US (n=526). We used multivariate logistic regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%) reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%) of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication adherence (p=0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits (including Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006) and a support group (p=0.040) were associated with being less likely to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health-related counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p=0.003). Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance of interventions to address these needs."
3943,0.006,6.0,"There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus, further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) are tackled."
9306,0.006,6.0,"The treatment costs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients continue to rise as patients survive longer because of advances in antiretroviral therapy and effective chemoprophylaxis. Medication costs per patient increase in proportion to progressive immunodeficiency. We retrospectively studied medication costs for 196 HIV-infected patients with stratification by CD4-lymphocyte count. Medication costs per patient-month were correlated with CD4-lymphocyte count (linear regression, r = -.53, P < 0.01), with higher costs associated with lower CD4 counts. The medication cost for patients with CD4 counts < 100 cells/mm3 averaged $1043 per month. Medication costs per patient increase with the development of each new opportunistic infection or other AIDS-associated condition. Costs can be expected to increase as new therapeutic agents are introduced, as treatment is initiated at earlier stages of HIV infection, and as more patients survive to the point of severe CD4-lymphocyte depletion."

7308,0.006,6.0,"Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used in a rural hospital of Cameroon to assess how much nursing personnel know about and practise in regard to human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and to determine health service factors that influence knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP). Participants included 107 nursing and laboratory staff and 62 patients with AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were used for nurses, and close-ended questionnaires were administered to patients with AIDS (as a verification tool for staff responses). Focus group discussions (FGD) held with nurse supervisors evaluated health service factors that influence KAP. Overall, 70.1% of the nurses who responded scored highly in the knowledge section compared to 50.5% in the attitude and practice section. There were several outstanding misconceptions and malpractices about HIV/AIDS. Knowledge, but not attitude, was significantly influenced by the grade of the staff (P< 0.001 and P = 0.17, respectively). Approximately 15% of 62 patients with AIDS indicated that they were attended to with signs of disgust and/or hatred. The major health service factors thought to influence KAP, confirmed by many in all the FGD, included: the lack of adequate information; the lack of commitment to alter attitudes and practices; the lack of in-service promotions; and the ongoing fear of becoming infected with the virus through caring for patients with AIDS. Low income also seemed to have an influence on KAP. Therefore, it is imperative that ongoing education programmes are provided for nurses to enable them to meet the needs of the increasing HIV prevalence in our community. Information, education and communication, and compliance with international working norms, remain essential tools in the control of HIV/AIDS spread in our hospital settings."

Pre-exposure hepatitis B vaccination and the use of standard precautions to prevent exposure to blood are the most effective strategies for preventing DHCP from occupational infection with HIV, HBV or HCV. Each dental health care facility should develop a comprehensive written program for preventing and managing occupational exposures to blood that: (1) describes the types of blood exposures that may place DHCP at risk for infection; (2) outlines procedures for promptly reporting and evaluating such exposures; and (3) identifies a health care professional who is qualified to provide counseling and perform all medical evaluations and procedures in accordance with the most current USPHS recommendations. Finally, resources should be available that permit rapid access to clinical care, testing, counseling, and PEP for exposed DHCP and the testing and counseling of source patients."

The study objective was to evaluate the quality of laboratory performance in testing for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody. After identifying relevant variables in univariate analyses, multivariate analyses were performed using stepwise logistic models. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 antibody test performance was independently associated with analytic variables such as commercial test kit used and with nonanalytic variables such as experience, training, and degree requirements of laboratory personnel. These results validate the importance of nonanalytic variables to the quality of outcomes in laboratory testing."
4611,0.006,6.0,"In the United States, transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from health care exposures has been considered uncommon. However, a review of outbreak information revealed 33 outbreaks in nonhospital health care settings in the past decade: 12 in outpatient clinics, 6 in hemodialysis centers, and 15 in long-term care facilities, resulting in 448 persons acquiring HBV or HCV infection. In each setting, the putative mechanism of infection was patient-to-patient transmission through failure of health care personnel to adhere to fundamental principles of infection control and aseptic technique (for example, reuse of syringes or lancing devices). Difficult to detect and investigate, these recognized outbreaks indicate a wider and growing problem as health care is increasingly provided in outpatient settings in which infection control training and oversight may be inadequate. A comprehensive approach involving better viral hepatitis surveillance and case investigation, health care provider education and training, professional oversight, licensing, and public awareness is needed to ensure that patients are always afforded basic levels of protection against viral hepatitis transmission."
1679,0.006,6.0,"The epidemic of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) poses a major ethical question: How can we control the epidemic and the harm that it causes without unjustly discriminating against particular social groups and without unnecessarily infringing on the freedom of individuals? This question pertains to three spheres of public policy in the United States: public health, the delivery of health care, and research. In the public health sphere, vigorous educational efforts will be required, as will modified approaches to intravenous drug use, prostitution, and homosexual and bisexual sexual activity. Carefully targeted, voluntary testing and screening programs should be coupled with counseling and with guarantees of confidentiality and nondiscrimination where these are appropriate. Both health care workers and the health care system have a moral obligation to provide care to people with HIV infection, but heroic self-sacrifice should not be required provided that infection control precautions are observed. Patients with neurological involvement and terminally ill patients will benefit from statutes allowing recognition of advance directives about preferred modes of care or nontreatment. There is a moral imperative to perform intensive research directed toward the understanding, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and AIDS. The research process will raise challenging ethical questions."
6467,0.006,6.0,"A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate HIV seroprevalence among infectious (smear positive) cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and to describe the relation between antituberculosis drug resistance and infection with human immunodeficiency virus. A total of 418 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who attended the out patient departments of Harar Tuberculosis Centre and two general hospitals were studied from October 1994 through January 1995. The majority (94%) of these patients were from the tuberculosis centre. Sputum cultures were positive for 338/418 (80.9%) patients. HIV seroprevalence was 92/418 (22.0%) among smear positive and 69/338 (20.4%) among culture positive patients. HIV positive patients were more likely to be from urban than rural areas (p < 0.001). Initial resistance was not affected by HIV seropositivity. Secondary drug resistance was significantly higher in HIV positive patients than HIV negatives (p < 0.05). Although not significant, HIV positive patients were more defaulters than HIV negatives. Significantly higher numbers of HIV positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were cases of relapse and treatment failure (p < 0.05). Other studies are required in order to assess the impact of HIV infection on the spread of anti-tuberculosis resistance. Supervised and appropriate treatments with follow up are required in order to minimise the spread of drug resistant tubercle bacilli among HIV infected patients."

Three out of 63 studied samples (4.8%) were positive in a qualitative test for total antibodies to HDV antigen. Five samples (7.9%) turned out to be HDV-RNA-positive by RT-PCR, four of them were sequenced in the region of L-HDAg, and phylogenetic analysis was performed. All four examined samples belonged to genotype I. Two RNA-positive/anti-HD-negative samples possessed a few uncommon nucleotide substitution sites within the L-HDAg sequence, which could suggest unique variants in the Polish population of HDV-infected patients."

Similar to previous reports of hyperthyroidism due to IRD, all of our patients experienced a rapid early recovery in total CD4 count, but developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism on average 3 years (38 months) after beginning cART, which represents a longer time frame than previously reported. Awareness and recognition of this potential complication of cART, which may occur years after treatment initiation, will allow patients with immune restorative hyperthyroidism to receive timely therapy and avoid the long-term complications associated with undiagnosed thyroid disease."
2286,0.006,6.0,"The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, is an important immunoregulatory hormone [1]. Its effects are exerted by interaction with the vitamin D receptor, which is present on human monocytes and activated T and B lymphocytes. Variation in the vitamin D receptor gene was typed in 2015 subjects from large case-control studies of three major infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, and hepatitis B virus. Homozygotes for a polymorphism at codon 352 (genotype tt) were significantly underrepresented among those with tuberculosis (chi2=6.22, 1 df, P=. 01) and persistent hepatitis B infection (chi2=6.25, 1 df, P=.01) but not in subjects with clinical malaria compared with the other genotypes. Therefore, this genetic variant, which predisposes to low bone mineral density in many populations, may confer resistance to certain infectious diseases."

Between 2005 and 2009, we enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspected histoplasmosis at a hospital-based HIV clinic in Guatemala City. A case of suspected histoplasmosis was defined as a person presenting with at least three of five clinical or radiologic criteria.

4892,0.006,6.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an occupational risk of surgeons especially in developing countries where asymptomatic carrier rate is about 15%. Despite better knowledge about mode of transmission and methods of prevention including use of active immunization, it still remains a threat. In this study, a questionnaire survey of Nigerian surgeons was conducted to ascertain their knowledge, and immunization status against HBV infection. Our study showed a 9.3% incidence of clinical HBV infection, poor perception of risk of infection, poor local availability of vaccines, and low uptake where same was available. Reasons cited for non-immunization are lack of awareness, cost, inertia and non-availability of vaccines. Only 10.2% of our respondents always used barrier methods, and 77.7% of our respondents do not check the immune status of their patients after sustaining an intraoperative sharp injury. The overall level of knowledge about HBV infection was deemed poor. We conclude with recommendations on how to improve knowledge about HBV infection and uptake of vaccines."
8678,0.006,6.0,"The severe complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome represent the final phase of a prolonged course of immune system destruction during the infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many of these complications can be predicted by measuring the depletion of CD4 positive lymphocytes. The CD4 positive lymphocyte counts are now widely accepted as a surrogate marker to assess the stage of disease and to determine immune response in major clinical trials. Other lymphocyte subsets are candidate surrogate markers for antiretroviral therapy. Our laboratory has utilized flow cytometry to perform lymphocyte subset testing, including CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 ratio, and others for more than three years on persons with suspected immune deficiency. Results from our laboratory are presented to illustrate the use of these procedures in an urban, predominantly inner city population. The role of flow cytometry in monitoring patients with HIV infection is discussed."
6815,0.006,6.0,"This study aims to determine the relationship among cerebral metabolite concentrations (on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy or (1)H MRS), cognitive function, and clinical variables (CD4, plasma and CSF viral loads, and lipids) in antiretroviral medication-nai;ve HIV patients. We hypothesized that the probable glial markers myo-inositol [MI] and choline compounds [CHO] would correlate with cognitive function, CD4 count, and viral loads, but not with serum lipids. Forty-five antiretroviral-drug-nai;ve HIV patients and 25 control subjects were evaluated. Frontal lobe [MI], [CHO], and total creatine [CR] were elevated, while basal ganglia [CR] were decreased, with increasing dementia severity. As a group, HIV patients showed slowing on fine motor (Grooved Pegboard) and psychomotor function (Trails A & B), and deficits on executive function (Stroop tasks). Lower CD4 counts and elevated plasma viral loads were associated with elevated frontal white matter [MI], which in turn correlated with the Stroop tasks. These findings suggest that systemic factors (resulting from suppressed immune function and higher plasma viral load) may lead to glial proliferation (elevated [MI], [CHO], and [CR]) in the frontal white matter, which in turn may contribute to deficits on executive function in HIV. Studying antiretroviral-nai;ve patients minimized the confounding effects of antiretroviral treatment on the clinical, MRS, and neuropsychological variables, and allowed for a more accurate assessment of the relationships among these measurements. Metabolite concentrations, rather than metabolite ratios, should be measured since [CR], a commonly used reference for metabolite ratios, varies with disease severity in both frontal lobe and basal ganglia."

The frequency of drug resistance mutations (DRM) and the genetic variability of HIV-1 isolates from newly diagnosed HIV-infected pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics of the Lucrecia Paim and Augusto N'Gangula maternities, Luanda-Angola, were determined. Thirty five out of 57 samples (61.4%) were sequenced and one mutation associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was detected. Additionally, two mutations associated with resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors were also detected. No primary mutations associated with protease inhibitors (PI) were found. Subtypes A1, C, D, F1, G, H, CRF 13, CRF 37, and other mosaics were detected."

Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2:1.Compared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection.Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care."
9567,0.005,5.0,"2346 liver samples from 17 areas in China were investigated for intrahepatic hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) by direct enzyme-labelled technique. HDAg was detected in 167 out of 1764 samples of HBsAg positive individuals with the detection rate of 9.47%. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection existed in all the examined areas without any significant difference regarding HDAg detection rate. A relationship of intrahepatic HDAg to the pathologic type of the liver disease was observed. The HDAg detection rate in chronic liver diseases and severe hepatitis was higher than in other liver diseases. It suggested that HDV infection was associated with the progression and chronicity of the liver disease. Studies on the relationship between HDV infection and HBV replication showed that HBV replication might be suppressed by HDV infection. Both HDV and HBV, however, could replicate in the same hepatocyte simultaneously."
5760,0.005,5.0,"Several of the common viral agents that can cause hepatitis have been detected in body fluids, including saliva and blood, which may both form important routes for transmission of disease. The viruses most commonly implicated include hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be found in persons positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and presumably follows the same routes of transmission as HBV. Herpes simplex and echo viruses can cause hepatitis on rare occasion. Other agents, not yet positively identified but collectively referred to as non-A, non-B are also believed to follow the same routes as HBV and/or HAV. The aim of this reviews is twofold. First, we will discuss hepatotropic viruses other than HBV that may be spread via saliva and blood and, therefore, should be considered along with HBV as a potential health hazard to dental personnel and also to dental patients. The second aim is to highlight the epidemiology and the risk of transmission of these viral infections. The potential hazards are discussed in relation to those associated with HBV and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), implicated in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
2722,0.005,5.0,": To date, the relation between the CD8 antiviral factor (CAF) and clinical indicators of disease progression in HIV-1 infection (CD4 T-cell counts and viral load [VL]) is inconclusive. Particularly, the effect of antiretroviral therapy and immune recovery on CAF production remains unclear. Using a transient transfection assay and a reporter gene activated by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), we analyzed CAF production in CD8 T cells of HIV-1-positive individuals divided into 3 groups: patients on protease inhibitor (PI)-based therapy, patients on nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based therapy, and patients receiving no therapy. We found that within the untreated group, CAF activity inversely correlated with VL and high CAF was associated with lower VLs over a period of 0.5 to 3 years. Furthermore, patients who were drug-naive demonstrated significantly higher CAF than untreated patients who had previously undergone antiretroviral therapy. CAF activity in treated patients was similar to CAF in drug-naive patients and higher than in off-treatment patients. There seemed to be a trend toward higher CAF in patients on NNRTI-based therapy compared with those on PI-based therapy. These results suggest that immune recovery after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) contributes to the normalization of CAF levels in HIV-1-positive individuals. Furthermore, we have distinguished between CD8 T-cell-mediated suppression of HIV-1 replication and gene transcription."
636,0.005,5.0,"Despite advances in antiretroviral therapy and in the treatment and prevention of opportunistic infections, oncological and consequent hematologic complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continue to occur and are of significant clinical importance. Virus-related tumors (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma, induced by human herpesvirus 8; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to Epstein-Barr virus; and anogenital tumors, linked to human papillomavirus) are frequent in patients with HIV-induced immune deficiency. The incidence of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma has declined among homosexual men, but this tumor remains problematic in many patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is 60 times more prevalent in HIV-positive persons than in others and typically presents as advanced-stage, high- or intermediate-grade B cell lymphoma, with frequent extranodal involvement. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is also common. Cervical carcinoma in HIV-positive women is also usually advanced at diagnosis. Anal carcinoma is increasing in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations. Chemotherapy for these tumors can result in dose-limiting cytopenia that can be well-controlled with hematopoietic growth factors, allowing patients to avoid transfusions and maintain the dose intensity of their chemotherapy regimens."
5894,0.005,5.0,"Approximately 1 million people are infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Malawi. Despite efforts aimed at changing individual risk behaviors, HIV prevalence continues to rise among rural populations. Both previous research and the Political Economy of Health framework suggest that community-based socio-economic factors and accessibility may influence HIV transmission; however, these community factors have received little empirical investigation. To fill this gap, this research uses data from a nationally representative probability sample of rural Malawians combined with small area estimates of community socio-economic and accessibility data in logistic regression models to: 1) reveal relationships between community factors and individual HIV status; 2) determine whether these relationships operate through individual HIV risk behaviors; and 3) explore whether these associations vary by gender. Community socio-economic factors include relative and absolute poverty; community accessibility factors include distance to roads, cities, and public health facilities. Individual HIV risk behaviors include reported condom use, sexually transmitted infections, multiple partnerships, and paid sex. Results show that higher community income inequality, community proximity to a major road, and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV for women. For men, community proximity to a major road and community proximity to a public health clinic are associated with increased odds of HIV infection. These direct relationships between community factors and individual HIV status are not mediated by individual HIV risk behaviors. The Political Economy of Health frames the discussion. This study provides evidence for expanding HIV prevention efforts beyond individual risk behaviors to consideration of community factors that may drive the HIV epidemic in rural Malawi."

A convenience sample of 287 clients (220 men and 67 women) was given a self-administered anonymous questionnaire. Overall, complementary therapy use was 31%. Patients who used complementary therapy were more likely to be white (O.R., 2.5), female (O.R. 3.3), a high school graduate (O.R. 2.9), and to know another complementary therapy user (O.R. 7.8). Age, sexual orientation, CD4 cell count, injection drug use, living with another HIV-infected person, having pain, and HIV support group membership were not associated. Men were more likely than women, and whites were more likely than nonwhites, to use vitamins/minerals, imagery/meditation, and dietary regimens. Nonwhites were more likely than whites, and women more likely than men, to use spiritual healing. Of those using complementary therapy, men were more likely than women, and whites more likely than nonwhites, to get information about complementary therapy from HIV organizations, friends, and homosexual-oriented media. Doctors and nurses were the most frequently cited source of complementary therapy information for women. Frequency, type of therapies used, and source of information about complementary therapy among HIV-infected persons vary by race and gender. Clinicians should be educated about complementary therapies so that they can provide information to their patients and be aware of self-treatment behavior."
3966,0.005,5.0,"Assiduous measures are taken to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infants; it is unclear whether the mothers receive appropriate care for their chronic HBV. We sought to assess the quality of HBV care in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers following pregnancy. HBsAg-positive women (n = 243) who had sought prenatal care at Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively identified and charts reviewed. The primary outcome was adherence to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Over one-third (37%) of women were first diagnosed with HBV infection at a prenatal visit. One-third (32%) did not undergo timely liver function test measurements. HBV DNA was never measured in 26% and was untimely in 34% of patients. One-third (34%) of the women were at high-risk for HCC based on AASLD criteria, yet only 33% of these women underwent timely imaging. Nearly half (49%) never saw a liver specialist for their HBV care. In multivariate analysis, women were 3.7 times more likely to have a timely ALT and 8.1 times more likely to have a timely HBV DNA if they were followed by a liver specialist (P = 0.001, <0.001). We demonstrate remarkably inadequate and discontinuous HBV care for chronically infected mothers following pregnancy. As HBV infection is already being identified prenatally, quality improvement measures encompassing obstetricians, primary care providers and hepatologists are needed to ensure that HBV-infected women are linked to care postpregnancy."
7973,0.005,5.0,"Drug resistance is an increasing problem in the treatment of HIV infection. Tenofovir has been shown to inhibit HIV replication even with thymidine-associated resistance mutations (TAMs) if they are limited to two or less. Double-dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (600 mg QD) was used to determine weather the drug could be virologically effective in patients harbouring HIV-strains resistant to nucleoside analogues (NRTI). A pilot, open, non-comparative add-on study, where patients failing a current antiretroviral regimen, with at least two TAMs, and naive for tenofovir, were given tenofovir 600 mg once-daily for 4 weeks, in addition to their current failing antiretroviral regimen. The primary end-point was the percentage of patients with plasma viral load (VL) reduction of at least 0.8 log(10) between baseline and week 4 (W4). Ten patients were enrolled. At baseline, the median viral load was 3.66 log(10) copies/ml (range 3.13-4.03) and the median CD4 cell count was 407/mm(3) (range 136-1102). The percentage of patients with reduction the viral load > or =0.8 log(10) was 40% at W4. After 4 weeks of treatment with tenofovir 600 mg, the median decrease in the viral load was -0.61 log(10) (range -0.05; -0.88) and the median gain of CD4 was +109/mm(3). Despite a twofold increase tenofovir plasma concentrations, no serious drug-related adverse event were recorded except for one patient experiencing an de Fanconi syndrome at week 2. This add-on pilot study supports the concept of double dose tenofovir to virologically overcome the decreased sensitivity of NRTI-resistant viruses. However, the safety of this regimen needs to be considered carefully."

The association of insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis was also investigated."
5323,0.005,5.0,"In epidemiologic studies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are at higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus compared with women with similar treatment histories. We used metabolomics to determine whether a sex difference in plasma amino acids, acylcarnitines, and organic acids predictive of diabetes and impaired energy metabolism is present in HIV-infected persons on long-term ART.We enrolled 70 HIV-infected adults (43% women) on efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (Atripla) with HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for over 2 years. Half of the HIV-infected subjects were obese, and these were matched with 30 obese HIV-negative controls. All subjects had no history of diabetes, statin use, or heavy alcohol use. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured using homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2), and adipose tissue was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to quantitate fasting plasma branched chain and aromatic amino acids predictive of incident diabetes, and C3 and C5 acylcarnitinines and organic acids indicative of impaired energy metabolism.HIV-infected women had more baseline risk factors for insulin resistance: women were older (46 vs 44 years) and had a longer ART duration (8.4 vs 5.1 years, P < 0.05 for both) compared with men but had similar CD4+ count (median 701 cells/μL), smoking and hepatic C prevalence, and body mass index (BMI) (median 30.3 kg/m). However, women had higher insulin sensitivity compared with men (P < 0.01), and lower plasma levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (P < 0.01 for all), and lower C3 and C5 acylcarnitines (P < 0.01 for all), in multivariable regression models after adjusting for DEXA fat mass index, age, race, CD4+ count, smoking, and ART duration. In the obese HIV-infected subjects and HIV-negative controls, the relationship of sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status.HIV-infected women on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART had superior glucose tolerance and lower plasma metabolites associated with the development of diabetes compared with men with similar metabolic disease risk profiles. The relationship between sex and plasma metabolite levels did not significantly differ according to HIV-status among obese subjects, suggesting the observed sex-differences may not be specific to HIV infection.

1456,0.005,5.0,"In untreated, asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, elevated serum concentrations of soluble receptors for tumor necrosis factor (sTNFR) types I and II are associated with progression to AIDS. To assess the utility of sTNFRs as markers for the assessment of antiretroviral treatment, sTNFRs were sequentially determined in 47 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected men, who participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Progression to AIDS or severe AIDS-related complex occurred in six zidovudine (ZDV)- and six placebo-treated subjects. During ZDV treatment (n = 28) both types of sTNFRs declined compared with baseline and placebo, whereas they increased during placebo treatment (n = 19). A sustained decline of sTNFRs occurred only in subjects who experienced no disease progression. During the first 3 months of ZDV treatment, the hazard ratio for disease progression when sTNFR type II rose above the baseline value plus 5% was significantly increased (hazard ratio: approximately 25; 95% confidence interval: approximately 1.5-400; p < 0.03). Simultaneously determined CD4+ counts and serum neopterin levels showed a similar pattern in progressors and nonprogressors. Thus, in contrast to CD4+ counts and neopterin levels, sTNFR concentrations, especially those of the type II STNFR, appear to be valuable surrogate markers for monitoring the efficacy of ZDV treatment in asymptomatic HIV-1 infection."
2022,0.005,5.0,"Intracellular delivery of novel macromolecular drugs against human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), including antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, ribozymes and therapeutic genes, may be achieved by encapsulation in or association with certain types of liposomes. Liposomes may also protect these drugs against nucleases. Low-molecular-weight, charged antiviral drugs may also be delivered more efficiently via liposomes. Liposomes were targeted to HIV-1-infected cells via covalently coupled soluble CD4. An HIV-1 protease inhibitor encapsulated in conventional negatively charged multilamellar liposomes was about 10-fold more effective and had a lower EC90 than the free drug in inhibiting HIV-1 production in human monocyte-derived macrophages. The drug encapsulated in sterically stabilized liposomes was as effective as the free drug. The EC50 of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) was reduced by an order of magnitude when delivered to HIV-1-infected macrophages in pH-sensitive liposomes. A 15-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against the Rev response element was ineffective in free form against HIV-1 replication in macrophages, while delivery of the oligonucleotide in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus replication. The oligodeoxynucleotide encapsulated in sterically stabilized pH-sensitive liposomes with prolonged circulation in vivo, which were recently developed in the laboratories of the authors, was also highly effective. A ribozyme complementary to HIV-1 5'-LTR delivered in pH-sensitive liposomes inhibited virus production by 90%, while the free ribozyme caused only a slight inhibition. Cationic liposome-mediated co-transfection of the HIV-regulated diphtheria toxin A fragment gene and a proviral HIV clone into HeLa cells completely inhibited virus production, while the frame-shifted mutant gene was ineffective. Co-transfection of the proviral genome and a gene encoding a Rev-binding aptamer into HeLa cells via transferrin-associated cationic liposomes inhibited virus production. These studies indicate that liposomes can be used to facilitate the intracellular delivery of certain anti-HIV agents and to enhance their therapeutic effects. These properties may be particularly advantageous in the development of novel macromolecular drugs, which may be necessary because of the emergence of virus strains resistant to the currently available drugs."
3726,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV-DNA) was studied by Southern blot analysis in liver biopsy specimens from 75 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic liver disease living in southern Italy. Twenty-seven of the patients were hepatitis delta virus (HDV) superinfected. Intrahepatic HBV-DNA was detected in 54 (72%) patients, 32 (59%) of them with replicative forms. The presence of replicative forms was directly related to liver HBcAg and inversely related to liver HDAg, as shown by multivariate analysis. However, 14 patients with intrahepatic HBV-DNA non-replicative pattern and about half of HDV-infected patients were liver HBcAg and/or serum HBV-DNA positive, mostly in low amounts. Histological inflammatory activity was strongly related to liver HBcAg expression regardless of HDV superinfection, as confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our results confirm previous studies about the concordance between intrahepatic HBV-DNA replicative pattern and liver HBcAg expression and about inhibition by HDV of high-level HBV replication. However, they suggest that low-level HBV replication may have an important role in causing liver damage also among HDV-infected patients, in a population where the spreading of HBV and HDV is a naturally occurring event."
6100,0.005,5.0,"It has been hypothesized that naturally occurring mutations in HBV may play a role in the pathogenesis of HBV-related disease. We determined the molecular characteristics of naturally occurring HBV isolates and performed a functional analysis of full-length hepatitis B virus quasispecies from a patient with chronic hepatitis B. The 10 HBV clones isolated were identified as HBV genotype B4 and subtype adw. In most clones, amino acid substitutions and nucleotide changes occurred in a specific region of the core protein, X protein and in the core promoter. In the core protein, cI3L, cL60M, and cI97L were detected in 8 of 10 clones and cP130T was detected in all 10 clones. In the X protein, xI127M was detected in 5 clones. In the basal core promoter, the A1762T/G1764A mutation was found only in 1 clone. An 11-bp nucleotide insertion between nucleotides 1772 and 1773, was found in 2 clones. Six clones that were replication-competent exhibited variation in the level of replicating capacity in vitro even though the average genetic distance between the HBV clones was only 0.5% (range: 0.3-0.7%). Among the replication-competent 6 clones, 5 clones showed higher replication competency compared with clone B9 (reference clone used in this study) in Huh7 cells. However, 4 clones showed lower replication competency compared with clone B9 in HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the HBV virus exhibits genetic variation in the form of quasispecies with different mutation patterns, and these quasispecies may be recognized by distinct viral replication patterns even in patients with subtle genetic mutation."

The objective is to describe the standard of care received by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH/A) at enrollment into one of five Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Sites located along the U.S.-Mexico border. This cross-sectional study describes the presence of opportunistic infections (OIs), AIDS status and two types of standard of care received by 707 PLWH/A participating in SPNS. Patients receiving care through SPNS in one of the five sites between June 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003 were invited to participate to the medical chart review component of the study. The association between sociodemographic variables and the prevalence of OIs and AIDS at enrollment was estimated using multivariate hierarchical logistic models. More than one quarter of the 707 participants had at least one OI recorded and 58% of new and 60% of existing patients had AIDS at enrollment in SPNS. The association between being Hispanic and having higher prevalence of OI and AIDS at entry varied by SPNS site. Standard of care was well followed overall. This is the first study describing HIV stage and OI prevalences and standard of care in PLWH/A in all U.S.-Mexico bordering states. Being of Hispanic ethnicity may not fully explain discrepancy in access to care along the border."

We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio, 0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission. Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health departments halted the outbreak."

The Antiretroviral Treatment and Access Studies included a mail survey of 176 HIV medical care facilities in four US inner cities on clinic characteristics, services and practices, and patient characteristics. Characteristics of 143 (85%) responding Ryan White (RW) funded and non-RW funded facilities are described. RW funded facilities reported offering more services than non-funded facilities including evening/weekend hours (49% vs. 18%), transportation (71% vs. 22%), and on-site risk reduction counselling (88% vs. 55%). More RW funded facilities reported offering on-site adherence support services, such as support groups (44% vs. 12%), formal classes (20% vs. 2%), and pillboxes (83% vs. 43%), and served a larger proportion of uninsured patients (41% vs. 4%) than non-funded facilities. Our analysis showed that the RW funded HIV care facilities offered more clinic, non-clinic, and adherence support services than non-RW funded facilities, indicating that the disparities in services were still related to CARE Act funding, controlling for private-public facility type."

To determine whether individuals to whom variants with isolated NNRTI-associated drug resistance were transmitted are at increased risk of virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen, we identified minority variant resistance mutations in 33 individuals with isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance and 49 matched controls. We found similar proportions of overall and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated minority variant resistance mutations in both groups, suggesting that isolated NNRTI-associated transmitted drug resistance may not be a risk factor for virological failure during treatment with a non-NNRTI-containing regimen."

All patients naïve to antiretrovirals who had > or =1 genotypic resistance testing at the Institute of Infectious Diseases (Brescia, Northern Italy) between 2001 and 2006 were analyzed. Primary resistance mutations were defined using epidemiological and clinical criteria. Mutations were interpreted using the Stanford University Algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess possible predictors of primary resistance mutations. Among 569 patients, 11% presented > or =1 mutation. Prevalence of primary resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI) was 6.3%, 6%, and 1.6%, respectively. The most frequent mutations to NRTI were substitutions at position 215 (215Y in 3 patients, and 215 revertants in 16), 41L (13), 219Q (12), and 210W (10). Among mutations to NNRTI, 103N was found in 21 patients, while 181C, 188L, and 190A/S in 8, 3, and 4 patients, respectively. Fifty-one patients (9%) had high-to-intermediate resistance to > or =1 antiretroviral drug before starting the treatment. Regarding the new generation drugs, nine patients had intermediate resistance to etravirine, five patients had intermediate resistance to tipranavir, while five, one, and seven patients had low resistance to etravirine, tipranavir, and darunavir. Homosexuals were more likely to harbor a virus with primary resistance mutations (OR:2.68; 95% CI:1.44-5.00; P = 0.002) while non-Italian nationality was protective (OR:0.38; 95% CI:0.17-0.86; P = 0.020). Prevalence of primary resistance mutations suggests that genotypic resistance testing should be performed before starting treatment in naïve patients in Italy, particularly when NNRTI are prescribed."
7159,0.005,5.0,The effect of universal hepatitis B vaccination on the prevalence of serologically negative hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and the emergence of HBsAg variants is unknown. We prospectively studied two different cohorts of 12--24 month old children in South Africa. They consisted of the unvaccinated children (n=459) born before the introduction of universal vaccination and the vaccinated children (n=1213) between 1 and 2 years after the introduction of the vaccination program. The frequency of detecting HBV DNA by PCR was reduced from 6.5% in unvaccinated children to 0.3% in vaccinated children (P<0.00001). There were no unique amino acid substitutions within the major hydrophilic region of the S sequence in both pre- and post-vaccination samples. Universal childhood vaccination reduced the frequency of serologically negative HBV infection and did not necessarily lead to selection of escape variants.

The specific aims of the current analysis were to determine (1) the prevalence of HCV infection in a large cohort of patients undergoing retransplantation, (2) define the impact of HCV infection on patient survival, and (3) determine the predictors of outcome of HCV-positive patients undergoing retransplantation for graft failure not caused by primary nonfunction."

Symptomatic raised cerebrospinal fluid pressure can be treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion (VPS). In HIV-infected patients however, there is a concern that VPS might be associated with unacceptably high rates of mortality. We aim to systematically review and appraise published literature to determine reported outcomes and identify predictors of outcome following VPS in relevant subgroups of HIV-infected adults."
8334,0.005,5.0,"Medication adherence is a complex behaviour with multiple determinants. Understanding the barriers and facilitators of adherence is invaluable for programme improvement, which assists the foundation of adherence intervention strategies. A qualitative study was conducted in six selected hospitals of Addis Ababa in 2008, to explore barriers and facilitators to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected paediatric patients. Twelve caregivers of adherent and non-adherent children and 14 key informants in five hospitals were included in the study. The findings revealed that over-dosage (heavy pill burden), fear of stigma and discrimination, cost and access to transportation, lack of understanding of the benefit of taking the medication, economic problems in the household, and lack of nutritional support were the barriers to adherence to HAART. The presence of mobile/wall alarm, the presence of follow-up counselling, improved health of the child, ART clinic setups, and disclosure of HIV serostatus were among the facilitators. This study indicated that paediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy faces a huge challenge. It suggests the provision of income-generating schemes to caregivers for assisting HIV-infected children. Health care providers should address proper usage of medication reminders."
7435,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share overlapping, large worldwide distribution. The implications of coinfection are being explored because of the importance of these viruses and demographic factors that favor coinfection. The nervous system is affected by HIV in a variety of ways resulting in significant disease of all levels of the nervous system. Emerging evidence that HCV can also impact the nervous system raises concerns that detrimental interactions might occur. Several reports addressing the manifestations of coinfection support independent contributions for both HIV and HCV on central nervous system performance, but not on distal sensory neuropathy. Neuropsychological testing reveals independent contributions resulting in poorer performance in coinfection in several drug-abusing cohorts. Motor physiologic testing substantiates performance deficits from HCV in coinfected subjects as does testing in treatment naive coinfected subjects. Although ongoing deficits attributed to HCV may be seen during HIV treatment, these deficits may be less apparent in advanced HIV disease. Current evidence supports independent contributions of HCV and HIV to neurological impairment. Preliminary evidence suggests that coinfection-related impairment does not appear to accelerate HIV-1-associated cognitive disease."
9870,0.005,5.0,"Human antibody response to Cryptosporidium parvum has been previously shown as involving immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG isotypes. The interest in anti-cryptosporidial IgA antibody response has been recently stimulated by studies on the therapeutic effects of secretory IgA antibodies to Cryptosporidium in animal models and in patients. In the present study, isotypes of serum anti-Cryptosporidium antibodies have been characterized in donors of the following categories: (a) healthy adults, (b) healthy children, (c) immunocompetent children with transient cryptosporidial diarrhea, (d) HIV-infected patients without clinical and parasitological evidence of Cryptosporidium infection and (e) AIDS patients with cryptosporidial diarrhea. Antibodies were detected using C. parvum oocysts purified by density gradient centrifugation from bovine faeces. The IgA antibodies were revealed using alpha-chain specific antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with oocysts was used as control. Although high levels of serum antibodies of the IgA class were detected in some donors in the group of healthy adults, elevated values were consistently found in HIV-infected patients. Higher values were found in HIV patients with clinical cryptosporidiosis. The presence of a secretory component in serum IgA antibodies in these patients has been documented. Data indicate that IgA serum antibodies are produced as well as IgM and IgG antibodies upon contact with the parasite, and suggest that elevated IgA serum antibodies to Cryptosporidium are not associated with protection in HIV patients."
9473,0.005,5.0,"In order to verify the occurrence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, 100 HIV/AIDS patients (Group 1) and 85 clinically healthy individuals (Group 2) were submitted to coproparasitological examination. Intestinal parasites were detected in 27% of patients from Group 1 and in 17.6% from Group 2. In Group 1 the most frequent parasites were Strongyloides stercoralis (12%), with 2 cases of hyperinfection; Isospora belli, 7%; Cryptosporidium sp., 4%; with 1 asymptomatic case and hookworm, 4%. Of the infected patients from Group 1 who reported to be chronic alcoholics, 64.3% had strongyloidiasis. Only 6 of the 27 infected patients from Group 1 were on highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In Group 2 the most frequent parasites were S. stercoralis, 7.1%; hookworm, 7.1% and Giardia lamblia, 3.5%. In conclusion, diagnosing intestinal parasites in HIV/AIDS patients is necessary especially in those who report to be chronic alcoholics or are not on antiretroviral treatment."
6407,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects have increased levels of oxidative stress which could impair immunological function and therefore contribute to the progression of AIDS. These characteristics are usually evaluated at rest and responses to exercise have yet to be evaluated. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of a bout of aerobic exercise followed by resistance exercises on antioxidant system in HIV-infected and non-HIV subjects. There were included 14 cases (HIV-positive) and 14 controls (HIV-negative). The exercise protocol consisted of a single session of 20 minutes on a cycloergometer followed by a set of six resistance exercises. The activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase were measured in plasma samples, total glutathione (TGSH) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were measured in erythrocytes. T CD4+ cells, T CD8+, viral load, complete blood count, and white blood count were also assessed. All measurements were performed at three times: baseline, after aerobic exercise, and after resistance exercises. At baseline, the HIV group had lower GST activity than controls, but after the exercise session GST values were similar in both groups. Compared to the control group TGSH was significantly lower in the HIV group at baseline, after aerobic and resistance exercises. The control group presented higher TBARS values after aerobic exercise compared to the HIV group. The neutrophil count was lower in the HIV group after aerobic and resistance exercises. These data indicate that HIV-infected subjects had lower antioxidant activity at rest. Physical exercise stimulated the enzymatic activity similarly in both groups."
5107,0.005,5.0,"Cryptosporidium spp. are a major cause of diarrheal disease in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient individuals. They also cause waterborne disease in both the United States and United Kingdom. Studies on the mechanisms of immunity to cryptosporidiosis indicate the importance of the T-cell response. The spectrum and severity of disease in immunocompromised individuals with cryptosporidiosis reflect this importance since the most severe disease is seen in individuals with defects in the T-cell response. The most commonly studied group is that of patients with AIDS. These patients suffer from more severe and prolonged gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal; in addition, body systems other than the gastrointestinal tract may be affected. The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy does appear to be having a beneficial effect on recovery from cryptosporidiosis and on the frequency of infection in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients. Other diseases that are associated with increased risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, such as primary immunodeficiencies, most notably severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, are also predominantly associated with T-cell defects. Of the remaining groups, children with acute leukemia seem to be most at risk from cryptosporidiosis. There is less evidence of severe complications in patients with other malignant diseases or in those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy."
8784,0.005,5.0,"Pigtailed macaques infected with a virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which morphologically resembles aspects of human HIV-associated TMA. Apoptotic cell death of microvascular endothelial cells might be a pathogenetic clue to this disease. For defining further the pattern of cellular injury in this model, serial kidney sections of 58 macaques infected with HIV-2 and 7 uninfected controls were studied by routine microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, and immunohistochemistry for single-stranded DNA, p53, the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product, caspase-3, and the proliferation marker Ki67. Selected cases were further evaluated by in situ end labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Kidneys of 13 HIV-2-infected animals contained a pattern of cellular injury, which was characterized by (1) nuclear swelling with an ultrastructural morphology different from apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas of renal cells with chromatin nicks (TUNEL positive) and single-stranded DNA, (3) absence of an inflammatory or proliferative response, (4) upregulation of p53 and loss of at least one cellular differentiation marker (Wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a tight correlation with the diagnosis of renal TMA, and (6) a contrast between profound changes in the renal cellular morphology and the apparently unaffected clinical condition of the host. This pattern of injury, which shares some features of both apoptotic and oncotic necrosis, might be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated renal TMA in this model."
8624,0.005,5.0,"The aim of our study was to determine a minimum threshold CD4 count for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation in HIV-infected patients. A schema using longitudinal data from a clinical cohort was designed. The presenting CD4 counts of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients in Hong Kong were evaluated in relation to their progression to AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. A graph was generated to depict the changes in the percentage of cumulative AIDS diagnoses for every 10 cell/microL increase in presenting CD4 count. Of 181 patients, 24 had developed AIDS within 1 year of diagnosis of HIV infection. Setting the CD4 count threshold at 150 cells/microL gave a good balance between the number of preventable AIDS-defining events and the number of non-AIDS patients initiating HAART. No extra AIDS-defining events occurred when the CD4 count threshold was reduced from 200 to 150 cells/microL, despite the addition of 13 more patients. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, presenting CD4 count was a significant predictor for AIDS occurrence. The relative hazard for AIDS occurrence of patients with presenting CD4 counts <or=150 cells/microL was 27-fold greater. We suggest a CD4 count of 150 cells/microL as the minimum threshold for HAART initiation in a cohort of Chinese HIV-infected patients. At this level, 20.8% of the AIDS-defining events could be prevented. While a cut-off of 200 cells/microL remains a standard for considering HAART initiation, the minimum threshold signifies a critical moment for timely intervention to be introduced."
2221,0.005,5.0,"Sequences from the nef/LTR overlap region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) genome were amplified from uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 HIV-2-infected individuals in The Gambia, West Africa. Additional sequences from the plasma of three blood donors were also derived. Analysis of HIV-2 U3 LTR transcription factor elements (PuB-1, p-ets, PuB-2, peri-kappa B, and NF-kappa B sites) indicated a relatively high level of conservation in vivo. The region immediately 3' of the nef termination codon, which exhibits clade-dependent specificity, was targeted by PCR to differentiate HIV-2 subtype A from subtype B infections, the two principal clinical HIV-2 subtypes. All clinical samples analyzed (n = 43) from The Gambia were identified as HIV-2 subtype A by a combination of LTR sequence analysis and subtype-specific amplification of subtypes A and B. Differential PCR amplification of the HIV-2 U3 LTR region represents a rapid means of differentiating subtype A from subtype B infections, the two dominant HIV-2 subtypes that are important in human disease."
1278,0.005,5.0,"HLA and other genetic variants, playing an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, are known to influence tuberculosis (TB) development in HIV-1-positive (HIV+) patients. Because inflammasome genes contribute to HIV-1 susceptibility, we investigated the possible association between polymorphisms in inflammasome genes with HIV-1 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis coinfection (HIV+TB+) in a case/control cohort of Brazilian individuals. Nineteen single-nucleotide polymoprhims in 8 inflammasome genes (NLRP1, NLRP3, AIM2, CARD8, CASP1, IL1B, IL1R, and HSP90) were analyzed in HIV+TB+ Brazilian patients (from Recife, Pernambuco). CARD8 rs6509365 polymorphism was associated with HIV+TB+ (P = 5 × 10(-5)), suggesting a predisposing role of this variant in M. tuberculosis susceptibility in HIV+ subjects (odds ratio = 2.45). This effect is even strong when this allele is combined to CARD8 rs2043211 single-nucleotide polymoprhim. The results of this study support the novel association between CARD8 gene and HIV+TB+ coinfection, demonstrating that inflammasome genetics could influence HIV-1 infection and the development of opportunistic infection."
4699,0.005,5.0,"During the earlier years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, initial reports described sensorineural hearing loss in up to 49% of individuals with HIV/AIDS. During those years, patients commonly progressed to advanced stages of HIV disease and frequently had neurological complications. However, the abnormalities on pure-tone audiometry and brainstem-evoked responses outlined in small studies were not always consistently correlated with advanced stages of HIV/AIDS. Moreover, these studies could not exclude the confounding effect of concurrent opportunistic infections and syphilis. Additional reports also have indicated that some antiretroviral medications may be ototoxic; thus, it has been difficult to make conclusions regarding the cause of changes in hearing function in HIV-infected patients. More recently, accelerated aging has been suggested as a potential explanation for the disproportionate increase in complications of aging described in many HIV-infected patients; hence, accelerated aging-associated hearing loss may also be playing a role in these patients."
4573,0.005,5.0,"Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) used for the treatment of HIV-1 inhibit the replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which may contribute to severe mitochondrial toxicity including lipodystrophy, through the inhibition of polymerase gamma (POLG). Polymorphisms of POLG could explain the variation in mitochondrial toxicity in HIV-1-infected patients. We explored the relationship between selected polymorphisms of POLG and lipodystrophy related to NRTIs. We studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at three amino acid residues (R1142, E1143 and R1146) and the CAG repeats of POLG in a case-control study including HIV-1 treated patients with lipodystrophy (n=69) and 2 controls (without lipodystrophy) per case matched by age, race and sex (n=138). Compared with matched controls, the polymorphisms in E1143 were significantly more frequent in case patients with lipodystrophy (aOR=4.7; p=0.048), and this was associated with a significant decrease of mtDNA in PBMC. In addition, among the parameters tested, the conditional logistic regression showed that the lipodystrophy has a strong link with E1143 polymorphisms, associated with D4T treatment (aOR=9.29, p=0.002). In conclusion, patients harbouring the changes of E1143 in the catalytic site of POLG exhibit a 4-fold increased risk to develop lipodystrophy than HIV-1 treated patients who do not have changes in E1143 and this risk can increase if the patient presenting the SNP received D4T. These could be due to decreased content of mtDNA in PBMC in these patients. Therefore, the toxicity of NRTIs leading to lipodystrophy in some HIV-1 infected patients could be explained in part by the occurrence of POLG polymorphisms."
6917,0.005,5.0,"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity."
10012,0.005,5.0,"The aim of this study was to analyse the lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected adults to compare them with four patients with acute EBV infection. Lymphocyte subsets in 15 healthy controls, 40 HIV-1-infected adults and 4 EBV-infected patients with infectious mononucleosis were analysed by flow cytometry. The immunophenotyping of HIV-1-infected patients in different stages of disease showed a significant reduction in the percentage and absolute count of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, significantly increased percentage of CD8+ T-lymphocytes, inverted CD4/CD8 ratio and an increase in the expression of activation marker HLA-DR compared to controls. The immuno-phenotyping profiles of HIV and EBV infection share some similarities as they both result in the decreased percentage of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes and an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Patients with HIV infection could be distinguished from patients with EBV infection by the absolute lymphocytosis and increased expression of HLA-DR seen in the patients with infectious mononucleosis. In conclusion, both HIV-1 and EBV profoundly change the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood. It is our opinion that flow cytometry could be an aid in the rapid distinguishing of patients with suspected primary HIV-1 infection from those with infectious mononucleosis (before serology data are available)."
9302,0.005,5.0,"Both HCV and HIV are common in haemophiliacs previously treated with non-viral-inactivated clotting factor concentrates. Because of increased bleeding risks, little data are available on the safety of percutaneous outpatient liver biopsy (LBx) and impact of HIV coinfection in this population. This study aims at reporting our experience with percutaneous LBx in a cohort of haemophiliacs infected with HCV and describe the spectrum of disease and impact of HIV coinfection. A retrospective review of consecutive patients with haemophilia and HCV who underwent percutaneous LBx was performed. All patients were positive for HCV RNA by commercial assay and received factor concentrate prior to biopsy. A total of 29 male patients (mean age 36, 24 haemophilia A, five haemophilia B, and 44% coinfected with HIV) underwent successful outpatient percutaneous LBx without bleeding complication. Histologic activity index was 6.44 with advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis) in 31%. When patients were stratified by HIV positive (n = 13) vs. HIV negative (n = 16), coinfected patients had higher fibrosis scores and higher proportion advanced fibrosis (54% vs. 12%; P = 0.0167) with no differences in age, demographic or other laboratory parameters. Multivariate logistic regression found that HIV positivity was independently associated with advanced fibrosis (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.17-11.8; P = 0.026). Outpatient percutaneous LBx can be safely performed in patients with haemophilia. Despite similar age, HIV coinfection was an independent predictor of advanced fibrosis. These data support the hypothesis that HIV accelerates fibrosis progression in those coinfected with HCV and highlights the importance of liver histology in this population."
4589,0.005,5.0,"After the identification of HIV-2 in 1986, most of the cases reported have been concentrated in West Africa. We identified a case of HIV-2 infection in São Paulo, Brazil of a 45-year-old female who presented with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, with a CD4 count of 22 cells/ml. DNA samples from this patient were subjected to end-point PCR amplification of the LTR region. Clones were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. All clones were subtype A related, and four presented an insertion, corresponding to an extra NF-kappaB site. This is the first confirmed case report of an HIV-2-infected subject identified in Brazil whose transmission occurred within the country. Furthermore, the NF-kappaB duplication would potentially be associated with an increase in viral cytopathogenicity. This raises concern for the need for permanent monitoring of the spread of HIV-2 in different areas of the world, even considering its lower rate of transmission and pathogenicity when compared to HIV-1."
7009,0.005,5.0,"IgM, IgG, and HBsAg containing circulating immune complexes (CIC) were determined, by conglutinin (K) and C1q assays, for assessing the role of CIC in hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in 54 HBsAg-negative controls and 85 HBsAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HDV markers (HDV antigen and anti-HD) was 24.70% (21/85). CIC were a common feature of HDV infection with 95.24% of patients having at least one abnormal test result. The prevalence of elevated IgM-K, IgG-K, IgM-C1q, and IgG-C1q CIC were 85.71, 85.71, 57.14, and 85.71%, respectively. The prevalence of IgM class CIC were statistically higher in patients with HDV infection than in those without (P = .001 for the K assay and P = .023 for the C1q assay). There was no difference in the prevalence of IgG class CIC. Patients with HDV infection also have significantly higher median levels of IgM K-CIC (P = .002), IgG K-CIC (P = .049), and IgG C1q-CIC (P = .008). In patients with HDV infection, there was positive correlation between IgM C1q-CIC and transaminase levels (r = .519, P = .016 for AST; r = .500, P = .021 for ALT). There was no difference in the prevalence of HBsAg containing CIC between patients with HDV infection (76.19%) and those without (74.60%). In conclusion, IgM class CIC are the major CIC and correlate with disease activity in HDV infection. CIC may play a role in the pathogenesis of HDV infection."
8443,0.005,5.0,A complementarity-determining region (CDR) of the mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) F58 was constructed with specificity to a neutralization-inducing region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The mAb has its major reactivity to the amino acid sequence I--GPGRA in the V3 viral envelope region. All CDRs including several framework amino acids were synthesized from the sequence deduced by cloning and sequencing mAb F58 heavy- and light-chain variable domains. Peptides derived from the third heavy-chain domain (CDR-H3) alone or in combination with the other CDR sequences competed with F58 mAb for the V3 region. The CDR-H3 peptide was chemically modified by cyclization and then inhibited HIV-1 replication as well as syncytium formation by infected cells. Both the homologous IIIB viral strain to which the F58 mAb was induced and the heterologous SF2 strain were inhibited. This synthetic peptide had unexpectedly potent antiviral activity and may be a potential tool for treatment of HIV-infected persons.
5786,0.005,5.0,"Patients with treated HIV-1-infection experience earlier occurrence of aging-associated diseases, raising speculation that HIV-1-infection, or antiretroviral treatment, may accelerate aging. We recently described an age-related co-methylation module comprised of hundreds of CpGs; however, it is unknown whether aging and HIV-1-infection exert negative health effects through similar, or disparate, mechanisms. We investigated whether HIV-1-infection would induce age-associated methylation changes. We evaluated DNA methylation levels at >450,000 CpG sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of young (20-35) and older (36-56) adults in two separate groups of participants. Each age group for each data set consisted of 12 HIV-1-infected and 12 age-matched HIV-1-uninfected samples for a total of 96 samples. The effects of age and HIV-1 infection on methylation at each CpG revealed a strong correlation of 0.49, p<1 x 10(-200) and 0.47, p<1 x 10(-200). Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified 17 co-methylation modules; module 3 (ME3) was significantly correlated with age (cor=0.70) and HIV-1 status (cor=0.31). Older HIV-1+ individuals had a greater number of hypermethylated CpGs across ME3 (p=0.015). In a multivariate model, ME3 was significantly associated with age and HIV status (Data set 1: βage=0.007088, p=2.08 x 10(-9); βHIV=0.099574, p=0.0011; Data set 2: βage=0.008762, p=1.27 x 10(-5); βHIV=0.128649, p=0.0001). Using this model, we estimate that HIV-1 infection accelerates age-related methylation by approximately 13.7 years in data set 1 and 14.7 years in data set 2. The genes related to CpGs in ME3 are enriched for polycomb group target genes known to be involved in cell renewal and aging. The overlap between ME3 and an aging methylation module found in solid tissues is also highly significant (Fisher-exact p=5.6 x 10(-6), odds ratio=1.91). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with methylation patterns that are similar to age-associated patterns and suggest that general aging and HIV-1 related aging work through some common cellular and molecular mechanisms. These results are an important first step for finding potential therapeutic targets and novel clinical approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of both HIV-1-infection and aging."
7777,0.005,5.0,"CCR5 is an important chemokine receptor involved in the recruitment of specific anti-viral immune cells (e.g., NK cells and T cytotoxic cells) to the liver. Previous studies indicated that the Δ 32 mutation in CCR5 gene led to inactivation of CCR5. Several conflicting studies have suggested that this mutation may be associated with either recovery or persistence of HBV infection. The main purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of the Δ 32 mutation within the CCR5 gene in a group of patients infected chronically with HBV with healthy individuals from South-East of Iran. Sixty patients with chronic HBV infection as well as 300 age-, and sex-match healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Gap-PCR was applied to determine the frequency of CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in both groups. The results demonstrated that none of the patients infected with HBV carried the CCR5 Δ 32 mutation while, 3 (1%) of the healthy individuals were found to be heterozygotic for this mutation. The CCR5 Δ 32 mutation is not a prevalent mutation in either the patients infected chronically with HBV or their health counterparts in the South-East region of Iran. This may be attributed to either different genetic settings of the investigated population or lack of any significant correlation between this mutation and HBV pathogenicity."
321,0.005,5.0,"Nosocomial multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people is recognized in Europe and America. We report the first such outbreak in South Africa. Six hospitalized women, identified by DNA fingerprinting, were infected with an outbreak strain of MDR-TB while receiving treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. The putative source case was identified as an HIV-positive woman who underwent prolonged hospitalization for chronic cavitary tuberculosis. Compared with other HIV-positive patients in the hospital, outbreak patients were more immunocompromised, had fewer cavitary lung changes, and were less likely to have been treated before. They had high fevers, infiltrative patterns on chest radiographs, and a mean survival of 43 days. When individual isolation is not possible, separating highly immunocompromised patients with first-time tuberculosis from previously treated patients with cavitary lesions and from those with established drug resistance may reduce nosocomial transmission."

9709,0.005,5.0,"The HIV and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) epidemics are closely linked. In Thailand as part of a sentinel surveillance system, we collected data prospectively about pulmonary TB cases treated in public clinics. A subset of HIV-infected TB patients identified through this system had additional data collected for a research study. We conducted multivariate analysis to identify factors associated with MDR-TB. Of 10,428 TB patients, 2,376 (23%) were HIV-infected; 145 (1%) had MDR-TB. Of the MDR-TB cases, 52 (37%) were HIV-infected. Independent risk factors for MDR-TB included age 18-29 years old, male sex, and previous TB treatment, but not HIV infection. Among new patients, having an injection drug use history was a risk factor for MDR-TB. Of 539 HIV-infected TB patients in the research study, MDR-TB was diagnosed in 19 (4%); the only significant risk factors were previous TB treatment and previous hepatitis. In Thailand, HIV is common among MDR-TB patients, but is not an independent risk factor for MDR-TB. Populations at high risk for HIV-young adults, men, injection drug users - should be prioritized for drug susceptibility testing."

We investigated sub-optimal adherence according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill assessment methods, and their associated factors among HIV-infected adults receiving cART in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Eight-hundred seventy patients who initiated cART between May 2009 and April 2012 were randomly selected, and 664 patients who were alive, had remained in clinical care and were receiving cART for at least six-months were included. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as patients' response of less than ""all-of the time"" to the self-report adherence question, or any clinician-recorded poor adherence during the six most recent clinic visits, or a pharmacy-refill of <95% medication possession ratio (MPR). Logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with sub-optimal adherence. The average adherence level to cART, expressed as MPR, was nearly 97%. However, sub-optimal adherence occurred in 12%, 4%, and 27% of patients according to self-report, clinician-recorded, and pharmacy-refill measures, respectively. More satisfaction with social support was significantly associated with less sub-optimal adherence according to self-report and clinician-record. Younger age, lower educational level, and lower CD4 cell count at cART initiation were significantly associated with sub-optimal refill-based adherence. Findings from our large multi-center study suggest that sub-optimal adherence was present in up to a quarter of the patients, despite a high degree of average adherence to cART. Interventions aimed at preventing sub-optimal adherence should focus on improving social support, on younger patients, on patients with lower educational level, and on those who started cART at a lower CD4 cell count."
1255,0.005,5.0,"Fluconazole inhibits cytochrome P-450-mediated enzymatic metabolism of several drugs. Since hepatic metabolism is partially responsible for 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine or ddI) elimination, fluconazole therapy may lead to increased ddI concentrations in serum and subsequent concentration-dependent adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to determine if ddI pharmacokinetics are influenced by a 7-day course of oral fluconazole. Twelve adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had received a constant dosage of ddI for at least 2 weeks were investigated. On study day 1, multiple serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were obtained over 12 h. Then subjects received a 7-day course of oral fluconazole (200 mg every 12 h for two doses and then 200 mg once daily for 6 days) while ddI therapy continued. Following the last dose of fluconazole, serum samples for determination of ddI concentrations were again obtained over 12 h. ddI concentrations in serum were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. In contrast to previously published data, there was marked between-subject variability in ddI areas under the concentration-time curve, even when the dose was normalized for weight. No significant differences were found between mean ddI areas under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h on study day 1 (1,528 +/- 902 ngx.hr/ml) and following fluconazole treatment (1,486 +/- 649 ngx.hr/ml) . There were no significant differences in other pharmacokinetic parameters, such as ddI peak concentrations in serum (971 +/- 509 and 942 +/- 442 ng/ml) or half-lives (80 +/- 32 and 85 +/- 21 min.) before and after fluconazole treatment, respectively. We conclude that a 7-day course of oral fluconazole does not significantly alter ddI pharmacokinetics in adults that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
3509,0.005,5.0,"There are approximately 240 million patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide. Up to 40% of HBV-infected patients can progress to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or chronic end-stage liver disease during their lifetime. This, in turn, is responsible for around 650000 deaths annually worldwide. Repeated hepatitis flares may increase the progression of liver fibrosis, making the accurate diagnosis of the stage of liver fibrosis critical in order to make antiviral therapeutic decisions for HBV-infected patients. Liver biopsy remains the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing liver fibrosis. However, this technique has recently been challenged by the development of several novel noninvasive tests to evaluate liver fibrosis, including serum markers, combined models and imaging techniques. In addition, the cost and accessibility of imaging techniques have been suggested as additional limitations for invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in developing countries. Therefore, a noninvasive assessment model has been suggested to evaluate liver fibrosis, specifically in HBV-infected patients, owing to its high applicability, inter-laboratory reproducibility, wide availability for repeated assays and reasonable cost. The current review aims to present the status of knowledge in this new and exciting field, and to highlight the key points in HBV-infected patients for clinicians. "
2964,0.005,5.0,"An important driving force behind the sequence diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is viral adaptation to host immune responses. To gain an insight into the impact of host immunity on genetic diversification and properties of HBV, we characterized HBV of genotype D from treatment-naive hepatitis B e antigen-positive (EP) and hepatitis B e antigen-negative (EN) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), where HBV is under stronger immune pressure, with that of HBV derived from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV-coinfected individuals, where HIV infection has significantly weakened the immune system. Full-length sequence analysis showed that HBV heterogeneity was most extensive in EN-CHB followed by EP-CHB and HIV/HBV coinfection. The relative magnitude of non-synonymous changes within B-cell epitopes was greater than that in T-cell epitopes of HBV open reading frames (ORFs) in both EP-CHB and EN-CHB. Nine amino acid substitutions were identified in B-cell epitopes and one in a T-cell epitope of HBV in EN-CHB, most of which resulted in altered hydrophobicities, as determined using the Kyte and Doolittle method, relative to wild-type residues found in HBV from the HIV-positive group. Additionally, 19 substitutions occurred at significantly higher frequencies in non-epitope regions of HBV ORF-P in EN-CHB than HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. In vitro replication assay demonstrated that the substitutions, particularly in reverse transcriptase and RNaseH domains of ORF-P, resulted in a decline in replication capacity of HBV. Hence, our results indicate that HBV adapts to increasing immune pressure through preferential mutations in B-cell epitopes and by replicative attenuation. The viral epitopes linked to immune response identified in this study bear important implications for future HBV vaccine studies."
3566,0.005,5.0,"In 1994, the US Public Health Service published guidelines for the use of zidovudine to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 1995, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the US Public Health Service recommended documented, routine HIV education and testing with consent for all pregnant women in the United States. Widespread incorporation of these guidelines into clinical practice has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the rate of perinatal HIV transmission and has contributed to more than a 75% decrease in reported cases of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) since 1992. Substantial advances have been made in the treatment and monitoring of HIV infection; combination antiretroviral regimens that maximally suppress virus replication are now available. These regimens are recommended for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals who require treatment. Risk factors associated with perinatal HIV transmission are now better understood, and recent results from trials to decrease the rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission have contributed new strategies with established efficacy. However, perinatal HIV transmission still occurs; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 300 to 400 infected infants are born annually. Full implementation of recommendations for universal, routine prenatal HIV testing and evaluation of missed prevention opportunities will be critical to further decrease the incidence of pediatric HIV infection in the United States. This technical report summarizes recent advances in the prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV relevant to screening of pregnant women and their infants."
4323,0.005,5.0,"Fitness disadvantage of the transitional intermediates compared to the initial R5 viruses has been suggested to constitute one of the blockades to coreceptor switching, explaining the late appearance of X4 viruses. Using a simian model for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) coreceptor switching, we demonstrate in this study that similar molecular evolutionary pathways to coreceptor switch occur in more than one R5 simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)(SF162P3N)-infected macaque. In infected animals where multiple pathways for expansion or switch to CXCR4 coexist, fitness of the transitional intermediates in coreceptor usage efficiency influences their outgrowth and representation in the infecting virus population. Dualtropic and X4 viruses appear at different disease stages, but they have lower entry efficiency than the coexisting R5 strains, which may explain why they do not outcompete the R5 viruses. Similar observations were made in two infected macaques with coreceptor switch, providing in vivo evidence that fitness disadvantage is an obstacle to X4 emergence and expansion."
615,0.005,5.0,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule of the innate immune system and a competent to bind carbohydrates of a variety of microorganisms, resulting in complement activation and opsonophagocytosis against various pathogens. However, there is no systemic investigation on the MBL's role in innate immune responses against HIV-1 infection among northern Han Chinese. This study investigated the association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. A total of 91 HIV-1 infected patients and 91 HIV-1 seronegative healthy individuals were recruited. Six polymorphisms of MBL2 gene were genotyped by pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of serum MBL concentration and MBL complex activity were performed by ELISA. The CD4+ T-cell counts were determined by flow cytometry. The plasma viral loads of 91 HIV-1 infected patients were determined by bDNA method. The results show that there is an association between MBL and HIV-1 infection susceptibility among northern Han Chinese. The individuals with B variant, low serum MBL concentration and low MBL complex activity are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection."
6558,0.005,5.0,"The identification of various risk factors of vertical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission resulted in the development of strategies whose aim was to decrease the mother's viral load, to reduce her child's exposure to it during delivery, and to avoid the subsequent viral exposure due to breastfeeding. The administration of antiretroviral treatment during pregnancy, delivery and to the neonate (PACTG 076) proved to be useful. At a first stage, zidovudine was used. A triple combination therapy was then administered. Initially, the viral transmission in mothers who were enrolled in protocols for vertically transmitted HIV prophylaxis was reduced to 9.5%, whereas the last measurement carried out between 1998 and 2005, the initial figure was brought down to 2%. Nevertheless, the delivery of infected children whose mother's HIV status was unknown is still considered likely to happen. The main step to be taken to reduce HIV infection among children is to perform universal HIV tests during pregnancy, so that HIV positive pregnant patients conveniently receive proper prophylaxis. We look forward to achieving this by following the new prevention guidelines of vertically-transmitted HIV infection, developed by the Comisión Nacional del SIDA of the Chilean Health Ministry."
2776,0.005,5.0,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a PCR-based qualitative test for the rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracellulare complex (MAC) bacteremia in patients with AIDS disease. Eleven subjects with newly culture-proven MAC bacteremia had the following tests performed at biweekly intervals during the first 8 weeks of therapy: blood culture, Mycobacterium-specific PCR, and quantitative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral-load testing. Mycobacterium genus-specific biotinylated primers were used to amplify a sequence of approximately 582 nucleotides within the 16S rRNA genes of M. avium and M. intracellulare. Detection of the amplified product was performed with an oligonucleotide probe-coated microwell plate combined with an avidin-horseradish peroxidase-tetramethylbenzidine conjugate-substrate system. While not as sensitive as BACTEC culture, PCR detected 17 of 18 specimens which grew >/=40 organisms/ml (94.4% sensitivity) and 9 of 16 specimens which grew </=40 organisms/ml (56.3% sensitivity). No clear change in HIV viremia occurred in response to successful treatment of patients' MAC bacteremia. Use of the PCR test allowed detection of MAC bacteremia in 1 day, with a sensitivity similar to those of quantitative blood culture techniques, and it may prove useful for rapid screening of suspected cases. HIV viremia was unaffected by 8 weeks of MAC therapy."
7444,0.005,5.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the performance of 4 biologic tests designed to detect recent HIV-1 infections in estimating incidence in West Africa (BED, Vironostika, Avidity, and IDE-V3). These tests were assessed on a panel of 135 samples from 79 HIV-1-positive regular blood donors from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, whose date of seroconversion was known (Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales 1220 cohort). The 135 samples included 26 from recently infected patients (< or =180 days), 94 from AIDS-free subjects with long-standing infection (>180 days), and 15 from patients with clinical AIDS. The performance of each assay in estimating HIV incidence was assessed through simulations. The modified commercial assays gave the best results for sensitivity (100% for both), and the IDE-V3 technique gave the best result for specificity (96.3%). In a context like Abidjan, with a 10% HIV-1 prevalence associated with a 1% annual incidence, the estimated test-specific annual incidence rates would be 1.2% (IDE-V3), 5.5% (Vironostika), 6.2% (BED), and 11.2% (Avidity). Most of the specimens falsely classified as incident cases were from patients infected for >180 days but <1 year. The authors conclude that none of the 4 methods could currently be used to estimate HIV-1 incidence routinely in Côte d'Ivoire but that further adaptations might enhance their accuracy."
446,0.005,5.0,"The paper describes some preliminary attempts to formulate simple mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of HIV infection in homosexual communities. In conjunction with a survey of the available epidemiological data on HIV infection and the incidence of AIDS, the models are used to assess how various processes influence the course of the initial epidemic following the introduction of the virus. Models of the early stages of viral spread provide crude methods for estimating the basic reproductive rate of the virus, given a knowledge of the incubation period of the disease (AIDS) and the initial doubling time of the epidemic. More complex models are formulated to assess the influence of variation in the incubation period and heterogeneity in sexual activity. The latter factor is shown to have a major effect on the predicted pattern of the epidemic; high levels of heterogeneity decrease its magnitude. Areas of biological uncertainty, future research needs, and public health implications are discussed."
2383,0.005,5.0,"We review studies examining the quality and quantity of social relationships as potential risk factors for differential progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several well-conducted prospective studies suggest that the health effects associated with the presence of supportive social relationships vary according to disease stage and mode of transmission. For gay or bisexual males in the early stages of infection, the presence of supportive social relationships appears to be a risk factor for accelerated disease progression. For individuals in the later stages of infection and those who acquire HIV via intravenous drug use or transfusion, supportive social relationships appear to be associated with health protective effects similar to those observed in other disease settings. We consider a variety of potential explanations for accelerated disease progression in gay men with extensive networks of personal relationships."
9519,0.005,5.0,"Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status."

1383,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection during pregnancy is a condition that requires multidisciplinary care. Care must be rendered that is appropriate for both the mother and the fetus. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is of paramount concern. To prevent transmission, universal testing for HIV infection in pregnant women is ideal. In the United States and other developed countries, great strides have been made toward decreasing the risk of HIV transmission to infants to <2% with use of a combination of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the antepartum period and during labor and delivery, scheduled cesarean section when appropriate, avoidance of breast-feeding, and 6 weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis for infants. The continuation of antiretroviral therapy after delivery depends on the needs of the mother with regard to treatment of her own health. In resource-limited countries, where simplified and shortened courses of antiretroviral regimens have been used, reduction in mother-to-child transmission has also been shown, although not as effectively as that with highly active antiretroviral therapy. In these settings, exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months is recommended to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission."
6570,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with solid tumor or hematological malignancies. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to hepatitis flare and/or hepatic decompensation. These consequences arising from HBV reactivation are, however, largely preventable. Routine screening for HBV serologic status is recommended for all cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or biologics. By recognizing different serological patterns (which represent either overt or occult HBV infection) and the types of immunosuppressive therapies prescribed, a risk-adapted approach can be established. Prophylactic therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues (prior to or concomitantly with the commencement of immunosuppressive therapies) is more effective than pre-emptive therapy (starting antiviral when HBV DNA level is rising) in high-risk individuals. Entecavir has been proven to be more effective than lamivudine according to recent studies. Close monitoring of serum HBV level is the preferred strategy in low-risk patients. However, the optimal interval of DNA monitoring and the duration of therapy remain unknown. "

7846,0.005,5.0,"The rapidity of HIV-RNA suppression after initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) may impact immune reconstitution in developing countries, where patients initiate cART at low CD4 T cell counts. One hundred and thirty-five HIV-1 Mozambican adults initiating cART were prospectively followed over 16 months within a larger observational study. Plasma HIV-RNA, CD4 counts, and CD8 T cell activation were monitored at the pre-cART visit and at 4, 10, and 16 months during cART. Of the 89 patients with available HIV-RNA data at pre-cART and 4 and 10 months post-cART, 68% (60/89) suppressed HIV-RNA at 4 months and were defined as ""early virological controllers""(EC). Twenty of the 29 remaining patients who did not control HIV-RNA at 4 months did so at 10 months and were classified as ""late virological controllers""(LC). Nine (10%) patients did not control HIV-RNA at either time point. Both initiating an EFV-containing cART regimen and having pre-cART tuberculosis were significantly associated with early HIV-RNA suppression if locked into a multivariate model [EFV OR: 13.6 (95% CI 1.7; 108.1) p = 0.014) tuberculosis OR: 11.0 (95% CI 1.4; 87.9) p = 0.024]. EC demonstrated significantly lower median activated CD8 T cells at 4, 10, and 16 months post-cART than did LC. Approximately 63% (12/19) of LC experienced reappearance of detectable HIV-RNA at 6 months postcontrol as compared to 15% (2/60) of EC (p = 0.001). This study suggests that rapid suppression of HIV-RNA may lead to a lower rate of reappearance of HIV-RNA, which could impact CD8 T cell activation levels in patients initiating cART at low CD4 counts."

Significant associations were found between HAV and HBV infection, HAV and HCV infection, and HBV and HCV infection. Predictors of total co-infections included age of first injection, lifetime years in jail, and Hispanic ethnicity. Latinos had the highest proportion of HAV and HBV co-infection with HCV. The total number of co-infections, especially those co-infected with all three of the hepatitis infections, was unexpectedly high."

This article systematically reviews recent research advances in the possible barriers of hepatitis B care in APIAs that can be classified into three major categories, i.e., provider-, patient-, and resource-related barriers. The article also provides an overview of multiple approaches to effectively reduce these barriers so that we can evolve better strategy and deliver appropriate care to this special population and eventually reduce health disparity of CHB in APIAs."
3134,0.005,5.0,"As a result of shared modes of transmission, chronic hepatitis C infection is common in HIV-infected patients, particularly among those who have used injection drugs as well as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, HCV infection has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last decade, treatment with peginterferon (PEG-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) has been recommended for coinfected patients who are at the greatest risk for liver disease; however, the effectiveness of HCV treatment in this population has been disappointing. Challenges to the use of HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, patients with HIV/HCV coinfection include the potential for interactions between different drugs, addition of drug toxicities, and the need for therapy with PEG-IFN. Despite these challenges, limited data indicate that telaprevir and boceprevir given in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV increase the rate of viral suppression in coinfected patients with manageable toxicity and drug-drug interaction profile. Accordingly, these agents may be recommended for HCV treatment in carefully selected HIV-infected persons."

Median age at presentation was 67 years, and five were female. Nine were asymptomatic at presentation, six presented with varices, five with malaise, three with abdominal pain, one with pruritus and one with oedema. Risk factors identified were: transfusion (7), haemodialysis (1), health care worker (dentist) (1), and tattoos (2). There was no recognized risk factor for infection in 14, but five of these had done military service in areas of high HCV prevalence. Liver biopsy in 20 showed chronic hepatitis in two, cirrhosis in 12, and cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in six. Three additional patients also developed hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genotyping was done in 19 and all were type 1 (1a, 4; 1b, 14; 1 untypable, 1).

4239,0.005,5.0,"The progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2(HSV-1/2), and Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections."
3059,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an important cause of human chronic liver diseases and is a major public health problem. Viral load and HBV genotype play critical roles in determining clinical outcomes and response to antiviral treatment in hepatitis B patients. Viral genotype detection and quantification assays are currently in use with different levels of effectiveness. In this study, the performance of a real-time genotyping and quantitative PCR (GQ-PCR)-based assay was evaluated. Through the use of genotype-specific primers and probes, this assay provides simultaneous identification and quantification of genotypes B and C in a single reaction. Our GQ-PCR correctly identified all predefined genotypes B and C, and no cross-reaction between genotypes B and C were observed. The GQ-PCR identified more cases of HBV infections with mixed genotypes B and C than direct sequencing did. Samples from 127 HBV-infected Chinese patients were genotyped with GQ-PCR, revealing 56.7% HBV as genotype B, 13.4% as genotype C, and 29.8% as mixed genotypes B and C. This assay provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective means for quantification of the B and C genotypes of HBV in single or mixed infections. This assay is suitable for sequential monitoring of viral load levels and for determining the relationship between the genotype viral load and stage of disease in Asians."
3666,0.005,5.0,"Active TB in HIV-1-infected subjects is associated with increased HIV-1-related immunodeficiency and mortality. We assessed plasma viral load in HIV-1-infected patients with pulmonary TB (HIV/TB) and non-TB symptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (HIV). HIV-1 load was higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV at higher CD4 counts (> 500/microl) (P < 0.01), but not at lower CD4 counts (< 500/microl). We also evaluated the status of HIV-1 gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum from HIV/TB and CD4-matched healthy HIV-infected patients (HIV/C) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction over a range of CD4 (> 900/microl to < 200/microl). HIV-1 RNA in serum and PBMC correlated to one another, and both were markedly higher in HIV/TB compared with HIV/C with higher CD4 counts. Also, during a longitudinal study of anti-tuberculous chemoprophylaxis in HIV-1-infected patients, 10 subjects who developed TB had serologies before, at the time, and after the diagnosis of TB. These HIV/TB patients had an increase in viral load (average 2.5-fold) at the time of diagnosis of TB (P < 0.05). Overall, these data indicate that the transcriptional activity of HIV-1 is enhanced in HIV-1-infected patients with active TB, especially during early HIV-1 disease. As TB often is an early HIV-1 opportunistic infection, it may particularly favour early viral replication and dissemination, and therefore contribute to progression of HIV-1 disease."
2984,0.005,5.0,"The objective was to evaluate the association between antiretroviral therapy and AIDS mortality in New York City (NYC). Design was a population-based case-control study. We randomly selected 150 case patients and 150 control patients whose AIDS diagnosis was made during 1994 to 1996 (male:female, 2:1) from among 19,238 persons reported to the NYC Health Department HIV/AIDS Reporting System (HARS). Case patients had died of AIDS-related causes in 1996. Control patients, category matched with case patients on gender, were not known to have died by the end of 1996. Analysis was performed on 279 patients (142 cases and 137 controls). Cases and controls were similar in age, gender, race, HIV transmission category, and health insurance coverage. The median baseline CD4 count was 30 cells/microL for those who died and 103 cells/microL for survivors (p < 0.001). The prescription of HAART (antiretroviral combination that includes at least one protease inhibitor) in 1996 was strongly associated with survival in univariate analysis (OR = 5.1, 95%CI = 2.5-10.2). This association remained in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for sex, age, race, health insurance status, HIV transmission categories, year of AIDS diagnosis, baseline CD4 count, and other antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI = 3.5-20.7). Prescription of combination therapy other than HAART in 1996 and baseline CD4 count were also associated with survival, but less strongly so. The survival benefit of HAART extends beyond the confines of a few highly selected patients into the ""real world,"" reducing AIDS deaths at the population level. This population-based study supports the likelihood that the introduction of HAART in 1996 played a primary role in the decline in NYC AIDS mortality."
1307,0.005,5.0,"Hemodialysis patients potentially have an increased risk of infection with parenterally transmitted viral agents due to an impaired host immune response and multiple transfusion requirements. Viral hepatitis is considered as a problem for hemodialysis patients because 1.9% of all deaths among this population are related to the consequence of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important causes of transmitted infections by the parenteral route in hemodialysis patients. Occult HBV infection is characterized by presence of HBV infection without detectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which harbors potential risk of HBV transmission through hemodialysis. There are conflicting reports on the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) in hemodialysis patients. Considering the importance of occult HBV infection in hemodialysis patients and the growing evidence on this subject, the purpose of this review is to provide comprehensive information on OBI prevalence in hemodialysis patients and highlight the most important points in this issue."
6839,0.005,5.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (Viracept, formally AG1343) is a potent and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (K(i) = 2 nM) and is being widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection. The current studies evaluated the presence of metabolites circulating in plasma following the oral administration of nelfinavir to healthy volunteers and HIV-infected patients, as well as the levels in plasma and antiviral activities of these metabolites. The results showed that the parent drug was the major circulating chemical species, followed in decreasing abundance by its hydroxy-t-butylamide metabolite (M8) and 3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxynelfinavir (M1). Antiviral assays with HIV-1 strain RF-infected CEM-SS cells showed that the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of nelfinavir, M8, and M1 were 30, 34, and 151 nM, respectively, and that the corresponding EC50 against another HIV-1 strain, IIIB, in MT-2 cells were 60, 86, and 653 nM. Therefore, apparently similar in vitro antiviral activities were demonstrated for nelfinavir and M8, whereas an approximately 5- to 11-fold-lower level of antiviral activity was observed for M1. The active metabolite, M8, showed a degree of binding to human plasma proteins similar to that of nelfinavir (ca. 98%). Concentrations in plasma of nelfinavir and its metabolites in 10 HIV-positive patients receiving nelfinavir therapy (750 mg three times per day) were determined by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay. At steady state (day 28), the mean plasma nelfinavir concentrations ranged from 1.73 to 4.96 microM and the M8 concentrations ranged from 0.55 to 1.96 microM, whereas the M1 concentrations were low and ranged from 0.09 to 0.19 microM. In conclusion, the findings from the current studies suggest that, in humans, nelfinavir forms an active metabolite circulating at appreciable levels in plasma. The active metabolite M8 may account for some of the antiviral activity associated with nelfinavir in the treatment of HIV disease."
1516,0.005,5.0,"To achieve global targets for universal treatment set forth by the Joint United Nations Programme on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (UNAIDS), viral load monitoring for HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) must become the standard of care in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (1). CDC and other U.S. government agencies, as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, are supporting multiple countries in sub-Saharan Africa to change from the use of CD4 cell counts for monitoring of clinical response to ART to the use of viral load monitoring, which is the standard of care in developed countries. Viral load monitoring is the preferred method for immunologic monitoring because it enables earlier and more accurate detection of treatment failure before immunologic decline. This report highlights the initial successes and challenges of viral load monitoring in seven countries that have chosen to scale up viral load testing as a national monitoring strategy for patients on ART in response to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Countries initiating viral load scale-up in 2014 observed increases in coverage after scale-up, and countries initiating in 2015 are anticipating similar trends. However, in six of the seven countries, viral load testing coverage in 2015 remained below target levels. Inefficient specimen transport, need for training, delays in procurement and distribution, and limited financial resources to support scale-up hindered progress. Country commitment and effective partnerships are essential to address the financial, operational, technical, and policy challenges of the rising demand for viral load monitoring. "
5219,0.005,5.0,"Important progress has been made in recent years in the development and clinical use of drugs for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Nevertheless, when antiretroviral therapy fails to be fully suppressive, new viral variants emerge, thus allowing HIV-1 to escape from drug pressure by accumulating mutations. Between 50% and 70% of treated patients with virological rebound harbour some form of drug-resistant virus; transmitted drug resistance in drug-naïve populations has reached 5-20% in areas of the world with access to treatment. The emergence of drug-resistant viruses remains the limiting factor in HIV-1 management, being a major cause of treatment failure, and being associated with clinical progression and death. All international guidelines focus on the importance of tailoring antiretroviral therapy to the individual patient, on the basis onf HIV-1 genetic data, integrated with clinical, laboratory and therapeutic information. The aim of this review is to provide useful information to clinicians and virologists about how and when to use genotypic resistance testing in clinical practice, especially in the management of the first stages of HIV-1 patient care and treatment decisions."
4625,0.005,5.0,"Twenty-four of over 24,000 patients genotyped over the past 3 years were found to have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene insertion mutations in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various insertion mutations on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, insertion mutations can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication."
5796,0.005,5.0,"The molecular epidemiological study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Indonesia is still limited. This study was aimed to identify the prevalence of HBV pre-S deletion/insertion mutations, and to assess the association of pre-S deletion mutation with liver disease progression in Indonesia. Pre-S mutations were identified by direct sequencing. Of the 265 subjects, 32 samples (12.1%) harbored pre-S deletion/insertion mutations. The prevalence of those pre-S mutations was 2.7% (2/75), 12.9% (8/62), 16.7% (11/66), and 17.7% (11/62) in asymptomatic carrier, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma groups, respectively. Statistical analysis showed significant difference among them (P = 0.024). In HBV genotype B (HBV/B), pre-S1, pre-S1/S2, and pre-S2 deletion mutations were detected respectively in 3 (17.6%), 4 (23.5%), and 9 (52.9%) of 17 samples. On the other hand, in HBV/C, 12 of 15 samples (80.0%) showed a pre-S2 deletion mutation, and only 2 samples (13.3%) demonstrated a pre-S1/S2 deletion mutation. These results suggest that in HBV/B deletion mutation tends to occur in pre-S1 or pre-S1/S2 region, while in HBV/C the deletion mutation usually occurs in the pre-S2 region. Analysis of complete genome of four viruses confirmed that 3 isolates were classified into HBV/B3, and 1 isolate was HBV/C1. However, SimPlot and BootScan analyses showed that isolate 08.10.002 was an intragenotypic recombinant between HBV/B3 and HBV/B4. As conclusion, the prevalence of HBV pre-S mutations was relatively low in Indonesian patients compared to those from Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian countries. There was a weak association between pre-S deletion mutation and progressive liver disease."
5872,0.005,5.0,"Many HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) continue to use illicit substances despite being in substance use treatment. Substance use is associated with non-adherence to HIV medications; however underlying mechanisms regarding this relation are understudied. The current investigation examined the role of substance use coping in terms of the relation between substance use and HIV medication adherence. Participants were 121 HIV-infected IDUs (41 % female, M age = 47, SD = 7.1) in opioid dependence treatment. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, were administered clinical interviews and oral toxicology screens, and used a medication-event-monitoring-system cap to assess 2 week HIV medication adherence. The use of cocaine and multiple substances were significantly related to decreased medication adherence. Substance use coping mediated these associations. Findings highlight the importance of assessing, monitoring, and targeting ongoing substance use, and ways to increase positive coping for HIV-infected IDUs in substance use treatment to aid in HIV medication adherence."
8508,0.005,5.0,"We and others have shown that in individual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, the adaptive evolution of HIV-1 is influenced by host immune competence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that in addition to selective forces operating within the host, transmission bottlenecks have an impact on HIV-1 intrahost evolution. Therefore, we studied the intrahost evolution of the V3 region of the external glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 during the 3- and 5-year periods following seroconversion after parenteral versus sexual (male-to-male) transmission in 41 participants of the Amsterdam prospective cohorts of homosexual men (n = 31) and intravenous drug users (IVDUs; n = 10) who were AIDS free and had comparable numbers of CD4+ cells. We observed that HIV-1 strains in homosexual men accumulated over 5 years more nonsynonymous substitutions within the V3 loop than HIV-1 strains in IVDUs as a result of lower rates of nonsynonymous evolution in both the initial 3-year period from seroconversion and the following 2-year period as well as a larger proportion of nonsynonymous back substitutions in IVDUs. The mean numbers of synonymous substitutions did not differ between the two risk groups. Since HIV-1 strains in IVDUs could be distinguished from the viruses of homosexual men based on several nucleotide substitutions of which the most conserved is a synonymous substitution at the tip of the V3 loop (GGC pattern), we studied whether the founder virus population itself has an impact on the intrahost evolution of HIV-1. The mean number of nonsynonymous substitutions accumulated over 5 years within the V3 loop was lower in 10 IVDUs infected by the HIV-1 strains with the GGC signature than in 4 IVDUs infected by HIV-1 strains lacking this pattern, while the mean numbers of synonymous substitutions were similar in the two groups."
5450,0.005,5.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global major health problem. Currently, 10 genotypes (A-J) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are identified based on the nucleic acid sequence heterogeneity, and these genotypes have been shown to have distinct geographic distribution. Reports of the previous studies indicated that the genotype D is the predominant type among hepatitis B patients in different regions of Turkey. However, recent studies indicated that other HBV genotypes are also seen with an increasing rate. Although epidemiological and clinical information on genotype E infection is currently limited, it is known that genotype E infection is common in West and Central Africa. In this report, the first case of HBV genotype E infection in Turkey was presented. A 22-year-old Nigerian male employee who resided in Manisa for five years was admitted to Celal Bayar University Hospital Manisa, Turkey, for his routine check-up. Since HBsAg was found positive, other HBV markers were tested with a repeated serum sample. Laboratory findings were as follows; HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), anti-HBc (+), anti-HCV (-), anti-HIV (-), ALT: 44 U/L and AST: 45 U/L. HBV-DNA level was detected as 700 IU/ml by real-time PCR (Artus HBV QS RGQ Qiagen, Germany). HBV-DNA isolated from the serum sample of the patient was amplified by PCR and polymerase gene segment of HBV was directly sequenced. UPGMA method was used for phylogenetic analysis and Inno-LIPA HBV genotyping method (Innogenetics, Belgium) was performed to determine multiple HBV genotype infection. On the basis of those methods the genotype of the virus was identified as genotype E. The partial sequences of the HBV polymerase gene were loaded to the international DNA data bank (GenBank) for contribution to the global HBV surveillance. This report emphasized that besides genotype D the other HBV genotypes could be found in Turkey. Since the patient was an inactive HBsAg carrier before his residence in Turkey, this case was regarded as an imported HBV genotype E case. In conclusion, detection of different HBV genotypes, their epidemiology and molecular characteristics are important for both national and global HBV surveillance and better clinical approach. "

We report a case of spontaneous recovery of chronic HCV-infection in a HCV-HIV co-infected hemophiliac with the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy and immune restoration. Retrospective analysis of frozen blood samples showed that a decrease in HCV-RNA in parallel with the increase of CD4 and CD8-cell counts, accompanied by a peak of transaminases.

33,0.005,5.0,"We report on the frequency of genetic mutations associated with drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients from Martinique (French West Indies), where zidovudine (ZDV) has been available since 1987 and where combination therapy developed simultaneously with its use in continental France. Genotypic resistance was studied in plasma HIV RNA from samples collected between 1988 and 1998 from 70 antiretroviral-naive study subjects, half presenting with either primary infection or documented seroconversion. A line probe assay (LIPA) was used to detect substitutions on the reverse transcriptase (RT) codons 41, 69, 70, 74, 184, and 215. Direct sequencing was used to complete the data for RT codons which were uninterpretable by LIPA. Of these patients, 17 harbored mutated viruses with one or more mutations in the RT gene codons analyzed. ZDV resistance mutations T215Y/F, M41L, and K70R were found in 2, 5, and 12 individuals, respectively. Mutant strains L74V (didanosine [ddI] and dideoxycytidine [ddC]) were detected in 3 patients and M184V (lamivudine/ddI/ddC) in 4 patients. However, pure mutant results at one or more codons of interest were observed in only 5 (7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1%-13%) patients, all involving ZDV resistance. One carried both mutations T215Y and M41L known to confer a high degree of phenotypic resistance to ZDV. Among a subgroup of 28 patients with a timepoint of infection after 1995, 24 [86%; approximately 95% CI, 73%-99%) presented with a wild-type pattern. The significance of the high prevalence of mixed patterns observed in drug-naive patients remains unclear. However, the frequency of primary mutant genotypes associated with high levels of drug resistance is low in Martinique and in this study we did not observe any currently increased tendency in this frequency."
307,0.005,5.0,"In this observational single-center cohort study outside the clinical trial setting, outcome and predictors of virologic failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) containing a protease inhibitor were evaluated in human immunodeficiency (HIV)-infected persons. The study population consisted of 807 protease inhibitor-naive HIV-seropositive patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir) between January 1997 and January 1999. Demographic variable, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, CD4+ T-cell count, adverse drug reactions, and adherence to HAART were assessed. Virologic treatment response was defined as a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA load from baseline to below 500 copies per milliliter after 12 months of therapy. Levels of HIV-1 RNA were undetectable in 43% of patients at 12 months. Factors associated with failure to suppress viral load included age 40 years or younger, baseline CD4+ T cell count less than 200 x 10(6) per liter baseline viral load greater than 4.3 log(10) per milliliter, and non-adherence to HAART. After adjustment by logistic regression, non-adherence was the only statistically significant variable associated with virologic failure (odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.67). Unselected patients in whom protease inhibitor is started in a usual clinical setting achieve viral suppression less frequently than do patients in controlled clinical trials. Failure to adherence to HAART was the strongest predictor of virologic failure."
5487,0.005,5.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) receive numerous medications from multiple providers. As a result, it is important that medication usage is properly documented in each patient's medical record. Lack of adequate documentation may confound a provider's assessment of drug efficacy, potentially leading to an increased incidence of drug interactions and adverse effects. The objective of this study was to determine if discrepancies exist between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record by healthcare providers. Data were obtained using structured telephone surveys and medical chart review. Study participants were recruited from the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center AIDS Clinic. Results obtained for 41 patients demonstrated discrepancies between patient-reported medication usage and that documented in the medical record ranging from 9 to 92 percent, depending on the class of drug. The largest differences were observed with the ""as-needed"" class of drugs: benzodiazepines (92 percent), morphine (60 percent), and codeine (56 percent). Differences were also noted for scheduled medications: ketoconazole (54 percent), clotrimazole (45 percent), acyclovir (38 percent), zidovudine (15 percent), and pentamidine (9 percent). These observed discrepancies reaffirm the need for accurate exchange of information between provider and patient to promote the most effective, rational, and safe drug therapy. Careful reviews of medication usage at each visit and use of pharmacy-based medication profiles are potential mechanisms to improve documentation of medication usage in HIV-infected patients."
2102,0.005,5.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive individuals who adhere to their antiretroviral (ARV) regimens are more likely to achieve suppressed HIV viral load and improved immunologic response; however, for most patients, medication adherence remains a challenge. Prior studies have shown that clinical pharmacists contribute to the management of HIV-infected patients; but due to variability in clinical responsibilities and study limitations, their value has not been fully realized. The objective of this study was to investigate clinical outcomes of an HIV clinical pharmacist's interventions at Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who utilizes medication expertise to provide recommendations for ARV regimen changes. The pharmacist suggests new ARV regimens in order to attain virologic suppression, improve immunologic response, or minimize ARV adverse effects, while aiming to optimize patients' adherence by decreasing pill burden and/or dosing frequency. This retrospective study assessed the effectiveness of the pharmacist's interventions that occurred between 11 September 2006 and 30 September 2008 on pill burden, dosing frequency, and medication adherence. Additionally, CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load pre- and post-intervention were evaluated. Medication adherence was assessed utilizing electronic pharmacy refill records and calculated based on the formula: [(pills dispensed/pills prescribed per day)/days between refills] x 100. From a cohort of 75 patients, mean daily pill quantity and dosing frequency decreased from 7.2 pills/day and 2.0 times/day in the control phase to 5.4 pills/day and 1.5 times/day in the study phase, respectively ( p < 0.001). Medication adherence increased from a mean of 81% in the control phase to 89% in the study phase ( p = 0.003). Clinical outcomes measured by CD4+cell count and CD4% were statistically improved and more individuals achieved undetectable HIV viral loads postintervention ( p < 0.001). In conclusion, HIV clinical pharmacists may play an important role in reducing pill burden and dosing frequency, increasing medication adherence, and improving clinical outcomes."
741,0.005,5.0,"Despite disproportionate rates of HIV among transgender women and evidence that medication adherence is necessary for treatment success and increased likelihood of survival, there has been little investigation into antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence issues among transgender women. This study examined rates of self-reported ART adherence among transgender women on ART (n = 35) and well-established correlates of nonadherence, including depression, adherence self-efficacy, patient perceptions of interactions with their providers, and perceived adverse side effects of ART compared to other respondents (n = 2,770). Transgender women on ART were less likely to report 90% adherence rates or higher and reported less confidence in their abilities to integrate treatment regimens into their daily lives. When transgender women were compared to other respondents, regardless of the current medication regimen, they reported significantly fewer positive interactions with their health care providers. Training for providers and integration of hormone therapy into HIV care is recommended."
6514,0.005,5.0,"Alcohol-antiretroviral therapy (ART) interactive toxicity beliefs reflect perceived adverse outcomes of mixing alcohol and ART. Previous research has shown a significant relationship between alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and ART non-adherence, over and above other correlates of non-adherence such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)symptoms and frequency of alcohol use. Most past studies have collected data over extended periods and have not determined if alcohol use and missed medications occur at the day-level among people holding interactive toxicity beliefs. Previous daily analyses, however, have been limited by self-reported adherence and relatively short periods of observation. To address these gaps in the literature, men and women living with HIV in Atlanta, GA, were enrolled in a 45-day observational cohort study. Daily alcohol use was collected using two-way interactive text message surveys and daily adherence was collected via the Wisepill device. Fifty-seven participants completed a measure of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs and contributed 2565 days of daily data. Participants who endorsed high levels of interactive toxicity beliefs had significantly more days when they missed doses of medication. Alcohol-antiretroviral toxicity beliefs predicted missing doses of medication on days when participants were drinking and on days when they were not drinking. Multilevel multivariate regressions showed that these toxicity beliefs predicted daily missed doses of medication over and above quantity of alcohol consumed, depression and general medication concerns. This study replicates and extends previous literature and indicates the necessity of addressing alcohol-ART toxicity beliefs within adherence interventions."
8240,0.005,5.0,"A survey of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) regarding human immunodeficiency virus infection was performed on 899 students from 3 government-administered high schools located in the Bangkok Metropolitan area. Initially, all students completed a written questionnaire (pre-test) regarding HIV/AIDS. Following this, they attended a slide lecture presentation given by a specialist physician. The same test questionnaire was then completed by the same students six weeks (post-test) later for comparison of their previous KAP. The subjects composed of male to female ratio equal to that of the median age 15-16 years old. Sixty-seven per cent of the subjects were living with their parents, 16.3 per cent with relatives and 15 per cent with friends. Ninety nine per cent of the subjects had received information on HIV/AIDS before enrollment to this study. The source of knowledge ranged from television (89.1%), teachers (81.6%), pamphlets (80.2%), newspapers (75%), radio (55%), health care workers (53.4%), friends (38.6%) and only 32.5 per cent from their parents. The subjects' knowledge about HIV/AIDS and risk factors in the post-test questionnaire was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from the pre-test status. However, their attitudes to an HIV infected person were not significantly changed in the post-test questionnaire: only the ""attending school"" question showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased numbers of agreement. Similarly, the attitudes and practices to prevent HIV infection were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between pre-test and post-test questionnaires. The result of this study is to recommend regular school-based programs of education to increase awareness of preventive strategies for HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases."
2353,0.005,5.0,"Although the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has resulted in a significant decrease of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) morbidity and mortality, the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated dementia (HAD) has actually risen, due to the increasing life expectancy of the infected subjects. To date, several aspects of the HAD pathogenesis remain to be dissected. In particular, the viral-cellular protein interplay is still under investigation. Given their specific features, two viral proteins, Tat and Nef, have been mainly hypothesized to play a role in HIV neuropathology. Here we show that HIV-1 Nef has an effect on the transcriptional levels of a cellular protein, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), that is preferentially expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system at late embryonic stages. By its overexpression along with Nef, the authors demonstrate ALK ability to influence, at least in the U87MG astrocytic glioma cells, the mytogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K)-dependent pathway. Moreover, although in the absence of a physical direct interaction, Nef and ALK activate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are likely to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage in HAD. Finally, in the in vitro model of glioblastoma cells adopted, Nef and ALK show similar effects by increasing different cytochines/chemokines that may be relevant for HAD pathogenesis. If confirmed in vivo, these data may indicate that, thanks to its ability to interfere with specific cellular pathways involved in BBB damage and in central nervous system (CNS) integrity, Nef, along with specific cellular counterparts, could be one of the viral players implicated in HAD development."

This propensity is more pronounced in AIDS, where opportunistic parasitic infections may cause severe diarrhea, marked absorptive dysfunction, and significant risk of mortality. There are scant data regarding parasitic infections among HIV patients in the developed world; most studies and research come from povertystricken areas of South Africa, India, Iran, and the South Pacific. Although multiple infections with the same or different parasites have been reported, simultaneous infections are rare. We present the case of a 35-year-old man who developed a co-infection with Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides, simultaneously, the diagnosis being made after the judicious evaluation of a stool sample. Given the associated morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to avoid further complications in patients with HIV. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of triple parasitic infection in a patient with HIV. "

The stool samples were processed by water-ether sedimentation method; they were stained with Uvitex-2B technique for microscopic detection of intestinal microsporidium. A portion of all samples were preserved in 200microl PBS containing 2% PVPP ((Polyvinylpolypyrolidone) for confirmation with PCR. 18/105(17.2%) of the cases were positive for intestinal microsporidial infection by at least one method. 8/105 (7.6%) positive both by microscopy and PCR and 10/105 (9.5%) were positive only by PCR. All microsporidia positive cases were also HIV positive. Based on PCR analysis, 15 Enterocytozoon bieneusi and 3 Encephalitozoon intestinalis were identified. This study has shown that intestinal microsporidiosis is a common cause of chronic diarrhoea in advanced AIDS patients and this is mainly attributed to Enterocytozoon bieneusi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal microsporidiosis in Ethiopia. It has an important implication for the understanding of the aetiology of diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients in the country."

Residues 79, 94, and 96 were all found to be phosphorylated, as assessed by alanine mutations. Mutation of Ser-79 to Ala abrogated effects of Vpr on cell cycle progression, whereas mutation of Ser-94 and Ser-96 had no effect.

In this study, using sequences obtained from the HIV sequence database, we compared vpu sequences from 184 preparations of various subtypes of HIV-1 from diverse geographical regions. Our analysis revealed that CRF01_AE isolates had premature stop codon mutations at the vpu gene at a much higher rate (36%) than other subtypes (0-9%). The premature stop codon mutations in vpu existed mostly at two amino acid residues: the methionine initiation codon and the boundary between the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic domains. The mutations at the latter site were more often detected in CRF01_AE. The higher mutation rates at vpu in CRF01_AE were confirmed by sequence comparison of polymerase chain reaction products newly obtained directly from the DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but not from the RNA from the plasma, in CRF01_AE- and subtype B-infected individuals. This finding may indicate the possibility that the more abundant population of HIV-1 CRF01_AE is able to induce apoptosis in CD4+ T lymphocytes than the populations of other subtypes."

Out of 297 students, 10.8% had one or more serologic markers of HBV infection; none was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive. No significant difference in seropositivity was detected among students in relation to sex, age, or possible risk factors investigated. Out of 526 practitioners, 2.3% were positive for HBsAg, and 37.3% were antibody positive. The seropositivity increased progressively with age and years of professional experience, reaching the highest proportion in dentists with 30 years or more of practice (79.3%). Of those who had suffered from clinical hepatitis during their curriculum, 81.1% were seropositive compared with 34.5% observed in dentists without a prior clinical history of viral hepatitis. The proportion of seropositive dentists did not vary significantly with a history of blood transfusion, size of their practice, presence or absence (or unawareness) of subjects at high risk for HBV infection among their patients. The seropositivity was significantly lower in dentists who routinely adopted mask and gloves (21.1%) compared with those who never and/or occasionally used such barriers (46.3%). The result of the study confirmed that hepatitis B does remain a significant hazard for dental professionals, hence immunization with hepatitis B vaccine should be delivered early in their employment."

From May 15, 1988, to Sept. 30, 1989, physicians from four collaborating centres collected data on the serologic status, demographic characteristics and risk factors for 4209 patients who underwent HIV antibody testing. Of the 3899 subjects included in the study 7.9% were HIV positive. Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36.5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9.1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8.4), intravenous drug use (POR 4.2), male sex (POR 2.8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2.5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1.8). Over the study period we found a large increase in HIV seroprevalence among intravenous drug users (4.2% in 1988 to 19.0% in 1989) (p = 0.02). This increase might reflect a recent change in the epidemiologic pattern of HIV transmission in Quebec. Surveillance of HIV seropositivity through a network of sentinel physicians may be a reasonable alternative to mandatory reporting."
1806,0.005,5.0,"The Patient Knowledge Assessment Study (PKAS) was conducted among 107 male hemophilic patients, aged 15 to 67 years, at 19 hemophilia treatment centers (HTC). Participants were given a 30-item questionnaire concerning the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the groups at risk, and modes of transmission. The questionnaire included questions on the participant's status in regard to antibody to human T-lymphotropic retrovirus, type III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV), and the meaning of this test result. HTC health-care providers were asked to complete a separate questionnaire containing 17 questions about information given patients concerning their HTLV-III/LAV antibody status and its meaning. Overall, patients had a good base of knowledge about AIDS; however, there were gaps in this knowledge. Twenty-nine percent of patients did not know that spouses of AIDS patients were at risk for AIDS; 47% did not know that sexual partners of persons with hemophilia were at risk; and 32% did not know that hemophilic children were at risk. Further, only 69% understood that antibody-positive individuals had had contact with the AIDS virus. Identifying these and other areas of misunderstanding will provide the information needed to design educational strategies and psychosocial support programs appropriate for the hemophilic population, and which may serve as a model for other populations."
7811,0.005,5.0,"Virological data on chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Greece are limited. HBV genotypes, surface antigen (HBsAg) subtypes, and HBsAg ""a"" determinant mutations among patients infected chronically with HBV, were investigated. Serum samples from 135 HBsAg positive patients were tested. Serologic (HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg, and anti-HBe), virologic (HBV-DNA quantitation) and biochemical markers (serum alanine aminotransferase/ALT and aspartate aminotransferase/AST) were analyzed. HBV genotypes and HBsAg subtypes were determined by partial sequencing of the S gene. Genotyping was performed by using the National Center for Biotechnology Information online Genotyping tool and phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences were aligned pair wise with ClustalW and phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Sequences were also used to predict HBV HBsAg subtypes. In six patients (4%), simultaneous presence of HBsAg and anti-HBs was determined, whereas 47 patients (35%) were HBeAg positive, 84 (62.5%) were anti-HBe positive, and four patients (3%) were characterized by the simultaneous presence of HBeAg and anti-HBe. Mean ALT was 238 IU/L (standard deviation = 576.84), and HBV-DNA levels ranged from 1.02 × 10(5) to 2.2 × 10(7) IU/ml. Genotype D was predominant (98%), with viral groups D/ayw2 (73%) and D/ayw3 (27%). Group A/adw accounted for 1% of cases. Genotypes B and C were found exclusively in the Chinese immigrants (1%). Single or multiple point mutations were found in 35 cases (26%). Some of the most common mutations occurred at amino acid positions 129, 133, 134, 144, 145, including the ""vaccine escape"" mutation G145R. Mutations analysis revealed that amino acid substitutions did not affect detection by commercial immunoassays."
3643,0.005,5.0,"In a retrospective study of 648 persons with HIV infection in Cambodia, we determined the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria to start antiretroviral treatment based on clinical criteria alone or based on a combination of clinical symptoms and the total lymphocyte count. As a reference test, we used the 2003 WHO criteria, including the CD4 count. The 2003 WHO clinical criteria had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 57%, and an accuracy of 89% to identify patients who need highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In our clinic, with a predominance of patients with advanced disease, the 2003 WHO clinical criteria alone was a good predictor of those needing HAART. A total lymphocyte count as an extra criterion did not improve the accuracy. Nine percent of patients were wrongly identified to be in need of HAART. Among them, almost 50% had a CD4 count of more than 500 cells/muL, and 73% had weight loss of more than 10% as a stage-defining condition. Our data suggest that, in settings with limited access to CD4 count testing, it might be useful to target this test to patients in WHO stage 3 whose staging is based on weight loss alone, to avoid unnecessary treatment."
7666,0.005,5.0,"National programmes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination are recommended by the World Health Organization for all countries. Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper."
3208,0.005,5.0,"While the expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, it has increased concern about drug resistance. The Microbicide Trials Network 009 study assessed the prevalence of drug-resistance mutations among women at clinical sites in Durban, South Africa who tested seropositive for HIV-1 at screening for the VOICE trial. The objective of this paper was to identify characteristics and behaviors associated with drug resistance. Factors found to be significantly associated with increased resistance were high perceived risk of getting HIV and prior participation in a microbicide trial, a likely proxy for familiarity with the health care system. Two factors were found to be significantly associated with reduced resistance: having a primary sex partner and testing negative for HIV in the past year. Other variables hypothesized to be important in identifying women with resistant virus, including partner or friend on ART who shared with the participant and being given antiretrovirals during pregnancy or labor, or the proxy variable-number of times given birth in a health facility-were not significantly associated. The small number of participants with resistant virus and the probable underreporting of sensitive behaviors likely affected our ability to construct a comprehensive profile of the type of HIV-positive women at greatest risk of developing resistance mutations.

5506,0.005,5.0,"Genetic variation during the course of infection of an individual is a remarkable feature of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. This variation has been studied for the envelope protein encoding regions of seventeen different sequences from various isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using multiple sequence comparison and calculation of variability. The open regions with little intramolecular base pairing in these envelope sequences are predicted by a recently developed statistical method. The minimum length L for a run of hypervariable sites, conserved sites, or open regions that gives significance at the 1% (or 0.1%) level is then determined by a scan statistical method. The results show that significant clusters of open regions predicted at the RNA levels correlate with significant clusters of hypervariable sites in the HIV envelope gene. Those significant genomic variations in HIVs seem to be manifested mainly in the extracellular portion of the envelope protein. Twelve potential antigenic determinants are predicted using an antigenic index method. Interestingly, the majority of the significant hypervariable regions in the exterior envelope protein (gp120) were predicted potential epitopes."

9785,0.005,5.0,Five hundred and ten inner city adolescent girls requesting reproductive health services were surveyed about their knowledge and beliefs concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Each patient's survey responses were examined in relation to number of sexual partners and history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Adolescents with the greatest concerns and fears of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were those with multiple sexual partners. Those with the joint effects of multiple sexual partners and a history of STD were the most likely to acknowledge their potential for HIV infection and have a behavioral basis for it. Sexual behaviors within this age group are highlighted and programmatic interventions are suggested.

4607,0.005,5.0,"Maternal samples were assessed from 96 women enrolled in Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 076 to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genotypic zidovudine resistance at entry, if zidovudine resistance developed on study, and the role of zidovudine resistance in vertical transmission of HIV-1 despite zidovudine therapy. Low and high levels of genotypic resistance were assessed by differential hybridization, oligoligation, or direct sequencing of plasma HIV-1 RNA for codons K70R and T215Y/F. None of the women had high-level genotypic resistance to zidovudine at study entry or delivery. For low-level zidovudine resistance, the 95% confidence intervals were 0.3%-6.8% for baseline prevalence and 0.3%-14% for delivery incidence. Low-level zidovudine resistance, adjusted for plasma viral RNA level at delivery, was not strongly associated with an increase in vertical transmission risk (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-131; P = .35)."
4664,0.005,5.0,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has become a major global public health problem with rising number of cases and associated deaths. Most of the present activities in developing countries, especially in Africa, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Care for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is essential not only to mitigate the impacts of HIV/AIDS among PLWHA but is also an important component of prevention of the disease. There is now a general recognition that comprehensive care across the continuum should be provided to PLWHA through all the stages of infection, with a crucial role for community-home based care activities. In addition, AIDS orphans need to be supported Although, documented evidences abound on the utility of comprehensive care and community-home based care approaches outside Africa and in some African countries, there is little information on them in Nigeria. This paper therefore reviews the recent epidemiology of HIV infection, the many currently developed initiatives to deliver comprehensive care for PLWHA in the hospital, community and at home, and the issue of AIDS orphans. In addition, measures to effectively integrate them into the mainstream of societal activities are discussed."
6076,0.005,5.0,"The transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was studied in 647 subjects who presented no apparent risk factors for the infection other than having had promiscuous heterosexual relations, heterosexual relations with people with an elevated risk of infection, or heterosexual relations with people infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Thirty subjects were found to be seropositive for anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. The elevated risk factors included being the habitual partner of a person at risk of infection or of a person who was infected by human immunodeficiency virus, or being the partner of a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The transmission of the virus was verified in 13 of 284 subjects (4.57%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons at risk and in 16 of 101 subjects (15.84%) who had had heterosexual intercourse three or more times with persons who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. No significant correlation between human immunodeficiency virus infection and a history of sexually transmitted infections, nor between human immunodeficiency virus infection and female subjects was found. These data suggest that the epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can also spread through heterosexual relations, even if the possibility of becoming infected in this way seems at the moment limited to particular risk behaviors."
1546,0.005,5.0,"Genomic rearrangements in the 5' part of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) have been involved in multidrug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI). We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study to investigate the prevalence, variability, and phenotypic consequences of such rearrangements. Data concerning the HIV-1 RT genotype and the biological and clinical characteristics of NRTI-treated patients were collected from 10 virology laboratories. Sensitivities of the different HIV-1 variants to RT inhibitors were analyzed in a single-cycle recombinant virus assay. Fifty-two of 2,152 (2.4%) RT sequences had a rearrangement in the 5' part of the RT, with an extensive molecular variation. The number of codons inserted between positions 68 and 69 ranged from 1 (3 samples) or 2 (41 samples) to 5 and 11 in one case each. In four cases, codon 67 was deleted. High levels of phenotypic resistance to zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), abacavir (ABC), and didanosine (ddI) were found in 95, 92, 72, 62, and 15% of the 40 samples analyzed, respectively. Resistance to AZT, d4T, and ABC could be found in the absence of the T215Y/F mutations. Resistance to 3TC could develop in the absence of specific mutations. Low-level resistance to ddI was noticed in 40% of the patients. The deletions of codon 67 seemed to have little effect on NRTI sensitivity. Most of the rearrangements were shown to contribute to cross-resistance to NRTI. The results regarding susceptibility to ddI raise the question of the interpretation of the phenotypic data concerning this drug."
5222,0.005,5.0,"There are limited data on the efficacy of T cell-based assays to detect tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific responses in immune-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in patients with HIV-1 infection, especially in those with advanced disease (CD4 T cell count < 300 cells/microl). An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, which detects interferon (IFN)-gamma secreted by T cells exposed to TB antigens, was used to assess specific immune responses in a prospective study of 201 HIV-1-infected patients with risk factors for TB infection, attending a single HIV unit. The performance of the ELISPOT assay to detect TB antigen-specific immune responses is independent of CD4 T cell counts in HIV-1 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis does not differ significantly from values obtained in immunocompetent subjects. The negative predictive value of the TB ELISPOT test is 98.2%. A positive predictive value of 86% for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis was found when the combined number of early secretory antigen target-6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein-10 (CFP-10) IFN-gamma spots to CD4 T cell count ratio was > 1.5. TB antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in HIV patients with low CD4 T cell counts using ELISPOT technology in a routine diagnostic laboratory and is a useful test to exclude TB infection in immune-deficient HIV-1 patients. A combination of TB antigen-specific IFN-gamma responses and CD4 T cell counts has the potential to distinguish active tuberculosis from latent infection."
8720,0.005,5.0,"One hundred thirty-four homosexual men from a prospective cohort study of AIDS risk from New York City and Washington D.C. and 139 homosexual men from a similar cohort in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark were questioned regarding their sexual practices and knowledge of their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status over the previous 12 months. Seventy percent of Danish men and 63% of U.S. men participated in anal intercourse during the previous 12 months. Knowledge of one's own HIV status by itself did not have any significant effect on participation in anal intercourse, partner number, or condom use. Only 23% of U.S. men and 24% of Danish men always asked potential partners about their HIV status. However, men who did ask were very unlikely to choose a partner of opposite HIV status (p less than 0.006). Danish men were more likely to practice anal intercourse without a condom than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.0001); however, Danes were more likely to be in a concordant monogamous relationship than were the U.S. men (p less than 0.001). Fourteen percent of U.S. men and 21% of Danish men were not aware of their own HIV status and 52% of the U.S. cohort and 31% of the Danes had anal intercourse with a man whose status was unknown to them. Overall, only 32% of American and 53% of Danish homosexual men were practicing completely safe sex. We suggest that education to promote the need for awareness of one's own and one's partner's HIV status should be stressed."

5574,0.005,5.0,"Eighteen transfusion recipients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were followed prospectively with their 19 long-term sexual partners from 1986 to 1993 in California, Florida, and New York. Follow-up included clinical, behavioral, immunologic, serologic, and virologic evaluations. Two partners were already infected when seen 18 and 34 months after sexual contact began following the infectious transfusion. Four of 17 initially seronegative partners seroconverted during 23 person-years of observation. The recipient's clinical status, mononuclear cell subset variations, and time trend in CD4+ counts had no association with transmission. Individual plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) loads were stable during observation, and sexual transmission was not attributable to an upward trend or transient burst in viremia. However, recipients who transmitted HIV-1 to their sexual partners had higher mean viral RNA levels than did nontransmitting recipients (4.3 vs. 3.6 log10 copies/ml; p = 0.05). Although this series was small, the prospective observations suggest that viral load was the only characteristic in the recipient that contributed to heterosexual infectiousness."

We prospectively assessed 25(OH)D deficiency/insufficiency in a cohort of 352 HIV patients during 2009-2010. Predisposing factors were recorded and their relationship to low levels was assessed by logistic regression; a nutritional survey examined intake, nutritional status, and sunlight exposure in a subgroup of 92 patients. We studied the correlation of 25(OH)D with parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/ml) was 44.0% (95% CI, 38.8-49.4%) and insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) was 71.6% (95% CI, 66.9-76.3). Deficiency was 16.4% more prevalent in our sample than in non-HIV-infected Spaniards. Lower sunlight exposure was the only factor related to lower levels in the lifestyle and nutritional survey (p=0.045). In multiple logistic regression, higher body mass index (BMI), black race/ethnicity, lower seasonal sunlight exposure, men who have sex with men (MSM), and heterosexual transmission categories, efavirenz exposure and lack of HIV viral suppression were independently associated with deficiency/insufficiency. These variables predicted 79% of cases [AUC=0.872 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91)]. Patients receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) [OR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.3-12.3); p=0.014] or NNRTI [OR 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-11.2); p=0.025] had higher odds of increased PTH levels; this was significant only in 25(OH)D-deficient patients (p=0.004). As in less insolated areas, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency was high in HIV-infected patients in Spain; among treated patients, levels were higher with PIs than with efavirenz."
9900,0.005,5.0,"Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) always occurs in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of severe acute HDV infection superimposed on a previously unrecognized HBV infection, in which an interferon-sparing antiviral therapy consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine was initiated and subsequently maintained. Evidence of successful suppression of HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was obtained after 65 weeks of TDF-based treatment. This was mirrored by a significant reduction in the levels of HBV DNA and HBV surface antigen. HDV RNA subsequently rebounded after our patient stopped antiviral therapy of his own accord. Interferon-sparing TDF-based antiviral therapy was safe and effective in achieving HDV RNA suppression in acute HDV superinfection. Further research into the utility of interferon-sparing TDF-based regimes in the treatment of acute HDV infection is needed."
3846,0.005,5.0,"Compromised oral health holds significant implications for the general health of medically vulnerable, HIV infected individuals. Past studies have reported that these individuals frequently suffer from oral opportunistic infections and have a tendency to develop severe periodontal disease. This study extends past research by examining the prevalence of oral infections according to patient characteristics and by reporting, for the first time, the level of perceived dental need in a large, multi-site sample of individuals with symptomatic HIV disease. Data for this study come from a survey of 857 clients of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program in 9 U.S. cities. More respondents (52%) reported a need for dental care than for any other service need. Multivariate analysis showed that clients who were white, in low-income groups, used intravenous drugs, or had a past history of oral opportunistic infections were more likely to report dental need. Relations between age, gender, insurance status, or disease status and perceived need were statistically nonsignificant. Forty-seven percent of the clients reported they had an oral opportunistic infection, the second outcome variable examined in this study. Statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) were found in the prevalence of oral opportunistic infections among race and disease severity groups. Whites and the more severely ill were more likely to report an infection than their respective counterparts."
6451,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the dynamics of the K103N mutation following the withdrawal of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), we selected the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients with the mutation at the time or after the failure of an NNRTI-containing regimen from an observational database. Of 62 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 39 continued antiretroviral treatment without NNRTIs (group A), whereas 23 discontinued all antiretrovirals after NNRTI failure (group B). A total of 149 tests were analysed, with a median (IQR) of two (2-3) tests/patient. The overgrowth of wild-type virus at position 103 was observed in 14 subjects in group A (36%) and nine in group B (39%). No significant trend was found in relation to the disappearance of K103N variants in either group, but patients tested while receiving antiretrovirals had a significantly higher probability of retaining the K103N mutation over 24 months than those tested during treatment interruption (P = 0.007). In conclusion, following NNRTI discontinuation, HIV variants carrying the K103N mutation are not overgrown for long by wild-type quasispecies at this position in the majority of patients, although treatment interruption favours their disappearance. This suggests that the K103N mutation per se has little impact on viral fitness in vivo."
4899,0.005,5.0,"To investigate the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution in vivo, a total of 179 HIV-1 V3 sequences derived from cell-free plasma were determined from serial samples in three epidemiologically linked individuals (one infected blood donor and two transfusion recipients) over a maximum period of 8 years. A systematic analysis of pairwise comparisons of intrapatient sequences, both within and between each sample time point, revealed a preponderance and accumulation of nonsynonymous rather than synonymous substitutions in the V3 loop and flanking regions as they diverged over time. This strongly argues for the dominant role that positive selection for amino acid change plays in governing the pattern and process of HIV-1 env V3 evolution in vivo and nullifies hypotheses of purely neutral or mutation-driven evolution or completely chance events. In addition, different rates of evolution of HIV-1 were observed in these three different individuals infected with the same viral strain, suggesting that the degree of positive pressure for HIV-1 amino acid change is host dependent. Finally, the observed similar rate of accumulation in divergence within and between infected individuals suggests that the process of genetic divergence in the HIV epidemic proceeds regardless of host-to-host transmission events, i.e., that transmission does not reset the evolutionary clock."
8266,0.005,5.0,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome measure among HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), but has not been studied extensively in resource-limited settings. Insight in the predictors or correlates of poor HRQoL may be helpful to identify patients most in need of additional support and to design appropriate interventions. A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2012 and April 2013 in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Patients who were at least 6 months on cART were randomly selected and individual patient data were retrieved from medical records. HRQoL was measured by the WHOQoL-HIVBREF, depressive-symptoms by the Kessler-6 scale, and stigma by the Kalichman internalized AIDS-related stigma scale. Multivariate linear regression analysis was carried-out to examine associations between HRQoL and the other variables. A total of 664 patients (response-rate 95%) participated in the study. A higher level of depressive-symptoms was most strongly and consistently associated with a lower HRQoL, both in terms of the magnitude of the relationship and in the number of HRQoL domains associated with it. Also, a higher level of HIV-stigma was associated with a lower HRQoL except for the physical domain, while obtaining sufficient nutritious food and job opportunity were associated with a better HRQoL except for the spiritual and social domains, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and treatment characteristics yielded few significant associations with HRQoL. Our study findings suggest that interventions to improve HRQoL should focus on reducing depressive-symptoms and HIV-stigma, and on enhancing food security and job opportunity. "
3662,0.005,5.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can suppress HIV-1 replication and normalize the chronic immune activation associated with infection, but restoration of naïve CD4+ T cell populations is slow and usually incomplete for reasons that have yet to be determined. We tested the hypothesis that damage to the lymphoid tissue (LT) fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) network contributes to naïve T cell loss in HIV-1 infection by restricting access to critical factors required for T cell survival. We show that collagen deposition and progressive loss of the FRC network in LTs prior to treatment restrict both access to and a major source of the survival factor interleukin-7 (IL-7). As a consequence, apoptosis within naïve T cell populations increases significantly, resulting in progressive depletion of both naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. We further show that the extent of loss of the FRC network and collagen deposition predict the extent of restoration of the naïve T cell population after 6 month of HAART, and that restoration of FRC networks correlates with the stage of disease at which the therapy is initiated. Because restoration of the FRC network and reconstitution of naïve T cell populations are only optimal when therapy is initiated in the early/acute stage of infection, our findings strongly suggest that HAART should be initiated as soon as possible. Moreover, our findings also point to the potential use of adjunctive anti-fibrotic therapies to avert or moderate the pathological consequences of LT fibrosis, thereby improving immune reconstitution."

3257,0.005,5.0,"Numerous host and viral factors likely participate in the onset and progression of HIV-1-associated dementia (HIVD). Previous studies have suggested that viral gene expression in resident central nervous system (CNS) cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage play a central role in the production of neurotoxic viral proteins and infectious virus, deregulation of cellular gene expression, and/or dysfunction of glial and neuronal cell populations. HIV-1 replication is regulated, in part, by interactions between cellular transcription factors and the viral trans-activators, Tat and viral protein R (Vpr), with cis-acting promoter elements within the LTR. We have previously demonstrated that Vpr binds with high affinity to selected sequence configurations within CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) site I and downstream sequences immediately adjacent to this site. Studies reported herein establish a correlation between the diagnosis of HIVD and the increased prevalence of HIV-1 LTRs containing a C/EBP binding site I that exhibits high affinity for Vpr. To this end, the interaction of Vpr with C/EBP site I variants in 47 LTRs from three nondemented patients and 96 LTRs from seven demented patients was examined. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses were utilized to examine Vpr binding to oligonucleotide probes containing C/EBP site I variants. We demonstrated that 89% of LTRs derived from patients exhibiting clinical dementia contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while only 11% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. In contrast, examination of LTRs derived from patients lacking clinically evident dementia revealed that only 53% of brain-derived LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that displayed a high relative affinity for Vpr, while 47% of LTRs contained C/EBP site I configurations that exhibited a low relative affinity Vpr binding phenotype. We propose that sequence-specific interactions between cis-acting elements in the LTR, members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, and the virion-associated trans-activator protein Vpr play important roles in the pathogenesis of HIVD."
5502,0.005,5.0,"The contribution of bipolar disorder (BD), a prevalent serious mental illness characterized by impulsivity and mood instability, to antiretroviral (ART) and psychiatric medication adherence among HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals is unknown. We examined medication adherence among 44 HIV+/BD+ persons as compared to 33 demographically- and medically-comparable HIV+/BD- persons. Classification of adherent (≥ 90%) or non-adherent (<90%) based on proportion of correctly taken doses over 30 days was determined using electronic medication monitoring devices. HIV+/BD+ persons were significantly less likely to be ART adherent (47.7%) as compared to HIV+/BD- (90.9%) persons. Within the HIV+/BD+ group, mean psychiatric medication adherence was significantly worse than ART medication adherence, although there was a significant correlation between ART and psychiatric adherence levels. Importantly, 30-day ART adherence was associated with plasma virologic response among HIV+/BD+ individuals. Given the high overlap of HIV and BD, and the observed medication adherence difficulties for these persons, specialized adherence improvement interventions are needed."
4390,0.005,5.0,"Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are common complications of advanced immunodeficiency in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Neurological disease is the first manifestation of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 10% to 20% of symptomatic HIV-1 infection. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of such disorders is critical. Also, in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), these disease states have changed in presentation and epidemiology. Therefore, we review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of five common central nervous system disorders in individuals with HIV-1 infection: toxoplasma encephalitis, primary central nervous system lymphoma, cryptococcal meningitis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."
694,0.005,5.0,"HIV-1 infection is characterized by loss of CD4T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in suppression of the viral load and increased CD4 counts. Both viral and host factors determine CD4 cell responses to ART with approximately 15-30% of individuals having suboptimal increase of CD4T cell count, most commonly due to lack of compliance to ART. A smaller fraction of patients will have immune reconstitution failure and suboptimal CD4 increase despite suppression of HIV replication, and these individuals are at risk for adverse health outcomes. We sought to characterize the factors associated with decreased immunological response among Manitoba's HIV patient population. This retrospective case-control study included HIV patients with immune reconstitution failure despite suppression of HIV replication by ART. The immune reconstitution failure was defined by CD4 cell count increase from baseline of less than 100 CD4 cells/mm"
2034,0.005,5.0,"Due to their shared transmission route, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infections can be observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected cases and are associated with more severe clinical courses. The detection of HBV DNA despite HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) seronegativity is defined as occult HBV infections. According to the current seroepidemiological data, Turkey is classified as an intermediate HBV, low HIV endemic region. Occult HBV infections have previously been reported from Turkey but has not been investigated previously in HIV infected cohorts. The aim of this study was to identify occult HBV infections in HIV-infected persons. Twenty-eight HIV-positive cases followed-up at Hacettepe University Hospital, Infectious Diseases Unit were included in the study after informed consent. For the detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HCV, commercial ELISA tests (Architect System, Abbott Diagnostics, USA) were employed. Absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were determined via flow cytometry. HIV viral load was calculated via COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA) and the presence of HBV DNA was evaluated via COBAS TaqMan HBV Real-time PCR (Roche Diagnostics, USA), in addition to a nested PCR assay targeting HBV S gene. The mean age of the study group was 43.2 (range between 27-65) years, 64.3% (18/28) of them were males and the mean duration of HIV infection was 4.2 (2-11) years. Mean CD4+ ve CD8+ T-cell counts were 414 ± 267 cells/mm3 and 854 ± 293 cells/mm3, respectively. Twenty-six (92.8%) cases were under highly-active anti-retroviral therapy at the time of the study, 88.5% of which included HBV-active drugs (lamivudine or tenofovir). HIV RNA were found negative in 11 (39.3%) patients, of those nine (81.8%) were the cases who treated with HBV-active antiretroviral therapy. HBsAg were negative in all of the 28 patients, while the positivity rates of anti-HBs and anti-HCV were 39.3% (11/28) and 3.6% (1/28), respectively. All samples were negative for HBV DNA via the commercial real-time PCR and in-house nested PCR assays. The absence of occult HBV in the study group may indicate the absence of occult HBV or suppression of viral replication due to the anti-retroviral therapy. In conclusion, further large-scale studies are required to fully understand the impact of occult HBV in HIV-infected patients in Turkey."

HBV DNA was particularly frequent in HIV-positive patients. Sequencing of the S gene showed that only two HIV-infected patients harboured mutants in the major hydrophilic loop; the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen detection could not be explained by diagnostic escape mutants.
4996,0.005,5.0,"Depression is associated with poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. This relationship may be moderated by an individual's social network characteristics. Our study sought to examine social network correlates of treatment adherence among HIV-positive men recruited from social service agencies throughout Los Angeles County (N = 150) to inform technology-driven social support interventions for this population. We administered egocentric social network and computer-assisted survey interviews focused on demographic characteristics, health history, depressive symptoms, and ART adherence, where adherence was assessed by the number of reasons participants missed taking their medication, if ever. Significant univariate correlates of adherence were included in a multivariable regression analysis, where the moderating effect of having a network member who reminds participants to take their HIV medication on the relationship between depression and adherence was tested. Over 60% of participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms; this was significantly associated with lower adherence among those without someone in their social network to remind them about taking their HIV medication, even after adjusting for covariates in an ordinary least squares regression (adjusted mean difference b = -1.61, SE = 0.42, p = 0.0003). Having a network member who reminds participants to take their ART medication significantly ameliorated the negative association between depression and treatment adherence, especially for those reporting greater depressive symptoms (p = 0.0394). Additionally, participants demonstrated high rates of technology use to communicate with social network members. In order to achieve the aims of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, innovative interventions addressing mental health to improve ART adherence are needed. Network strategies that leverage technology may be helpful for improving ART adherence among HIV-positive men with comorbid depressive symptoms."
6532,0.005,5.0,"This study describes the social networks of secondary school students in Moshi Municipality, and their association with self-rated risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among 300 students aged 15-24 years in 5 secondary schools in Moshi, Tanzania. Bonding networks were defined as social groupings of students participating in activities within the school, while bridging networks were groups that included students participating in social groupings from outside of the school environs. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about participation in bonding and bridging social networks and self-rated HIV risk behavior. More participants participated in bonding networks (72%) than in bridging networks (29%). Participation in bridging networks was greater among females (25%) than males (12%, p<.005). Of 300 participants, 88 (29%) were sexually experienced, and of these 62 (70%) considered themselves to be at low risk of HIV infection. Factors associated with self-rated risk of HIV included: type of school (p<.003), family structure (p<.008), being sexually experienced (p<.004), having had sex in the past three months (p<.009), having an extra sexual partner (p<.054) and non-condom use in last sexual intercourse (p<.001), but not the presence or type of social capital. The study found no association between bonding and bridging social networks on self-rated risk of HIV among study participants. However, sexually experienced participants rated themselves at low risk of HIV infection despite practicing unsafe sex. Efforts to raise adolescents' self-awareness of risk of HIV infection through life skills education and HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome risk reduction strategies may be beneficial to students in this at-risk group."
5606,0.005,5.0,"Molecular clones of HIV-1 were obtained from isolates cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and directly from uncultured PBMCs from a laboratory worker accidentally infected with the HIV-1 laboratory strain, HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB). Envelope sequences corresponding to the first 752 amino acids of HIV-1(HTLV-IIIB) clone BH10 were obtained from clones of cultured virus and sequenced. Three env clones obtained shortly after infection differed among themselves at only seven nucleotide positions, resulting in one amino acid substitution and one frameshift mutation. These envelope sequences were as similar to the envelope sequences of various IIIB clones as the latter were to each other. env divergence increased over the course of infection. However, the overall diversity in env clones obtained two or more years after infection was still comparable to that among IIIB env clones from the original IIIB culture. Multiple clones of partial env gene sequences containing the V3 loop were also obtained directly from uncultured PBMCs by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The env sequences of these clones were generally similar to those of the cultured viruses. Within the V3 region, the earliest isolates retained the sequence of the HXB2 clone from IIIB. Clones obtained later showed a progressive divergence in V3. An A-to-T substitution within the GPGRAF sequence at the tip of the V3 loop was observed within 1 year after infection, and this mutation predominated in all subsequent isolates. Antibodies against the V3 loops of IIIB and divergent 1987 and 1990 LW isolates appeared simultaneously in laboratory worker serum and persisted with no significant differences in titer. Furthermore, neutralization studies with autologous sequential sera suggested selection for the A-to-T change in V3 was not due to V3-directed antibodies. These results demonstrate a surprising homogeneity among env sequences of HIV-1 from an infected laboratory worker, perhaps because the initial infection originated from a relatively homogeneous population of tissue culture-adapted virus."
8801,0.005,5.0,"The host genetic compound plays a vital role in determining clinical outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activator (TANK) takes part in the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway and the interferon (IFN)-induction pathways that have relevance to HBV-related liver disease. In this report, we explored whether the intronic polymorphism rs3820998 of the TANK gene was associated with outcomes of HBV infection by binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 1305 unrelated Han Chinese patients recruited from Wuhan, including 180 acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACLF-HBV) patients, 331 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, 308 HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, and 486 asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC) were genotyped using the TaqMan probe method. Logistic analysis revealed that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3820998 was significantly associated with susceptibility to ACLF-HBV (dominant model, OR 0.643, 95% CI 0.428,0.964, p=0.033; additive model, OR 0.640, 95% CI 0.414,0.990, p=0.045), and LC (recessive model, OR 0.398, 95% CI 0.164,0.966, p=0.042; additive model, OR 0.379, 95% CI 0.155,0.928, p=0.034). These results indicate that the G > T variant is a protective factor in the development of ACLF-HBV and LC, and that the SNP rs3820998 in the TANK gene may play a role in mediating susceptibility to ACLF-HBV and LC in a Chinese Han population."
2498,0.005,5.0,"The spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has gradually decreased in Italy in the last 5 decades as shown by the steady reduction in the incidence rates of acute hepatitis B, from 10/100000 inhabitants in 1984 to 0.85/100000 in 2012, and by the reduced prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive cases among chronic hepatitis patients with different etiologies, from 60% in 1975 to about 10% in 2001. The prevalence of HBsAg chronic carriers in the general population also decreased from nearly 3% in the 1980s to 1% in 2010. Linked to HBV by its characteristics of defective virus, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has shown a similar epidemiological impact on the Italian population over time. The incidence of acute HDV infection decreased from 3.2/100000 inhabitants in 1987 to 0.8/100000 in 2010 and the prevalence of HDV infection in HBsAg chronic carriers decreased from 24% in 1990 to 8.5% in 2006. Before the beneficial effects of HBV mass vaccination introduced in 1991, the decreased endemicity of HBV and HDV infection in Italy paralleled the improvement in screening blood donations, the higher standard of living and impressive reduction in the birth rate associated with a marked reduction in the family size. A further contribution to the decline in HBV and HDV infections most probably came from the media campaigns to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus infection by focusing the attention of the general population on the same routes of transmission of viral infections such as unsafe sexual intercourse and parenteral exposures of different kinds.

3494,0.005,5.0,"During the period May 1987 to November 1989, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers was determined by ELISA in serum samples of 7405 (55% male, 45% female) apparently healthy persons 3-19 years of age in Italy. Earlier studies of adults there had shown an intermediate degree of HBV endemicity (hepatitis B surface antigen carrier rate greater than 2%). Persons were selected by systematic cluster sampling in five different geographical areas of Italy. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was 0.6%. The overall prevalence of at least one marker of HBV was 2.8%; it increased from 1.7% among children 3-5 years of age to 4.5% in teenagers 17-19 years of age (P less than 0.001). The prevalence of any HBV marker was higher in southern then in northern areas (3.5% vs. 1.8%, P less than 0.001). A significant association was found with sociodemographic features. Persons whose fathers had less than 6 years of schooling had a 2.3-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.5-3.4) while those belonging to a household of six or more under one roof had a 1.7-fold risk (C.I. 95% = 1.2-2.4) of previous exposure to HBV infection. These findings indicate that, today in Italy, exposure to HBV infection at a young age is very low and suggest a shift towards a low degree of endemicity following improvements in socio-economic conditions, decreased family size and increasing use of disposable syringes during recent years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9196,0.005,5.0,"Because of the increasing availability of antiretroviral (ARV) agents for HIV in low-income countries, many clinicians now need training on their use. This is especially true for clinicians caring for individuals with tuberculosis (TB), given its close relationship with HIV/AIDS. This article summarizes the key decisions facing clinicians who manage HIV-infected persons, with particular reference to issues regarding those dually infected with TB. Health care provider-initiated diagnostic testing using rapid HIV tests should be offered to all individuals with symptoms and signs suggesting HIV infection, including all persons with TB. Issues to be included in pre- and post-test counseling sessions are discussed. HIV-infected patients should be evaluated to determine clinical staging of HIV; certain laboratory examinations should ideally be performed to assess the degree of immunosuppression and to aid decisions about when best to start ARV therapy and preventive therapies. The recommended ARV regimens and guidance on proposed patient follow-up are presented. Good adherence to ARVs is required and factors that induce and reinforce compliance are suggested. The treatment of TB is a high priority, and follows the same principles whether the patient is HIV-infected or not. Suggestions are made about ARV use in patients with TB. A standardized and complementary information system should be developed to monitor management of HIV-TB patients and performance of joint TB and HIV care efforts. By diagnosing and managing additional HIV cases detected through the portal of the TB control programme, clinicians will contribute to diminishing the burden of HIV, and thus, TB."

There are conflicting data on the effect of HCV on the risk of HIV progression and CD4 response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Long-term prospective cohort studies are clearly required to resolve these issues. The optimal management of the co-infected patient is also unclear. For the co-infected patient, the optimal HAART regimen for best immune CD4 recovery and least adverse reactions remains unclear. Unfortunately, current HCV treatment is associated with significant side effects and a considerable proportion of HIV co-infected patients are poor candidates for HCV treatment. Better and more effective treatment for HCV (preferably not based on interferon) is urgently required for this group of patients. Patients with good CD4 cell count and with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 are likely to have a reasonable response to treatment."

2578,0.005,5.0,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis prompted the reintroduction of para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) to protect companion anti-tuberculosis drugs from additional acquired resistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, MDR/XDR tuberculosis with HIV coinfection is common, and concurrent treatment of HIV infection and MDR/XDR tuberculosis is required. Out of necessity, patients receive multiple drugs, and PAS therapy is frequent; however, neither potential drug interactions nor the effects of HIV infection are known. Potential drug-drug interaction with PAS and the effect of HIV infection was examined in 73 pulmonary tuberculosis patients; 22 (30.1%) were HIV coinfected. Forty-one pulmonary MDR or XDR tuberculosis patients received 4 g PAS twice daily, and in a second crossover study, another 32 patients were randomized, receiving 4 g PAS twice daily or 8 g PAS once daily. A PAS population pharmacokinetic model in two dosing regimens was developed; potential covariates affecting its pharmacokinetics were examined, and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted evaluating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic index. The probability of target attainment (PTA) to maintain PAS levels above MIC during the dosing interval was estimated by simulation of once-, twice-, and thrice-daily dosing regimens not exceeding 12 g daily. Concurrent efavirenz (EFV) medication resulted in a 52% increase in PAS clearance and a corresponding >30% reduction in mean PAS area under the concentration curve in 19 of 22 HIV-M. tuberculosis-coinfected patients. Current practice recommends maintenance of PAS concentrations at ≥1 μg/ml (the MIC of M. tuberculosis), but the model predicts that at only a minimum dose of 4 g twice daily can this PTA be achieved in at least 90% of the population, whether or not EFV is concomitantly administered. Once-daily dosing of 12 g PAS will not provide PAS concentrations exceeding the MIC over the entire dosing interval if coadministered with EFV, while 4 g twice daily ensures concentrations exceeding MIC over the entire dosing interval, even in HIV-infected patients who received EFV.

1303,0.005,5.0,"Health literacy is known to influence medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. People who experience difficulty reading health information may benefit from asking others to assist them with reading, interpreting, and understanding medical information. We examined medical chart-abstracted HIV viral load, medication adherence assessed by unannounced pill counts, and adherence improvement strategies among 245 individuals with lower-health literacy who do not request assistance, and 229 who do request assistance with reading and understanding health information. Participants were people living with HIV who were taking antiretroviral therapy and scored below 90% correct on a standardized test of functional health literacy. After controlling for health literacy scores, requesting informational assistance was associated with strategies used to improve adherence; individuals who asked for assistance were significantly more likely to use multiple adherence strategies. However, despite requesting informational assistance and using more adherence strategies, participants who requested informational assistance evidenced poorer treatment adherence and poorer suppression of HIV replication. Requesting assistance was more common among those with the poorest health literacy and therefore greatest challenges to adherence. People living with HIV who have poor health literacy skills may benefit from medication adherence programs and requests for assistance afford opportunities for social interventions."

Causes (including HIV symptoms, quality of life, depression, herbal treatment and alcohol use) for discontinuing ART follow-up in predominantly rural resource-limited settings are not well understood. This is a prospective study of the treatment-naïve patients recruited from three (one urban, one-semi-urban and one rural) public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal from October 2007 to February 2008. The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of loss to follow-up or all caused attrition from an ART programme within a cohort followed up for over 12 months. A total of 735 patients (217 men and 518 women) prior to initiating ART completed a baseline questionnaire and 6- and 12-months' follow-up. At 12-months follow-up 557 (75.9%) individuals continued active ART, 177 (24.1%) were all cause attrition, there were 82 deaths (13.8%), 58 (7.9%) transfers, 7 (1.0%) refused participation, 8 (1.1%) were not yet on ART and 22 (3.0%) could not be traced. Death by 12-months of follow-up was associated with lower CD4 cell counts (risk ratio, RR=2.05, confidence intervals, CI=1.20-3.49) and higher depression levels (RR=1.05, CI=1.01-1.09) at baseline assessment. The high early mortality rates indicate that patients are enrolling into ART programmes with far too advanced immunodeficiency; median CD4 cell counts 119 (IQR=59-163). Causes of late access to the ART programme, such as delays in health care access (delayed health care seeking), health system delays, or inappropriate treatment criteria, need to be addressed. Differences in health status (lower CD4 cell counts and higher depression scores) should be taken into account when initiating patients on ART. Treating depression at ART initiation is recommended to improve treatment outcome."

Two groups were evaluated: those who had achieved HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA <500 copies/mL, group 1, n=21) and those who had achieved incomplete HIV-RNA suppression (HIV-RNA>500 copies/mL, group 2, n=14) at the time of study entry. NFV one-hour pre-dose concentrations were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (P=0.023). The NFV AUC(0.5-4) for group 1 approached significance (P=0.068). No significant differences in IDV concentrations or AUC(0.5-4) were found between group 1 and group 2. It is feasible to use PI drug level monitoring in the outpatient setting."

Through ethnographic research in São Paulo from 1999 to 2001, the life trajectories of 50 children ages 1-15 living with or affected by HIV were studied. Data were collected via participant observation and semi-structured informal interviews and analyzed using social theories on illness experience and social inequality. Our results demonstrate that AIDS-related stigma occurs within complex discrimination processes that change as children reach adolescence. We found that structural violence in the forms of poverty, racism, and inequalities in social status, gender, and age fuels children's experiences of stigma. We also describe how access to HAART changes the lived experience of children, reduces stigma, and brings new challenges in AIDS care such as adolescents' sexuality and treatment adherence. Based on these results, we propose structural violence as the framework to study stigma and argue that interventions to reduce stigma that solely target the perception and attitudes toward people living with HIV are limited. In contrast universal access to HAART in Brazil is a powerful intervention that reduces stigma, in that it transforms AIDS from a debilitating and fatal disease to a chronic and manageable one, belongs to a broader mechanism to assure citizens' rights, and reduces social inequalities in access to health care."

Peripheral blood iNKT cells from HIV-1+ and TB patients had significantly increased expression of CD69, CD38, HLA-DR, CD16, CD56, and CD62L. The expression of CD25 was significantly increased only on iNKT cells from TB patients.

9509,0.005,5.0,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent trans-activator of transcription from the viral LTR promoter. Previous mutagenesis studies have identified domains within Tat responsible for binding to its TAR RNA target and for transcriptional activation. The minimal Tat activation domain is composed of the N-terminal 48 residues, and mutational analyses identified a cluster of critical cysteines. The importance of four highly conserved aromatic amino acids within the activation domain has not been thoroughly investigated. We have systematically substituted these aromatic residues (Y26, F32, F38, Y47) of the HIV-1 LAI Tat protein with other aromatic residues (conservative mutation) or alanine (nonconservative mutation). The activity of the mutant Tat constructs was measured in different cell lines by transfection with a LTR-CAT reporter plasmid. The range of transcriptional activities measured for this set of Tat mutants allowed careful assessment of the level of Tat activity required for optimal viral replication. To test this, the mutant Tat genes were introduced into the pLAI infectious molecular clone and tested for their effect on virus replication in a T-cell line. We found that a twofold reduction in Tat activity already affects viral replication, and no virus replication was measured for Tat mutants with less than 15% activity. This strict correlation between Tat activity and viral replication demonstrates the importance of the Tat function to viral fitness. Interestingly, a less pronounced replication defect was observed in primary cell types. This finding may correlate with the frequent detection of proviruses with Tat-inactivating mutations in clinical samples."

We assessed whether carriage of the TNF-α gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with lipodystrophy and metabolic derangements in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. We also assessed variations in TNF-α receptor plasma levels. The study group comprised 286 HIV-1-infected patients (133 with and 153 without lipodystrophy) and 203 uninfected controls (UC). TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863 C > A SNP were assessed using PCR-RFLPs on white cell DNA. Plasma sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were measured by ELISA. Student's t test, the χ(2) test, Pearson correlations, and the logistic regression test were performed for statistical analysis. The TNF-α -308G > A SNP was significantly associated with lipodystrophy in the univariate analysis (p = 0.04). This association, however, was no longer significant in the multivariate analysis. A meta-analysis of the published literature and our own data, which included 284 patients with lipodystrophy and 338 without lipodystrophy, showed that there was no relationship between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). HIV-1-infected patients had greater sTNF-α R2 plasma levels than UC (p = 0.001) whereas sTNF-α R1 and R2 levels were not significantly different in both the HIV-1-infected cohorts, lipodystrophy vs. nonlipodystrophy (p = NS). In our cohort of white Spaniards the TNF-α -238G > A, -308G > A, and -863C > A SNP were not associated with lipodystrophy in HIV-1-infected patients treated with cART. This finding was replicated in a meta-analysis of the published data, which showed no associations between the TNF-α -238G > A and -308G > A SNP and lipodystrophy. In HIV-1-infected patients under cART there is a systemic overproduction of sTNF-α R2, which is unrelated to the presence of lipodystrophy."
5915,0.005,5.0,"We describe preliminary molecular characterization of HIV-1 pol from 108 consecutive HIV seropositive users of a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) site of Porto Alegre city, the major metropolitan area in the south of Brazil. Protease and partial reverse transcriptase regions were retrotranscribed from plasma HIV-1 RNA and sequenced after direct nested PCR. Principal antiretroviral resistance mutations (ARM) were observed in 3% of the samples, two cases with K103N and one with M41L, L210W and T215Y, all in HIV-1 clade B infected men. At protease region, no principal mutations were observed, but polymorphisms at secondary codons were frequent. Contrary to other areas in the country where clade B dominates, HIV-1 clade C genomes predominated in this study (58%), clade B (32%) and clade F1 (3%). Of the genomes clustering in clade C, almost half (43%) had a small clade B segment at reverse transcriptase, forming a sub-cluster within clade C with a similar recombinant structure and carrying new amino acid signatures. Other mosaic genomes were also observed (7%). The low prevalence of resistance mutations is consistent with previous observations at this geographical location but the high frequency of HIV-1 clade C and CB mosaics seems pre-eminent and warns close monitoring."
1096,0.005,5.0,"U.S. AIDS rates have declined among same population groups; however, African-Americans and other ethnic minorities have experienced the least amount of decline. As a result medical and public health authorities are tasked with developing strategies to help eliminate the disparity in HIV/AIDS incidence rate and clinical outcomes. Thus, in 1999, the National Minority AIDS Education and Training Center (NMAETC) was developed to facilitate training, clinical consultation and technical assistance to clinicians that provide care to HIV-infected minority patients. Its initial activities were designed solely to increase providers' clinical capacity to use state-of-art anti-retroviral therapies to treat and manage the disease. However, through focused discussions with target providers and a survey of medical care service sites, the NMAETC confirms that provider' training and assistance needs extend into non-medical domains."
5653,0.004,4.0,"The reasons for the viral persistence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are unknown, but are probably related to host immune factors. Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can regulate an inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of MMP-3 and -9 genes on the susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. We studied 489 Korean patients with HBV infection (144 inactive carriers, 182 chronic hepatitis, and 163 liver cirrhosis) and 174 healthy individuals who had recovered from HBV infection. MMP-3 gene SNPs were identified at two polymorphic sites (codon 45 [E45K] and codon 96 [D96D]) and MMP-9 gene SNPs at three polymorphic sites (codon 279 [R279Q], codon 607 [G607G], and codon 668 [Q668R]) in study subjects. The frequency of T allele at third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene was higher in HBV persistence patients when analyzed by co-dominant model (age- and sex-adjusted OR=1.242, 95% CI= 1.001-1.540, p=0.049). In conclusion the T allele at the third position of codon 96 in the MMP-3 gene might be associated with persistent HBV infection."

991,0.004,4.0,"Both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 seroconversions have been considered as outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of needle exchange programs. To assess the relationships between incident HBV and HIV infections among injecting drug users (IDUs), seroconversions were prospectively studied among a cohort of 240 HBV- and HIV- seronegative IDUs. The incidence of HBV seroconversion declined from 24.41/100 person-years in 1988 to 0 seroconversions in 1992. In contrast, HIV seroconversion rates varied little from the overall rate of 3.29/100 person-years. HBV seroconversion predicted subsequent HIV seroconversion among male IDUs (relative incidence [RI]= 4.23) but not among female IDUs (RI=0.86). Because of different transmission dynamics, HBV seroconversion probably has limited utility as a surrogate outcome measure for incident HIV. However, HBV seroconversion itself is an appropriate and important outcome measure for evaluation of prevention programs among IDUs."
455,0.004,4.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and shows a propensity to metastasize and infiltrate adjacent and more distant tissues. HCC is associated with multiple risk factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is especially prevalent in China. Here, we used exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in ten HBV-positive individuals with HCC with portal vein tumor thromboses (PVTTs), intrahepatic metastases. Both C:G>A:T and T:A>A:T transversions were frequently found among the 331 non-silent mutations. Notably, ARID1A, which encodes a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was mutated in 14 of 110 (13%) HBV-associated HCC specimens. We used RNA interference to assess the roles of 91 of the confirmed mutated genes in cellular survival. The results suggest that seven of these genes, including VCAM1 and CDK14, may confer growth and infiltration capacity to HCC cells. This study provides a view of the landscape of somatic mutations that may be implicated in advanced HCC."
8664,0.004,4.0,"Since some hepatitis viruses and the human immunodeficiency viruses share common modes of transmission, such as the sexual route, we undertook to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to these and other pathogens among 384 rural pregnant women. Our study was intended to form the basis of infection management policies in pregnancy. Antibodies and other markers of the hepatitis A, B, C, and D viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum were sought. We tested for antibodies to the viruses using the appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. HCV and HIV-1 infection were confirmed using standard immunoblotting techniques. Regarding HBV, we tested for the surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) and antibody to the core antigen (anti-HBc). A non-specific test, the rapid plasma reagin test (RPR), was used for estimating Treponema pallidum (syphilis) infection. We found an overall prevalence of antibodies to HAV of 91.4%, to HCV of 6.8%, to HDV of 0%, and to HIV-1 of 3.5%. We found no IgM antibodies to HAV. The incidence of HBV markers was as follows: 5.4% for HBsAg, 61.3% for anti-HBs, and 84.6% for anti-HBc. RPR reactivity was found in 15.8% of the women. These results will be used to establish appropriate management and preventative policies for women attending the antenatal clinic. Prevention and appropriate early treatment of infections in these women will be considered."
5168,0.004,4.0,"The present study examined the comparative efficacy of intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient dyadic level, versus the individual caregiver level, for caregivers and their care-recipients with HIV/AIDS. Participants were randomly assigned to a Dyad Intervention (DI), a Caregiver Intervention (CI) or Wait List Control group (WLC), and assessed by interview and self-administered scales immediately before treatment and eight weeks later. Participants in the intervention groups also completed a four-month follow-up assessment. Dependent variables included global distress, social adjustment, dyadic adjustment, subjective health status, HIV/AIDS knowledge and target problem ratings. Results showed that caregivers in the DI group showed greater improvement from pre- to post-treatment on global distress, dyadic adjustment and target problems than the CI and WLC caregivers. The CI and DI caregivers showed greater improvement than the WLC group on all dependent variables except social adjustment. Care-recipients in the DI group improved significantly from pre- to post-treatment on dyadic adjustment, social adjustment, knowledge, subjective health status and Target Problem 1, whereas the CI and WLC care-recipients failed to improve on any of these measures. The treatment gains made by the DI caregivers and care-recipients on most dependent variables were maintained at a four-month follow-up. Findings support a reciprocal determinism approach to the process of dyadic adjustment and suggest that intervening at the caregiver/care-recipient level may produce better outcomes for both the caregiver and care-recipient than intervening at the individual caregiver level."
1237,0.004,4.0,"African green monkeys (AGMs) are naturally infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) at high prevalence levels and do not progress to AIDS. Sexual transmission is the main transmission route in AGM, while mother-to-infant transmission (MTIT) is negligible. We investigated SIV transmission in wild AGMs to assess whether or not high SIV prevalence is due to differences in mucosal permissivity to SIV (i.e., whether the genetic bottleneck of viral transmission reported in humans and macaques is also observed in AGMs in the wild). We tested 121 sabaeus AGMs (Chlorocebus sabaeus) from the Gambia and found that 53 were SIV infected (44%). By combining serology and viral load quantitation, we identified 4 acutely infected AGMs, in which we assessed the diversity of the quasispecies by single-genome amplification (SGA) and documented that a single virus variant established the infections. We thus show that natural SIV transmission in the wild is associated with a genetic bottleneck similar to that described for mucosal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in humans. Flow cytometry assessment of the immune cell populations did not identify major differences between infected and uninfected AGM. The expression of the SIV coreceptor CCR5 on CD4+ T cells dramatically increased in adults, being higher in infected than in uninfected infant and juvenile AGMs. Thus, the limited SIV MTIT in natural hosts appears to be due to low target cell availability in newborns and infants, which supports HIV MTIT prevention strategies aimed at limiting the target cells at mucosal sites. Combined, (i) the extremely high prevalence in sexually active AGMs, (ii) the very efficient SIV transmission in the wild, and (iii) the existence of a fraction of multiparous females that remain uninfected in spite of massive exposure to SIV identify wild AGMs as an acceptable model of exposed, uninfected individuals."
204,0.004,4.0,Clinical trials were conducted to assess the feasibility of using a cell phone text messaging-based system to follow up Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral (ARTs) and assess for improved adherence to their medication. However there is need to evaluate the perceptions of the HIV infected patients towards the use of these cell phones in an effort to better aid in the clinical management of their HIV infection. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the perceptions of HIV infected patients on the use of cell phone text messaging as a tool to support adherence to their ART medication.
3379,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral treatment nonadherence is complex, implicating more than a patient's ability and motivation to be compliant. The bulk of the research to date focuses on individual level barriers with less emphasis on the many system level factors that potentially impact patients' adherence behaviors. This study examined the effects of system enabling factors in addition to the frequently studied individual predisposing and enabling factors upon nonadherence to treatment. One hundred eighty-two patients from five community-based clinics were interviewed and their medical charts examined. Patients' self-reported nonadherence was correlated with clinicians' assessments of medication and appointment nonadherence. Seven individual predisposing factors (gender, ethnicity, birthplace, years of education, HIV Overview of Problems-Evaluation System [HOPES] psychosocial, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] anxiety, and HADS depression scores) were found to be significantly associated with treatment adherence/nonadherence. Individual enabling factors (hopefulness and access to health care), as well as treatment by clinic staff, a system enabling factor, were significantly associated with adherence/nonadherence. In a multivariate analysis, six factors - age (younger), gender (female), birth outside the United States, level of hopefulness (lower), access to health care (lower), and treatment by clinic staff (poorer) - accounted for 19.3% of the variance in nonadherence. Results of this study indicated that several individual predisposing and enabling factors were potential predictors of treatment nonadherence; however, system enabling factors, e.g., treatment by clinic staff were also associated with treatment nonadherence. Further studies are needed to examine the complex relationships of individual and system related factors in predicting treatment nonadherence."
8329,0.004,4.0,"The duration of HIV infection is usually unknown for most patients entering into HIV care. Data on the frequency at which resistance mutations are detected in these patients are needed to support practical guidance on the use of resistance testing in this clinical situation. Furthermore, little is known about HIV subtype diversity in much of the United States. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence of drug resistance mutations and nonsubtype B strains of HIV among antiretroviral-naïve individuals presenting for HIV care in New York State between September 2000 and January 2004. Sequences were obtained using a commercial HIV genotyping assay. Seventeen of 151 subjects (11.3%; 95% confidence interval 7.2%-17.3%) had at least one drug-resistance mutation, including 5 subjects with fewer than 200 CD4(+) T cells, indicative of advanced infection. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor resistance mutations were detected in 6.6%, 5.3%, and 0.7% of subjects, respectively. Subjects from New York City-based clinics were less likely to have resistant virus than subjects from clinics elsewhere in New York State. Nonsubtype B strains of HIV were detected in 9 (6.0%) individuals and were associated with heterosexual contact. Two nonsubtype B strains from this cohort also carried drug-resistance mutations. These data indicate that drug-resistant virus is frequently detected in antiretroviral-naïve individuals entering HIV care in New York State. Furthermore, a diverse set of nonsubtype B strains were identified and evidence suggests that nonsubtype B strains, including those carrying drug-resistance mutations, are being transmitted in New York State."
1457,0.004,4.0,"Measures of sexual health were assessed during 2008-2009 in a New York City sample of 102 injection and noninjection users of heroin, cocaine, or crack. There was considerable overlap and transitioning between crack smoking and injecting. Crack users were also significantly more likely to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual than other drug users. In multivariate analysis, HIV infection was independently associated with crack use and with being gay or bisexual. In New York City, HIV prevention for drug users has focused on syringe access, safe injection, and drug user treatment, but further progress in HIV control will require strategies to address sexual health among people who use drugs. The study's limitations are noted."

3610,0.004,4.0,"Recent findings suggest bidirectional antagonisms between the K65R mutation and thymidine analogue mutations in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected, treatment-experienced patients, yet little is known about HIV-2 in this regard. This study addressed the effects of innate polymorphisms in HIV-2 on emergent resistance to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues. Emergent drug resistance profiles in HIV-2 subtypes A (n = 3) and B (n = 1) were compared to those of HIV-1 subtypes B and C. Drug resistance was evaluated with cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) and MT2 cells, using selective pressure with tenofovir (TFV), zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), or various dual-drug combinations. Resistance was evaluated using conventional and ultrasensitive sequencing approaches. In agreement with our previous findings, dual-drug combinations of TFV, ddI, ABC, d4T, ZDV, and 3TC preferentially selected for K65R in HIV-1 subtype C isolates. In HIV-1 subtype B, TFV-3TC and ZDV-3TC selected for M184I and D67N, respectively. In contrast, selections with all four HIV-2 cultures favored the development of M184I in dual-drug combinations that included either 3TC or FTC. Since HIV-2 cultures did not develop K65R, an ultrasensitive allele-specific real-time PCR assay was developed to distinguish the presence of 65R from wild-type K65 after 16 cycles with a discriminatory ability of 0.1% against a population of wild-type virus. These results underscore potential differences in emergent drug resistance pathways in HIV-1 and HIV-2 and show that polymorphisms may influence the development of the resistance pathways that are likely to emerge."
7335,0.004,4.0,"We report a large monocentric case series of 82 patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). No germline mutations of the PPH1 gene (bone morphogenetic protein receptor-II) were found in any of the 19 patients tested. PAH was the direct cause of death in 72% of cases. Survival rates of the overall population at 1, 2, and 3 years were 73, 60, and 47%, respectively. Survival was significantly poorer in patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV at the time of diagnosis, as compared with those in functional class I-II with respective rates of 60, 45, and 28% versus 100, 90, 84% at 1, 2, and 3 years (p < 0.0001). Subsequently, we analyzed prognostic factors in patients in functional class III-IV. Univariate analysis indicated that CD4 lymphocyte count of more than 212 cells mm(-3), the use of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), and epoprostenol infusion were related with a better survival. On multivariate analysis only CD4 lymphocyte count was an independent predictor of survival, presumably because CART and epoprostenol infusion were strongly linked in our patient population. These results suggest that patients with severe human immunodeficiency virus-associated PAH should be considered for long-term epoprostenol infusion in association with CART."

Two HIV-1(LAI) RT regions encompassing mutation M41L, L74V, M184V, and T215Y/F were recognized in 75 and 83% mutated and in 33 and 42% unmutated samples, respectively. A total of 41 new CTL epitopes overlapping these mutations were predicted. Mutations enhanced HLA-binding scores of 17 epitopes, decreased scores of 5, and had no effect in 19. Four predicted epitopes containing mutations 41, 74, and 184 were tested and recognized by CD8 cells from mutated or unmutated samples, with frequencies up to 270 gamma interferon spot-forming cells per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Therefore, RT mutations induced by NRTI can increase the immunogenicity of RT for CTL and might allow a better immune control of resistant viruses in vivo, suggesting that specific immune therapy might help prevent these mutations."

5618,0.004,4.0,"Monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection is associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory markers and increased risk for premature development of age-related diseases. Because activated monocytes primarily use glucose to support cellular metabolism, we hypothesized that chronic monocyte activation during HIV-1 infection induces a hypermetabolic response with increased glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expression and glucose uptake by monocyte subpopulations in HIV-seropositive (HIV(+)) treatment-naive individuals (n = 17), HIV(+) individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy with viral loads below detection (n = 11), and HIV-seronegative (HIV(-)) individuals (n = 16). Surface expression of Glut1 and cellular uptake of the fluorescent glucose analog 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose were analyzed by flow cytometry on monocyte subpopulations. Irrespective of treatment status, monocytes from HIV(+) persons had significantly increased surface expression of Glut1 compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Nonclassical (CD14(+)CD16(++)) and intermediate (CD14(++)CD16(+)) monocyte subpopulations showed higher Glut1 expression than did classical (CD14(++)CD16(-)) monocytes. Intermediate monocytes from treatment-naive HIV(+) individuals also showed increased uptake of 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl) amino)-2 deoxyglucose compared with those from HIV(-) controls. Our results show that HIV infection is associated with increased glucose metabolism in monocytes and that Glut1 expression by proinflammatory monocytes is a potential marker of inflammation in HIV-infected subjects. However, the possibility exists whereby other Gluts such as Glut3 and Glut4 may also support the influx of glucose into activated and inflammatory monocyte populations. "
3760,0.004,4.0,"Liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver disease is complicated by HBV recurrence and, consequently, poor patient and graft survival. Patients transplanted for hepatitis delta virus (HDV)-related cirrhosis are reported to have a diminished incidence of HBV recurrence and improved graft survival. However, only a few reported HDV-infected patients had active HBV replicative disease before liver transplantation. In our experience, we transplanted two HDV-infected patients, both of whom had active HBV replication before liver transplantation. In one patient, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) recurred four months after transplantation. Two months later, Hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) and HBV-DNA became positive, and the patient died of fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. In the other patient, HBV persisted after transplantation, and 2 months later the patient required retransplantation for fulminant recurrent hepatitis B and hepatitis delta. With the second graft, the patient remained free of HBV infection for 1 year. Thereafter, the patient experienced HBV recurrence with active replication and died of fulminant hepatitis B and delta recurrence. In the first case and in the second graft of the second case, hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) immunoprophylaxis was administered in an attempt to prevent recurrence of HBV. The literature suggests that an HDV infection inhibits the replication of HBV and therefore plays a role in preventing the recurrence of HBV and improving survival. Our experience with two patients suggests that HDV infection, in the presence of active HBV replication, may not play a protective role."
6449,0.004,4.0,"Epidemiological data on hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in Belgium are lacking. A multicenter questionnaire-based registry on HDV infection was collated between March 1, 2008 and February 28, 2009. It consisted of patients coinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV. The data samples were compared to those of a concurrent registry on HBV infection. Prospective data of patients with HBV-HDV coinfection were collected. Active HBV replication is defined as HBeAg positivity or HBV DNA > 2,000 IU/ml. Forty-four patients from 15 centers were registered. A comparison of 29 patients infected with HDV (registered in the concurrent HBV registry) was made against 785 HBV mono-infected patients. The seroprevalence of patients coinfected with HBV and HDV in Belgium is reported to be 3.7% (29/785), consisting solely of the HBV-HDV coinfected patients in the HBV registry. This rises to 5.5% (44/800) if all patients infected with HDV from the two registries combined are included. The patients coinfected with HBV and HDV had higher (P < 0.05) ALT values and more advanced liver disease (Metavir score ≥F2), but had less active HBV replication and lower HBV DNA titers when compared with the patients infected only with HBV. Additionally, the majority of HBV-HDV coinfected patient was male, and 13.6% (6/44) of the patients that were coinfected HBV and HDV were also infected with HCV. In conclusion, this study provided much needed epidemiological data on the current state of HDV infection in Belgium."
2954,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection treated with alpha interferon and subsequent loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) eliminate HDV. HDV RNA was detected in 26 of 28 patients with chronic delta hepatitis using the polymerase chain reaction. Seventeen patients in whom HDV RNA was detected were treated with alpha interferon; in 65%, HDV RNA remained detectable during treatment or reappeared after stopping therapy whereas in three patients HDV RNA remained absent (17.5%). HDV RNA became and remained undetectable in serum and liver of two of these three patients who lost HBsAg from serum and in one patient who was intermittently HBsAg negative during therapy. After loss of HBsAg, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was still detectable in the liver, but not HBV RNA, indicating absent or very low HBV replication. Three patients were lost to follow up (17.5%). Two nontreated patients with chronic HDV infection also lost HBsAg during follow up; HDV RNA also became undetectable in their serum. Thus, HDV replication does not persist after the loss of HBsAg. Clearance of HBsAg may be a useful guide to when therapy can be stopped."
1820,0.004,4.0,"One key step of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the integration of its viral cDNA. This process is mediated through complex networks of host-virus interactions that alter several normal cell functions of the host. To study the complexity of disturbances in cell gene expression networks by HIV-1 integration, we constructed a network of human macrophage genes located close to chromatin regions rich in proviruses. To perform the network analysis, we selected 28 genes previously identified as the target of cDNA integration and their transcriptional profiles were obtained from GEO Profiles (NCBI). A total of 2770 interactions among the 28 genes located around the HIV-1 proviruses in human macrophages formed a highly dense main network connected to five sub-networks. The overall network was significantly enriched by genes associated with signal transduction, cellular communication and regulatory processes. To simulate the effects of HIV-1 integration in infected macrophages, five genes with the most number of interaction in the normal network were turned off by putting in zero the correspondent expression values. The HIV-1 infected network showed changes in its topology and alteration in the macrophage functions reflected in a re-programming of biosynthetic and general metabolic process. Understanding the complex virus-host interactions that occur during HIV-1 integration, may provided valuable genomic information to develop new antiviral treatments focusing on the management of some specific gene expression networks associated with viral integration. This is the first gene network which describes the human macrophages genes interactions related with HIV-1 integration."
8848,0.004,4.0,"Using the Southern blot technique and cloned hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA as a probe, we studied the state of HBV DNA in the liver of 13 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 17 patients with chronic hepatitis, and 2 patients with acute hepatitis. The hybridization results were compared with the serological and immunohistological data. Integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA of the liver from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was demonstrated. In two patients from which tumorous and nontumorous liver tissue samples were available the integration patterns were different. In one patient with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive early hepatocellular carcinoma, free viral DNA was present in the liver. In some patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis, without tumor, integration of HBV DNA in cellular DNA was also demonstrated. This suggests that HBV is not the only factor involved in the development of a tumor. In patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis, free viral DNA was detected in the liver. In the two acute hepatitis patients analyzed, the restriction endonuclease patterns strongly suggested HBV DNA integration. Therefore, viral DNA integration seems to occur early in infection. Whatever the form of the disease, discrete bands were observed, suggesting the existence of limited and specific integration sites in host cellular DNA. The presence of integrated or free DNA sequences has implications for antiviral therapy. In addition, detection of HBV DNA in the liver is another sensitive viral marker that could be useful for diagnostic purposes."
3898,0.004,4.0,"Retroviral integration requires cis-acting sequences at the termini of linear double-stranded viral DNA and a product of the retroviral pol gene, the integrase protein (IN). IN is required and sufficient for generation of recessed 3' termini of the viral DNA (the first step in proviral integration) and for integration of the recessed DNA species in vitro. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN, expressed in Escherichia coli, was purified to near homogeneity. The substrate sequence requirements for specific cleavage and integration of retroviral DNA were studied in a physical assay, using purified IN and short duplex oligonucleotides that correspond to the termini of HIV DNA. A few point mutations around the IN cleavage site substantially reduced cleavage; most other mutations did not have a drastic effect, suggesting that the sequence requirements are limited. The terminal 15 bp of the retroviral DNA were demonstrated to be sufficient for recognition by IN. Efficient specific cutting of the retroviral DNA by IN required that the cleavage site, the phosphodiester bond at the 3' side of a conserved CA-3' dinucleotide, be located two nucleotides away from the end of the viral DNA; however, low-efficiency cutting was observed when the cleavage site was located one, three, four, or five nucleotides away from the terminus of the double-stranded viral DNA. Increased cleavage by IN was detected when the nucleotides 3' of the CA-3' dinucleotide were present as single-stranded DNA. IN was found to have a strong preference for promoting integration into double-stranded rather than single-stranded DNA."
5570,0.004,4.0,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters."
3904,0.004,4.0,"A solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for determining human serum cystatin C is described. In 50 normal samples, cystatin C concentration was 1247 +/- 224 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD) which is in agreement with previously reported levels. Serum levels of cystatin C and beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-M) were investigated in a time-course study during the development of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We found a persistent and uniform increase in the beta 2-M concentration (2762 +/- 1239 micrograms/L). In contrast to beta 2-M, on the basis of cystatin C levels, we found two distinct populations, one of which demonstrated an increased concentration (1620 +/- 618 micrograms/L). Interestingly a second group (21% of patients) exhibited an initial significant decrease in cystatin C concentration with a mean value of 377 (range 55-850) micrograms/L, followed by an increase. The biphasic pattern of cystatin C serum, a major cysteine proteinase inhibitor, during the course of HIV infection suggests a possible role for these proteinases (or proteinase inhibitors) in the development of this syndrome."
3876,0.004,4.0,"We assessed the longitudinal changes in blood myeloid dendritic cell (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) populations in subjects with primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergoing different rates of disease progression. The relative level and degree of maturation of all cell populations decreased significantly in untreated individuals with acute infection. The most dramatic changes were observed in the rapid progressor group, correlating with their rate of clinical progression. Levels of mDCs remained lower than normal throughout follow-up for both rapid progressors who responded to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and untreated normal progressors. In contrast, mDC precursors were restored to normal levels during subsequent phases of infection in both rapid and normal progressors, and these levels were increased in long-term nonprogressors. pDC levels followed the pattern of CD4+ T cell fluctuations. These findings provide evidence for an ongoing process affecting mDCs after successful ART and despite nonprogressing clinical disease following HIV infection."
3503,0.004,4.0,"We have sought to address the problem of the host and tissue specificity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) by using transgenic mice obtained after injection of head-to-tail dimers of the HBV genome. Viral DNA replication and protein synthesis were obtained in one of nine transgenic mice containing integrated HBV DNA. The RNAs encoding the HBV surface antigen and the core antigen were synthesized in the liver, the kidney, and the heart. In these organs, DNA replicative intermediates similar to those found during normal infection were associated with corelike structures. Large amounts of core polypeptides and capsids were detected in the nuclei in the absence of any pathological effect. These results show that the different steps of HBV multiplication can take place in nonliver nonhuman cells once the problem of entry into the host cell is overcome. In the absence of a small laboratory animal infectable by HBV, such transgenic mice should be helpful for the study of many aspects of viral multiplication."
1297,0.004,4.0,"Cross-sectional analyses have demonstrated an association between use of hormonal contraceptives and shedding of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This prospective study evaluated the effect of initiating use of hormonal contraception on cervical HSV detection. Two hundred women who were seropositive for HSV-2 and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 were examined for cervical mucosal HSV by use of quantitative DNA polymerase chain reaction before and after beginning the use of hormonal contraceptives. Cervical HSV was detected in 32 women (16.0%) before initiating and in 25 women (12.5%) after initiating use of hormonal contraception (P=.4). There were no significant differences in HSV shedding among the subgroups of women starting combination oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone or progesterone-only contraceptives. Among the 54 women who shed HSV at least once, the median change in cervical HSV after initiation of hormonal contraception was -313 copies/swab. In this prospective study, use of hormonal contraceptives did not increase detection of cervical HSV."
9951,0.004,4.0,"A randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted to examine the impact of a semistructured, 10-week, once weekly, 90-min/session bereavement support group intervention on immunological, neuroendocrine, and clinical health status in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-seropositive (HIV-1+) and HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-1-) homosexual men, compared to a standard of care control condition. A total of 119 homosexual men (74 HIV-1+ and 45 HIV-1-) were assessed at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months follow-up. At the 6-month follow-up assessment, the intervention groups exhibited significant beneficial effects compared to controls on changes in CD4 cell, total T-lymphocyte, and total lymphocyte counts, when baseline levels, antiretroviral medication use, CDC stage of disease, and other potentially confounding factors were accounted for. There was no statistically significant effect on the CD4/CD8 ratio or on the CD8 cell count. The effect on CD4 cell count was associated with group attendance and with changes in plasma cortisol level. Plasma cortisol levels decreased significantly among intervention subjects, compared to controls. A significantly reduced number of health care visits over the 6-month follow-up period among the intervention subjects supported the clinical relevance of the immunological changes observed for both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- individuals. These results indicate that behavioral interventions may have salutary immunological and clinical health effects following bereavement among HIV-1-infected individuals. The effect in HIV-1- individuals suggests that this bereavement support group intervention might have similar salutary effects in the general population. Potential effects of such interventions on clinical HIV disease progression are of interest and should be studied."
3271,0.004,4.0,"Columbia University's International Centre for AIDS Care and Treatment Programmes (ICAP) supports the establishment of HIV prevention, care and treatment programmes, in resource-limited countries, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In South Africa (SA), ICAP has collaborated with the Eastern Cape Department of Health since 2004, to support HIV treatment and care programmes at public healthcare facilities in rural and urban areas. Adherence, psychosocial and other supportive services have been combined into Wellness Programmes that have been situated within hospital-based Wellness Centres in two rural regions, and integrated within primary healthcare facilities in a third. This paper reviews components of wellness services for people living with HIV/AIDS including: voluntary counselling and testing, disclosure and prevention, ongoing counselling, health literacy and peer education, community- and home-based care, adherence support, and associated comprehensive care continuums. It also describes local context in which the Wellness Programmes were established. Finally it describes processes, successes and challenges, with programme development, and useful indicators monitored, lessons learned and strategies to strengthen and expand such programmes. Insights provided may inform other efforts to create sustainable systems of interdisciplinary care and accessible psychosocial support for HIV-infected persons within public facilities in resource-constrained settings."
4601,0.004,4.0,"Patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is important for effective medical treatment of HIV/AIDS. We conducted a qualitative interview study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia in 2006. The aim of the study was to explore patients' and health care professionals' perceived barriers and facilitators to patients' adherence to ART. Based on data from individual interviews and focus group interviews with a total of 60 patients and 12 health care professionals, we identified barriers and facilitators related to patients' beliefs and behaviours, the health service, and socio-economic and cultural factors. Among the barriers we identified were lack of communication and information about ART, inadequate time during consultations, lack of follow-up and counselling, forgetfulness, stigma, discrimination and disclosure of HIV status, lack of confidentiality in the treatment centres, and lack of nutritional support. Feeling better, prospects of living longer, family support, information about ART, support for income-generating activities, disclosure of HIV status, prayers and transport support were among the facilitators. Our study suggests that several issues need to be considered when providing ART. Further research is needed to study interactions between patients and their health care providers. Our findings can inform interventions to improve adherence to ART."
3709,0.004,4.0,"While community-based mental health services play an important role in caring for persons with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and co-existing mental health disorders, the extent to which their support needs are addressed in this setting is unknown. Accordingly, we examined if HIV infection was associated with unmet support needs among men living with and without HIV receiving community mental health care. This cross-sectional study examined 215 men (135 living with HIV and 80 without HIV) receiving case management services in urban Ontario. Using the Camberwell Assessment of Need, we ascertained the prevalence of support needs in 13 domains grouped into three clusters: Basic needs (accommodation, food, benefits, and money management); self-care/functional needs (daytime activities, self-care, and looking after the home); and health/safety needs (physical, psychological distress, psychotic symptoms, safety to self, and safety to others). We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to examine the association between HIV and unmet need in each domain. Compared to HIV-negative men, men with HIV were more likely to have mood and concurrent disorders, and intellectual and developmental disabilities. Following multivariable analyses, men with HIV had greater unmet needs related to food (odds ratio + 95% confidence interval: 9.36 (4.03, 21.75), p < 0.001); money (OR: 1.90 (1.04, 3.47), p = 0.036) [basic need domains]; psychological distress (OR: 2.39 (1.68, 3.41), p < 0.001); drug use (OR: 5.10 (2.16, 12.08) p < 0.001); and safety to self (OR: 3.35 (1.51, 7.52), p < 0.003) [health and safety domains]. Despite living in a setting with universal health insurance, men with HIV receiving community mental health support had greater unmet need in basic and health domains than HIV-negative men receiving such support. Further research is required to develop and evaluate interventions to best support community-dwelling persons with HIV and mental health disorders."
2683,0.004,4.0,"The randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III DUET studies enrolled treatment-experienced, HIV-1-infected patients. We examined the genotypic and phenotypic changes at endpoint relative to baseline, including the emergence of individual reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations, in patients who received the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) etravirine and experienced virologic failure by rebound by the time of the Week 96 analysis. Patients received etravirine 200 mg twice-daily in combination with a background regimen containing darunavir/ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. Virologic failure by rebound occurred in 93 (15.5%) etravirine-treated patients (compared with 170 [28.1%] placebo-treated patients). Patients experiencing virologic failure had more baseline antiretroviral resistance and lower activity of the background regimen relative to those not experiencing failure. Emergence of NNRTI resistance-associated mutations was observed in 55 of 93 patients. The most frequently emerging RT mutations were V179F, V179I, and Y181C, with positions K101 and E138 also showing frequent changes. Mutations usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI mutations and were, in most cases, associated with a decrease in phenotypic sensitivity to etravirine at endpoint. Further analysis is needed to clarify the role of mutations at position 138 as determinants of etravirine resistance."
7432,0.004,4.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis B virus share common routes of transmission, and hence, coinfection with these two viruses is common. Chronic hepatitis B does not influence the progression of HIV disease or the response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. It is clear, however, that HIV infection does impact the course of hepatitis B, as higher rates of chronic carriage, lower seroconversion rates, and accelerated progression towards cirrhosis have been observed. Vaccination against hepatitis B is less effective in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfected subjects have a poor response to interferon therapy. Lamivudine is more effective in coinfected subjects but must not be used as monotherapy because of the risk of resistance developing. Combination therapy with lamivudine and tenofovir has shown promise and is currently being investigated in clinical trials, while new drugs and other combinations are in development."
6179,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains resistant to nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) may easily be selected for in vitro and in vivo under a suboptimal therapy regimen. Although cross-resistance is extensive within this class of compounds, newer NNRTIs were reported to retain activity against laboratory strains containing defined resistance-associated mutations. We have characterized HIV-1 resistance to loviride and the extent of cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term loviride monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to loviride ranged from 0.04 to 3.47 log10-fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued loviride for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K103N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K103N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations. The Y181C substitution was detected in one isolate which was resistant to loviride and delavirdine but sensitive to efavirenz, HBY-097, and tivirapine. Our data indicate that the available newer NNRTIs which retain activity against some HIV-1 strains selected by other compounds of this class in vitro may have compromised clinical efficacy in some patients pretreated with NNRTI."
2026,0.004,4.0,"We estimate how the effect of antiretroviral treatment depends on the time from HIV-infection to initiation of treatment, using observational data. A major challenge in making inferences from such observational data arises from biases associated with the nonrandom assignment of treatment, for example bias induced by dependence of time of initiation on disease status. To address this concern, we develop a new class of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) to estimate the impact of time of initiation of treatment after infection on an outcome measured a fixed duration after initiation, compared to the effect of not initiating treatment. This leads to a SNMM that models the effect of multiple dosages of treatment on a time-dependent outcome, in contrast to most existing SNNMs, which focus on the effect of one dosage of treatment on an outcome measured at the end of the study. Our identifying assumption is that there are no unmeasured confounders. We illustrate our methods using the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP) Core01 database on HIV. The current standard of care in HIV-infected patients is Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Treatment (HAART); however, the optimal time to start HAART has not yet been identified. The new class of SNNMs allows estimation of the dependence of the effect of 1 year of HAART on the time between estimated date of infection and treatment initiation, and on patient characteristics. Results of fitting this model imply that early use of HAART substantially improves immune reconstitution in the early and acute phase of HIV-infection."

Review of the literature on leptospirosis in HIV-infected persons showed that all patients were severely ill but responded well to treatment, which highlights the importance of recognizing this potentially life-threatening illness, especially in unusual settings."
1511,0.004,4.0,"With the increasing availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy, vertically infected children have a better chance of surviving into adolescence and adulthood. Additionally, sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a problem, and incidence and prevalence among youth remain high. Therefore, HIV-infected adolescents are becoming a more prominent sub-group in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Experience from the developed world indicates that providing effective care and treatment for adolescents poses unique challenges. This study aimed to identify the experiences and needs of adolescents growing up in care or on treatment for HIV in Cape Town, South Africa. Four focus groups interviews were conducted with a total of 26 young people attending an adolescent infectious diseases clinic at a tertiary hospital. Questions explored participant's perceptions on their present and future lives, and their self-identified needs. Focus groups revealed that adolescents viewed their illness negatively, but that social issues such as violence and poverty were also concerns. Despite these stressors, most respondents remained positive about the present and future, and wanted support for achieving their goals. As increasing numbers of HIV-infected children enter adolescence, healthcare providers and communities must find ways to support these young people to transition into adulthood."
8226,0.004,4.0,"Although HIV positive patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is relatively high in African nations, as compared with industrialized nations, few studies have explored why. In the research presented here we aimed to understand the dynamics of good adherence to ART among patients receiving free ART and HIV-related services from a clinic in Arusha, Tanzania. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 6 health care providers and 36 patients at a health care center in Arusha in 2006. Interviews were conducted in Swahili using interview guides informed by social cognitive theory. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed in Kiswahili, translated into English and coded for themes and patterns with ATLAS.ti. Of the 36 patients interviewed (mean time on ART 9.8 months; range 1-23 months), 32 reported perfect adherence in the previous month. Self-reported adherence was high despite economic hardship, depression, low rates of HIV disclosure and high perceived HIV-associated stigma. Five factors emerged to explain excellent adherence in the face of such barriers. First, all respondents experienced substantial improvements in their health after starting ART; this supported their confidence in the medication and motivated them to adhere. Second, their perceived need to be able to meet their family responsibilities motivated respondents to stay healthy. Third, respondents developed specific strategies to remember to take pills, particularly routinizing pill-taking by linking it with daily activities or events. Fourth, material and emotional support received from others facilitated adherence. Finally, respondents trusted the advice and instructions of their health care providers, who regularly emphasized adherence. The facilitating factors identified were consistent with the constructs of social cognitive theory and highlighted the importance of interventions that address multiple levels of influence on adherence."
6954,0.004,4.0,"We documented HIV-risk behavior and the public health context of AIDS in women living with a severe and persistent mental illness. Sixty-one women were recruited from outpatient clinics and day-treatment programs at a state psychiatric hospital. They completed a survey that included measures of HIV-related risk behavior, the perceived importance of 11 public health and social problems including AIDS, HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, perceived risk, and behavioral intentions. Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in at least one type of HIV-risk behavior during the 2 months before assessment, 23% reported two or more risk factors, and 16% reported three or more risk factors. Consistent condom use was rare. Participants reporting 1 or more risk factors were more likely than those reporting no risk to report histories of alcohol or drug treatment, sexually transmitted diseases, HIV testing, and more perceived risk of HIV infection. Poverty and unemployment were viewed as more serious problems than HIV infection and AIDS. HIV-prevention interventions that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women with a severe mental illness are urgently needed to prevent further infections."
4240,0.004,4.0,"Highly active antiretroviral treatment is compromised by viral resistance mutations. Transmitted drug resistance (TDR) is therefore monitored closely, but follow-up studies of these patients are limited. Virus from 1405 individuals diagnosed with HIV-1 in Denmark between 2001 and 2009 was analyzed for TDR, and molecular-epidemiological links and progression of the infection were described based on data from standardized questionnaires, the prospective Danish HIV Cohort Study, and by phylogenetic analysis. Eighty-five individuals were found to be infected with virus harboring mutations resulting in a prevalence of 6.1%, with no changes over time. The main resistance mutations were nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutation 215 revertants, as well as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutation 103N/S and protease inhibitor (PI) mutations 90M and 85V. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed 12 transmission chains involving 37 TDR individuals. Of these 21 were also documented epidemiologically. The virus included in the transmission chain carried similar resistance mutations to the TDR index case, whereas controls chains from index cases without TDR were generally without resistance mutations. We observed no difference in progression of the infection between individuals infected with TDR and individuals infected with wild-type HIV-1. The prevalence of TDR is low in Denmark and transmission of dual-drug-resistant HIV-1 is infrequent. The TDR isolates were shown to originate from local patients failing therapy."
878,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major issue among dialysis patients. It is associated with a high risk of hepatic complication. The liver disease runs a unique clinical course in dialysis patients, as it can progress with modest hepatic inflammation and prominent fibrosis. The conventional cut-off level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for commencing antiviral therapy may prove too high and inappropriate for dialysis patients, and liver biopsy appears to be the only definitive means to establish the activity of liver disease in dialysis patients. Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a serum ALT level that is persistently greater than 30 IU/L, or 0.75-fold the upper limit of the normal level, and/or other clinical and laboratory findings that suggest active liver disease. For antiviral treatment, preliminary reports have shown that lamivudine is effective and well tolerated in dialysis patients. However, the long-term efficacy of lamivudine and its optimal effective dose in dialysis patients remain unknown. The prevention of nosocomial transmission among dialysis patients is also important. Universal precaution measures should be strictly observed and the segregation of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive hemodialysis patients should be considered. For HBV non-immune patients, the importance of HBV vaccination should not be overemphasized. Until a new generation of highly immunogenic vaccines that are proven to be safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease becomes available, early vaccination before the development of end-stage renal failure remains the best way to secure immunological protection against HBV infection in dialysis patients."
904,0.004,4.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) is a complex phenomenon and patients do not always adhere for a variety of reasons. The quality of communication and the therapeutic relationship between health professionals and patients have an important influence on adherence, as do contextual and environmental factors. Little qualitative research exists that examines health care interactions in the context of adherence counselling. This article presents a case study of a discussion about nonadherence between a pharmacy assistant and a patient in a South African HIV context. A hybrid analytical approach revealed various themes such as how the topic of nonadherence is addressed, participants' responses to the patient's nonadherence, and the process of negotiating a new commitment to adherence. The case provides insight into the impact of contextual factors on the interaction and challenges involved in discussing nonadherence-in particular, the patient's attempts to save face, the pharmacy assistant's irritation and anger, and the patient's expressed regrets. This case raises questions around issues of patient agency. Health professionals are encouraged to consider the influence of context, lifeworld, and culture on patients' ability to adhere to treatment regimens. By working to improve communication processes and strengthen the therapeutic relationship, patients may be empowered to achieve better adherence levels."
9394,0.004,4.0,"Taken as prescribed, that is, with high adherence, combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV infection and disease from being a sure predictor of death to a manageable chronic illness. Adherence, however, is difficult to achieve and maintain. The CAPRISA 058 study was conducted between 2007 and 2009 to test the efficacy of individualized motivational counselling to enhance ART adherence in South Africa. As part of the overall trial, a qualitative sub-study was conducted, including 30 individual interviews and four focus group discussions with patients in the first 9 months of ART initiation. Data were inductively analyzed, using thematic analysis, to identify themes central to ART adherence in this context. Four themes emerged that characterize the participants' experiences and high motivation to adhere to ART. Participants in this study were highly motivated to adhere, as they acknowledged that ART was 'life-giving', in the face of a large amount of morbidity and mortality. They were further supported by techniques of routine remembering, and highlighted the importance of good social support and access to supportive healthcare workers, to their continued success in negotiating their treatment. Participants in the current study told us that their adherence motivation is enhanced by free accessible care, approachable and supportive healthcare workers, broad social acceptance of ART, and past first-hand experiences with AIDS-related co-morbidity and mortality. Programs that include specific attention to these aspects of care will likely be successful in the long term."
8125,0.004,4.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB), and HIV TB coinfection is associated with higher mortality. This study aimed to characterize patients coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV in a reference centre for cases involving complications or drug resistance in TB. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a Hospital for Tropical Diseases in the state of Goiás, Midwestern Brazil. Patients' medical records were reviewed between January 2008 and December 2009. Sixty-one cases of TB/HIV coinfection were evaluated, and 54 HIV-seronegative TB cases were selected as controls. The prevalence of TB HIV coinfected patients in 2008/2009 was 23%. Coinfection was more prevalent in men (75.4%), with a mean age of 37.1 years. Pulmonary disease (50.8%) was the most frequent clinical form of TB in coinfected patients, followed by disseminated disease (32.8%). Anaemia, malnutrition and low levels of CD4 T lymphocytes were found in about 80% of coinfected patients. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were the most common radiographic finding in coinfected patients (51.8%), and pulmonary cavitation was the rarest event (5.4%). The mortality rate was 2.8 times higher in the TB HIV coinfected group (39.3%) than in TB patients without HIV (18.5%). Actions targeting the TB HIV-coinfected population, based on national and international recommendations, are necessary to improve prognosis and outcomes in TB and HIV infection in the institution."
5997,0.004,4.0,"We compared the lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses to Cryptosporidium parvum in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive and -seronegative patients. The lymphoproliferative and cytokine responses (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, gamma interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) were assessed for 11 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-positive (group I) patients; 20 HIV-seropositive, Cryptosporidium-negative (group II) patients; 10 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-positive (group III) patients, including four post-renal transplant (group IIIa) and 6 presumably immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients; and 20 HIV-seronegative, Cryptosporidium-negative healthy individuals (group IV). No significant difference was observed in the number of patients showing positive lymphoproliferative responses in group I compared to group III (post-renal transplant [group IIIa] or immunocompetent [group IIIb]) patients, while a comparison of the median stimulation indices shows that responses were significantly lower in Cryptosporidium-infected, immunosuppressed (group I and IIIa) patients than in immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients. The number of patients showing positive responses and median stimulation indices was significantly higher for Cryptosporidium-infected (HIV-seropositive and -seronegative) individuals than for uninfected individuals, suggesting that Cryptosporidium induces significant in vitro lymphoproliferative responses in infected individuals. Cytokine levels, except for that of IL-5, were significantly higher in Cryptosporidium-infected (groups I and III) individuals than in uninfected (groups II and IV) individuals. There was no significant difference between the group I and III patients and between Cryptosporidium-infected immunosuppressed (group I or IIIa) and immunocompetent (group IIIb) patients."
9447,0.004,4.0,"Enteroparasites are related to gastrointestinal alterations among patients with HIV/AIDS, some causing severe manifestations in the period before the institution of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The prevalence of enteroparasitoses in patients with HIV/AIDS seen at two hospitals in Ceará , Brazil, was compared in the pre-HAART (Group 1; n = 482) and HAART (Group 2; n = 100) eras. Fecal parasitologic examinations (FPE) were performed using the direct, Lutz, Baermann-Moraes and modified Ziehl-Neelsen methods. The following parasites were detected in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: Strongyloides stercoralis--30.1% and 11% (p<0.0001), Ascaris lumbricoides--15.6% and 2% (p<0.0001), hookworms--3.7% and 2% (p<0.0001), Trichuris trichiura--13.1% and 1% (p<0.0001), Hymenolepis nana--0 and 1% (p = 0.1718), Giardia duodenalis--7.9% and 1% (p = 0.0076), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar--3.3% and 1% (p = 0.3301), Isospora belli--4.8% and 1% (p = 0.0993), Cryptosporidium sp.--8.1% and 0 (p = 0.0007), and non-pathogenic protozoans as well. There was a significant reduction in the prevalence of enteroparasites between the eras (63.9% to 24%; p<0.0001). In the HAART era, the following observations were made: greater frequency of enteroparasites in patients without antiretroviral therapy (p = 0.0575), as in those with AIDS (p = 0.08), and diarrhea (36% of the patients); lack of association with positive FPE (p = 0.626); and non-detection of Cryptosporidium sp. Strongyloides stercoralis showed an elevated prevalence in the two eras and was more frequent in men (32.41%) than women (19.04%) of Group 1 (p = 0.018), a finding suggesting the transmission of the helminth through sodomy. The advent of the HAART modified the profile of opportunistic infections, including parasites, probably due to the reconstitution of cellular immunity and the direct action of HAART on the parasites."
9387,0.004,4.0,"Measurement of quality of life is crucial to assess the full impact of antiretroviral therapy on patient morbidity. No quality of life instruments have been validated in an Asian HIV-infected patient population, but it is important to do so given the increasing involvement of the region in clinical trials. We set out to validate the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) in HIV infected patients in Singapore. Clinically stable outpatients were asked to complete the 30-item MOS-HIV (English or Chinese translation). Patients were also asked about the frequency of selected disease symptoms, and clinical and demographic data were recorded from the case sheet. 163 patients (90% Chinese, 96% male, mean age 38 years, mean CD4 count 159 cells/mm(3)) participated in the study and completed the questionnaire to a satisfactory standard. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.7 in all cases). There were significant differences in quality of life scores between Centers for Disease Control disease stages, and significant correlations with CD4 count and symptom score, confirming the discriminant validity of the MOS-HIV. Factor analysis revealed two components corresponding to physical and mental health which were similar to those of studies in Western countries except that pain was more closely related to mental than physical health. Linear regression analysis identified symptom burden as the major predictor of physical and mental health. We concluded that the MOS-HIV is a valid measure of quality of life in this HIV patient population in Singapore, and is therefore likely to be useful in future clinical trials in the region. In the era of chronic HIV disease, close attention to symptoms (disease or drug-related) is warranted due to their major adverse influence on mental and physical aspects of quality of life."
9415,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is classified into subtypes on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of sequence differences. Inter- and intra-subtype polymorphism extends throughout the genome, including the long terminal repeat (LTR). In this study, the importance of the upstream stimulating factor (USF)-binding site (E-box) in the core-negative regulatory element (NRE) of the LTR of HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D, E and G was investigated. In vivo, USF was found to repress transcription directed from representative HIV-1 LTR sequences of all the subtypes tested in an epithelial cell line, yet activate the same transcription in a T-cell line. Mutation of the core-NRE USF site of the representative subtype B LTR did not affect the cell-specific, subtype-independent, dual role of USF. In vitro binding assays showed that recombinant USF(43) interacts with the core-NRE from subtypes B and C, but not A, D, E or G. Thus, USF affects LTR-directed transcription in a cell-specific manner, independently of both the HIV-1 subtype from which the LTR was derived and the core-NRE USF site sequences."
9892,0.004,4.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections with different genotypes and subgenotypes differ in response to treatment and long-term prognosis. The differences emerge from variability within the genomes that leads to structural deviations at the pregenomic level and to changes at the translational level. Naturally occurring HBV strains covering the four major genotypes A-D were obtained from 393 patients and part of the genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and analyzed for mutational differences in the precore and core promoter regions. The study confirmed that core promoter and precore mutations occur at key positions (A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A), and that the proportions of strains with seroconvertion in patients differ between the four HBV genotypes. A rare double mutation (C1857T together with G1897A) was observed, and C1856T was found together with the emerging G1898A mutation, which itself was found to be more widespread geographically than previously described. We found a novel mutation (T1850C), never before observed in human HBV strains but known from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). A novel association of mutation C1773T with G1764T, C1766A, and G1757A was also found within a site already suggested to be a putative binding site for HNF-3. This novel association is proposed by us to be of importance for additional binding of HNH-2 to this site and is a better indicator of the emergence of the double mutation G1764T and C1766A than the G1757A mutation proposed previously."
3179,0.004,4.0,"The number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier babies has decreased markedly since the introduction in Japan of an ""at-risk"" strategy for preventing HBV infection. However, elimination of HBV infection from our country appears difficult. To clarify the limitations of the at-risk strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV, causes of vertical transmission in a single hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The following causes were presumed in 17 carrier pediatric cases: five patients had prenatal HBV infection, HBV infection during/after the immunization program was confirmed in five cases, two patients had prenatal infection or infection during the immunization program and three cases were caused by human error (by the patients' guardians). Because their mothers were HBV-negative at screening and only developed acute hepatitis B in the perinatal period, another two cases (Cases 3 and 10) did not undergo immunization because they were not subjects of the at-risk strategy. Sequence analyses in ten patients revealed genotype C (subgenotype, C2/Ce) in nine cases and genotype A (subgenotype, A2/Ae) in one case (Case 3). In Japan, HBV subgenotype Ae has recently been found more frequently among sexually active men with acute hepatitis. There are concerns that horizontal transmission of HBV from these men to their pregnant partners could increase. These data suggest clear limitations to the at-risk strategy in Japan and the possibility that the increase in genotype A may influence vertical transmission of HBV."
6454,0.004,4.0,"The implementation of antiretroviral therapy demands the need for increased access to viral load (VL) monitoring. Newer real-time VL testing technologies are faster and have larger dynamic ranges and fully automated extraction to benefit higher throughputs in resource-poor environments. The Abbott RealTime human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) assay was evaluated as a new option for testing for HIV-1 subtype C in South Africa, and its performance was compared to the performance of existing assays (the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1, version 1, assay; the AmpliPrep-Cobas Monitor standard HIV-1 assay; and the NucliSENS EasyQ-EasyMag HIV-1 assay) in a high-throughput laboratory. The total precision of the RealTime HIV-1 assay was acceptable over all viral load ranges. This assay compared most favorably with the Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan HIV-1 assay (R(2) = 0.904), with a low standard deviation of difference being detected (0.323 copies/ml). The bias against comparator assays ranged from -0.001 copies/ml to -0.228 copies/ml. Variability in the reporting of VLs for a 20-member subtype panel compared to the variability of other assays was noted with subtypes G and CRF02-AG. The RealTime HIV-1 assay can test 93 samples per day with minimal manual preparation, less staff, and the minimization of contamination through automation. This assay is suitable for HIV-1 subtype C VL quantification in South Africa."
1434,0.004,4.0,"Patients with resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection undergoing chemo- or immunosuppressive therapy are at potential risk for HBV reactivation. To determine whether the host immune response contributes to liver injury, we performed an immunological analysis of a patient with HBV reactivation. Consistent with the detection of HBV DNA in the sera, the number of polyclonal HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased; however, the number of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) decreased. The interaction between HBV-specific CTLs and CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg is an important determinant of liver injury during HBV reactivation. Therefore, monitoring the number of these cells might be a useful modality for the diagnosis of acute hepatitis resulting from HBV reactivation. "
7462,0.004,4.0,"The 1990 report of a cluster of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with a Florida dentist with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome attracted considerable media coverage and legislative attention. A number of polls found that the public favored mandatory HIV-antibody testing of health-care workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga, conducted a two-phase study to understand how public concerns regarding potential HIV transmission in health-care settings can be addressed by the medical and public health communities."
2010,0.004,4.0,"BACKGROUND In November and December 2012, 6 patients at a hemodialysis clinic were given a diagnosis of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. OBJECTIVE To investigate the outbreak to identify risk factors for transmission. METHODS A case patient was defined as a patient who was HCV-antibody negative on clinic admission but subsequently was found to be HCV-antibody positive from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013. Patient charts were reviewed to identify and describe case patients. The hypervariable region 1 of HCV from infected patients was tested to assess viral genetic relatedness. Infection control practices were evaluated via observations. A forensic chemiluminescent agent was used to identify blood contamination on environmental surfaces after cleaning. RESULTS Eighteen case patients were identified at the clinic from January 1, 2008, through April 30, 2013, resulting in an estimated 16.7% attack rate. Analysis of HCV quasispecies identified 4 separate clusters of transmission involving 11 case patients. The case patients and previously infected patients in each cluster were treated in neighboring dialysis stations during the same shift, or at the same dialysis station on 2 consecutive shifts. Lapses in infection control were identified. Visible and invisible blood was identified on multiple surfaces at the clinic. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiologic and laboratory data confirmed transmission of HCV among numerous patients at the dialysis clinic over 6 years. Infection control breaches were likely responsible. This outbreak highlights the importance of rigorous adherence to recommended infection control practices in dialysis settings."

6268,0.004,4.0,"Nine black children aged between 3 months and 30 months of age, with human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) infection are described to draw the attention of health professionals in southern Africa to special clinical characteristics useful for recognising this problem, which has many shared features with common diseases of infancy and childhood in the Third World. The main presenting complaints were chronic cough and persistent diarrhoea and vomiting. These children frequently had diarrhoea (8 of 9 patients), mucocutaneous candidiasis (8), pneumonia (7), hepatosplenomegaly (9), significant lymphadenopathy (5) and wasting (5). All were infected by common bacteria, such as Gram-negative organisms, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Campylobacter jejuni, or by opportunistic infections such as Candida or cytomegalovirus (CMV), or by both bacterial and opportunistic organisms. A raised total serum globulin level, anaemia, lymphopenia and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were frequent findings. Incomplete data on parental HIV status suggest perinatal transmission. Three of the children were HIV-antigen positive. The diagnosis of full-blown acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), using the stringent Centers for Disease Control criteria, is difficult in our situation because of limited diagnostic resources; however, using these criteria, and the clinical case definition for AIDS recommended by World Health Organisation, it is thought that probably 4 of these children could be considered as having AIDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6065,0.004,4.0,"Blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission of infections to the recipient. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of transfusion transmissible infections and the possible risk factors among blood donors. During the study period (1994-99) donor samples were screened for HBsAg, HIV, HCV and Syphilis. The relevant donor history was examined to identify the risk factors leading to transfusion transmissible infections. The prevalence of infection was 3.1% among donors, with HBsAg constituting 1.3%, HCV 1.4%, HIV 0.2% and RPR 0.2%. In a classification based on occupation, class III donors (drivers, Businessmen & men in uniform) showed a significantly higher incidence of transfusion transmissible infections for HIV (0.38%) and Syphilis (0.36%). Health care workers constituted only a small fraction of the study; prevalence of infections was low among them. History of jaundice or hospitalization was not associated with higher incidence of seropositivity. Seropositivity for HIV is relatively low compared to similar studies conducted in other regions of the country. This finding is attributed to the pre donation counseling in donor selection. An important outcome of the study is that Class III donors form a high-risk group for transfusion transmissible infections."

10005,0.004,4.0,"North American mission boards (N = 82) with programs in sub-Saharan Africa were surveyed to identify practices affecting risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among international staff. Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers. Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad. Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers. The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program. We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible. Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery."
5762,0.004,4.0,"The worldwide implementation of free antiretroviral therapy (ART) raised great hopes among policy makers and health organisations about the positive changes it would bring about in attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS, as well as for infected people's lives. A change in illness perception was anticipated, leading to the hypothesis of a possible change in disclosure rates, patterns and the choice of significant others to inform. In the era of free treatment availability in the United Republic of Tanzania, we examined reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure among HIV-seropositive women enrolled on ART and their choice of significant others to inform. In so doing, we contribute to the necessary yet neglected debate about the social impact of ART on the lives of infected women. The study, for which an ethnographic cross-sectional pilot approach was chosen, was conducted at the Care and Treatment Center (CTC) at Bombo Regional Hospital (BRH) in Tanga city, Tanzania. Data presented here derive from participant observation, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 59 HIV-seropositive women on ART. Interestingly, and despite treatment availability, the choice of significant others to inform, as well as reasons for disclosure and non-disclosure, mirror findings from previous studies conducted before the introduction of free ART. The main reason for non-disclosure was fear of discrimination. The hope for social, economic or health support was the main motivation for disclosure, followed by the need for a 'clinic companion' in order to receive ART, as requested by hospital staff. Nevertheless, healthcare staff were not unanimous in thinking that disclosure is always beneficial, thus the recommended extent of disclosure varied. ART and concomitant factors were raised as an entirely new and significant reason for disclosure by interviewees. Finally, findings confirm that despite ART, disclosure remains a highly stressful event for women. "
4724,0.004,4.0,"Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."
166,0.004,4.0,"To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains in the lungs of infected individuals are derived from proviral forms contemporaneously present in the peripheral blood or whether they evolve independently as an autonomous pool of viral quasispecies, HIV-1 envelope V3 domain structures at these sites were analyzed and compared. The V3 loop proviral nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences from lung bronchoalveolar lavage, where HIV-1 is primarily found in macrophages, were more homogeneous within individuals than those from unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, where virus is predominantly in T cells. Comparison between individuals revealed that strains from bronchoalveolar lavage, but not from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, contained V3 domain nucleotide sequences with a great degree of homogeneity in the C-terminal region and a highly conserved, negatively charged amino acid motif. This V3 loop C-terminal structure could be important in the ability of HIV-1 to infect alveolar macrophages. Phylogenetic analyses of V3 domain nucleotide sequences in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage at both sites revealed the strains in lung macrophages to have evolved further from a presumed ancestral species than those in blood monocytes and to differ considerably in the inferred V3 loop amino acid structures. These results show that, as disease progression occurs, viral strains in monocyte/macrophage lineage cells within the lung and blood microenvironments are not in a state of unrestricted bidirectional traffic but, instead, evolve independently."

This process may evolve with adverse clinical phenomena, known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). In the HIV population, non-tuberculous mycobacteria are a common cause of IRIS. However, only a few cases of Mycobacterium xenopi associated IRIS have been described. This paper concerns a case of M. xenopi pulmonary infection resulting in self-limited immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-1 infected patient."
5992,0.004,4.0,"In HIV-infected patients a low CD4:CD8 ratio can persist despite CD4 recovery with long-term antiretroviral treatment (ART). As CD4:CD8 inversion is considered a marker of immune-senescence, we aimed to assess if it was associated with the chronic inflammation state in aging patients with HIV. A total of 112 patients with a >15 year history of HIV infection and ART were included, 85 of whom were suppressed. All subjects were tested for interleukin (IL)-6, high-sensitivity (hs)-PCR, and D-dimer levels. Complete clinical, therapeutic, and hematochemical data were retrieved. Coreceptor tropism based on HIV-DNA gp120 genotyping was also available within the past 6 months. A progressive increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio over time was observed without reaching a plateau. Based on the CD4:CD8 ratio at the time of testing, patients were classified into group A (normal ratio ≥0.9) and group B (<0.9). A normal ratio was observed in 37% of patients. Variables associated with an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio were older age, nadir CD4, and detectable HIV viremia. No association between HIV subtype, coreceptor tropism, cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfections and CD4:CD8 ratio was observed. Group B patients showed a trend for a higher frequency of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia compared to group A patients, but they did not differ in IL-6, hs-PCR, and D-dimer levels or in frequency of severe non-AIDS-associated events. In conclusion, CD4:CD8 ratio normalization occurs rarely, even after several years of ART. Chronic inflammation in patients aging with HIV does not seem to be directly dependent on the CD4:CD8 ratio. However, the persistent immune dysregulation expressed by a CD4:CD8 inversion might be linked to a higher risk of non-AIDS events, especially metabolic disorders."
1865,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) infects about two million people worldwide. HIV-2 has fewer treatment options than HIV-1, yet may evolve drug resistance more quickly. We have analysed several novel drugs for anti-HIV-2 activity. It was observed that 5-azacytidine, clofarabine, gemcitabine and resveratrol have potent anti-HIV-2 activity. The EC50 values for 5-azacytidine, clofarabine and resveratrol were found to be significantly lower with HIV-2 than with HIV-1. A time-of-addition assay was used to analyse the ability of these drugs to interfere with HIV-2 replication. Reverse transcription was the likely target for antiretroviral activity. Taken together, several novel drugs have been discovered to have activity against HIV-2. Based upon their known activities, these drugs may elicit enhanced HIV-2 mutagenesis and therefore be useful for inducing HIV-2 lethal mutagenesis. In addition, the data are consistent with HIV-2 reverse transcriptase being more sensitive than HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to dNTP pool alterations. "
4382,0.004,4.0,"We have been investigating a long-term nonprogressor who was found to be human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seropositive in 1985 and has survived with stable CD4+ T-cell counts (>1,000 CD4 cells/microl) without any AIDS-related illness. We have previously reported that repeated attempts to measure HIV-1 RNA in the peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from this subject have invariably failed. In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies infecting this patient by PCR amplification of two proviral regions, the 5' long terminal repeat (5'LTR)/gag leader and the nef gene, directly from fresh uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells, followed by length polymorphism analysis (with 1994, 1995, and 1996 samples) and sequencing (with a 1996 sample). Only proviral forms with nef deletions were revealed by length polymorphism analysis in samples from all three time points. Sequence analysis of the nef gene from the 1996 sample confirmed the presence of similar proviral quasispecies characterized by the presence of several deletions located in the nef-alone and the nef/U3 overlapping regions. Length polymorphism analysis of the 5'LTR/gag leader region suggested the existence of two major quasispecies populations, one characterized by the presence of forms carrying deletions in the U3 region and the other showing a completely intact, full-length 5'LTR. Evidence of the role of nef gene defects in long-term survival of HIV-1-infected patients has been provided so far in two independent investigations involving patients infected with HIV through blood transfusion. Here we show the existence of a similar condition in a subject who acquired HIV-1 seropositivity through the sexual route."

Sixty-six patients with CHB were enrolled. Hepatitis markers and hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) were tested using micro particle enzyme immunoassay kits. Viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the mutation was analyzed by nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Most of CHB patients were HBeAg (-ve). The HBeAg status did not have an influence on the presence or absence of T1762/A1764 mutation. HBV-DNA serum level was not significantly different in patients with core mutation and patients without core mutation in HBeAg (-ve) group, while in HBeAg (+ve) group HBV-DNA serum level was significantly higher in patients with core mutation.

Forty two of the patients (65%) and 25 controls (36%) were HBsAg positive. Anti-HBc was demonstrated in over 80% and in 84% of the study groups respectively. Over 70% of hepatitis B infection was anicteric and traditional surgical intervention correlated with prevalence of PLC. The data provide support for the etiological role of HBV in Nigerian patients with PLC; this is the first report that the incidence of PLC is highest in the northern Savannah region of Nigeria.
2430,0.004,4.0,"As thymocyte infection may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for CD4+ T lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1-infected individuals, we studied the occurrence of HIV-1 infection in the thymus in vivo. Thymus (THYPD) and peripheral blood (PBLPD) primary viral isolates were obtained from an HIV-1-infected patient; restriction pattern analysis revealed the presence of a viral variant (THY) in the thymus isolate, from which biological viral clones containing this variant were obtained by limiting dilution infection of Molt-3 cells. The biological phenotype of the viral isolates and THY clones was studied in different cell lines and primary cultures. PBLPD, THYPD, and THY clones could efficiently infect T cell lines; the thymic variant showed a higher cytopathic activity in T cell lines, and a higher replication capacity in both unfractionated and CD4+CD8(+)-enriched primary thymocytes. Sequence analysis of the viral population patterns in vivo confirmed the presence of the THY variant in the thymic compartment, and revealed that the degree of V3 loop heterogeneity was higher in the thymocytes of the patient than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. In addition to confirming thymocyte infection in vivo, our data also indicate that a differential distribution of viral variants may occur among different body compartments in a single individual; the emergence of cytopathic and tissue-specific variants in the thymus may play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 disease."
2509,0.004,4.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1-infected individuals can efficiently suppress HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T lymphocytes. To elucidate the molecular events underlying this suppression, we have used the HIV-1 LTR directing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) in transient transfection assays using human Jurkat T cells. In addition to supernatants of patient CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD4+ > 350/microliters), supernatant of a T cell clone derived by Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-mediated transformation of CD8+ T lymphocytes of a patient demonstrating inhibition of virus replication were examined. Similar levels of inhibition of LTR-mediated gene expression in response to Tat or mitogenic activation with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore were observed by supernatants of both sources. The inhibitory effect of CD8+ T lymphocytes was not exclusive to lentiviral LTRs since transcription of both the HTLV-I LTR and RSV LTR in response to mitogen was effectively inhibited. In examination of the influence of CD8+ T cell-derived supernatant on NF kappa B-mediated activation, a dimer of the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements directing CAT was markedly inhibited by supernatants of both patient CD8+ lymphocytes and the HVS-derived CD8+ clone. Thus the inhibitory nature of CD8+ T lymphocytes appears not to be specific to lentiviral promoters and may mediate an inhibitory effect via the NF kappa B element."
5453,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB) are overlapping epidemics that cause an immense burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa. This region is home to the majority of the world's co-infected patents, who have higher TB case fatality and recurrence rates than patients with TB alone. A World Health Organization interim policy has been developed to reduce the joint burden of TB-HIV disease, an important component of which is provision of HIV care to co-infected patients. This review focuses on HIV testing of TB patients and, for those who are HIV-positive, the administration of adjunctive cotrimoxazole preventive treatment (CPT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV testing has moved from a voluntary, client-initiated intervention to one that is provider-initiated and a routine part of the diagnostic work-up. The efficacy and safety of CPT in HIV-infected patients is now well established, and this is an essential part of the package of HIV care. ART scale-up in Africa can substantially improve outcomes in co-infected patients. However, the clinical and programmatic challenges of combining ART with anti-tuberculosis treatment need to be resolved to realise the full potential of this benefit. These include the optimal time to start ART, how best to combine rifampicin-containing regimens with first-line and second-line ART regimens, management of immune reconstitution disease, the role of isoniazid preventive treatment with ART after TB treatment completion, and where and how to provide combined treatment to best suit the patient. Clinical and operational studies in the next few years should help to resolve some of these issues."

This study characterized the prevalence of cigarette smoking among HIV-infected Russian women and examined the association between smoking frequency and quantity and HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. HIV-infected Russian women (N = 250; M age = 30.0) in St. Petersburg, Russia, completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview survey assessing cigarette use, antiretroviral medication adherence, and provided blood samples assayed for HIV viral load and CD4+ lymphocyte counts. The majority (60.4%) reported cigarette smoking in the past month; 49.0% of recent smokers were classified as moderate or heavy smokers, defined as smoking ≥10 cigarettes daily. Viral load status did not differ between infrequent smokers and regular smokers. However, moderate/heavy smokers (relative to light smokers) were more likely to have a detectable viral load (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1, 5.1). There were no significant differences in CD4+ lymphocyte counts by smoking frequency or quantity of cigarettes smoked. Results highlight the need for additional research to examine the association between cigarette smoking and virologic suppression and markers of HIV disease progression. Adverse health consequences of cigarette smoking coupled with a potential link between heavy smoking and poor virologic suppression highlight the need for assessment of cigarette use and provision of evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions within HIV medical care."

Subjects were contacted prior to a scheduled appointment and asked to bring all their medications to the visit. Daily total pill burden and medication type were recorded. 151 subjects were recruited: 76% male, 58% African American, 97% receiving antiretrovirals (ARVs). Median age was 48 (IRQ: 42-54) years. The median number of medications per subject was 8 (IQR: 6-11), and the median individual daily pill burden was 8 pills (IQR: 5-15): 3 pills (range: 2-5) for ARVs and 6 (range: 3-12.5) pills for non-ARVs. Duration of ART (per 2 years increase) and more than 3 co-morbidities was significantly associated with high pill burden (over 10 pills per day) with adjusted OR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.14-3.84) and 8.04 (95% CI, 2.30-28.15), respectively.

1553,0.004,4.0,"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and C virus (HCV) are common in patients with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB). This is a cross-sectional study with patients infected with HIV/AIDS and active TB in Recife, Brazil, aiming to verify the prevalence of markers for HBV: antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc); and HCV: antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by chemiluminescence, and to identify the frequency of associated factors. Data were collected through questionnaires, and blood was drawn from patients for analysis. We used the chi-square test and the Fisher exact test when necessary. We conducted a bivariate logistic regression analysis and the magnitude of the associations was expressed as odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95%. Among 166 patients studied with HIV/AIDS and active TB, anti-HBc was positive in 61 patients [36.7%; 95%CI (29.4-44.6%)] and anti-HCV in 11[6.6%; 95%CI (3.4-11.5%)]. In the logistic regression analysis, male sex, and age ≥40 years were independent factors associated with the occurrence of anti-HBc. In conclusion, we verified a high frequency of HBV contact marker and a low frequency of HCV markers in patients with HIV/AIDS and TB in Recife."
8847,0.004,4.0,Recent studies have suggested that host genetics may be useful for predicting drug response and have supported the recommendation that single polynucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL28B should be investigated when treating hepatitis C virus (HCV)-1 infected patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether a single IL-28B genotype SNP rs8099917 or rs12979860 determination is sufficient to predict treatment failure in patients with chronic HCV.
4469,0.004,4.0,"Hospital infection control measures are crucial to tuberculosis (TB) control strategies within settings caring for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, as these patients are at heightened risk of developing TB. Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a potent drug that effectively sterilizes persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. However, PZA resistance associated with mutations in the nicotinamidase/pyrazinamidase coding gene, pncA, is increasing. A total of 794 patient isolates obtained from four sites in Lima, Peru, underwent spoligotyping and drug resistance testing. In one of these sites, the HIV unit of Hospital Dos de Mayo (HDM), an isolation ward for HIV/TB coinfected patients opened during the study as an infection control intervention: circulating genotypes and drug resistance pre- and postintervention were compared. All other sites cared for HIV-negative outpatients: genotypes and drug resistance rates from these sites were compared with those from HDM. HDM patients showed high concordance between multidrug resistance, PZA resistance according to the Wayne method, the two most common genotypes (spoligotype international type [SIT] 42 of the Latino American-Mediterranean (LAM)-9 clade and SIT 53 of the T1 clade), and the two most common pncA mutations (G145A and A403C). These associations were absent among community isolates. The infection control intervention was associated with 58-92% reductions in TB caused by SIT 42 or SIT 53 genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 0.420, P = 0.003); multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 0.349, P < 0.001); and PZA-resistant TB (OR = 0.076, P < 0.001). In conclusion, pncA mutation typing, with resistance testing and spoligotyping, was useful in identifying a nosocomial TB outbreak and demonstrating its resolution after implementation of infection control measures."
3524,0.004,4.0,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified host genetic variation to be critical for predicting treatment response and spontaneous clearance in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). These important new studies are reviewed and their future clinical implications discussed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the region of the IL28B gene on chromosome 19, coding for the interferon (IFN)-λ-3 or IL28B gene, are strongly associated with treatment response to pegylated IFN and ribavirin in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. The good response variant is associated with a twofold increase in the rate of cure. Allele frequencies differ between ethnic groups, largely explaining the observed differences in response rates between Caucasians, African Americans and Asians. IL28B polymorphism is also strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. The biological mechanisms responsible for these genetic associations remain unknown and are the focus of ongoing research. Knowledge of a patient's IL28B genotype is likely to aid in clinical decision making with standard of care regimens. Future studies will investigate the possibility of individualizing treatment duration and novel regimens according to IL28B type."
1501,0.004,4.0,"Administering and monitoring therapy is crucial to the battle against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Electronic medical records (EMRs) can aid in documenting care, monitoring drug adherence and response to therapy, and providing data for quality improvement and research. Faculty at Moi University in Kenya and Indiana and University in the USA opened adult and pediatric HIV clinics in a national referral hospital, a district hospital, and six rural health centers in western Kenya using a newly developed EMR to support comprehensive outpatient HIV/AIDS care. Demographic, clinical, and HIV risk data, diagnostic test results, and treatment information are recorded on paper encounter forms and hand-entered into a central database that prints summary flowsheets and reminders for appropriate testing and treatment. There are separate modules for monitoring the Antenatal Clinic and Pharmacy. The EMR was designed with input from clinicians who understand the local community and constraints of providing care in resource poor settings. To date, the EMR contains more than 30,000 visit records for more than 4000 patients, almost half taking antiretroviral drugs. We describe the development and structure of this EMR and plans for future development that include wireless connections, tablet computers, and migration to a Web-based platform."
9930,0.004,4.0,"Protection of older persons, particularly those with diabetes, against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is of growing concern because of increased reports of outbreaks among long-term care facility residents receiving assisted blood glucose monitoring. We evaluated hepatitis B vaccine immunogenicity among residents immunized in response to two such outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities during June 2009-July 2010. One hundred forty-eight (71%) of 209 residents were found to be susceptible to HBV infection. Of 105 patients who began a vaccination series with Twinrix(®) (0-, 1-, 6-month dosing), 86 (82%) completed the series and postvaccination testing. Of these, most were elderly (median age 79.5 years; range 45-101), female (56%), and African-American (51%). Twenty-nine (34%) vaccinated residents had post-vaccination hepatitis B surface antibody levels ≥10 mIU/ml. There were no significant differences in vaccine response by age, gender, race, diabetes status, body mass index, or current smoking status. Our findings indicate that a low proportion of skilled nursing facility residents achieved a seroprotective response after hepatitis B vaccination."
669,0.004,4.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common opportunistic infection worldwide in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Intraabdominal TB includes lymphadenopathy and focal lesions of solid viscera. Symptomatic expression of tuberculous invasion of the pancreas (supplemented by demonstration of a mass on imaging) is rare among HIV-infected patients. We report the case of an HIV-infected patient with a tuberculous pancreatic abscess and review nine similar cases. All patients presented with persistent fever and abdominal pain. The diagnosis was made on the basis of detection of pancreatic mass lesions on computed tomographic (CT) scans and the results of cultures and/or acid-fast stains of peripancreatic abscess material and/or other body fluids. Despite an excellent response to antituberculous therapy, three patients died of unrelated causes. In the setting of a febrile illness with abdominal symptoms, tuberculous pancreatic abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis for HIV-infected patients with a CT-identified mass lesion."
9590,0.004,4.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) drug toxicities pose treatment challenges and contribute to poor adherence. This study was carried out to document the commonly reported adverse reactions caused by ARV drugs in HIV patients in Tanzania. Information on drug induced adverse reactions (ADRs) in patients using ARV drugs was collected from the databases maintained in HIV clinics of Dar es Salaam and Mbeya. A total of 7502 and 1234 records of patients under ARV therapy by December 2006 were analysed in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, respectively. In May, 2008 a cross-sectional study was conducted in which, the association between nevirapine (NVP) plasma concentrations and skin rashes problems was determined in 50 patients put on NVP based HAART for less than 2 weeks. Determination of NVP plasma concentration was carried out using a validated HPLC method in which patients from Dar es Salaam were involved. The study revealed that, anaemia, liver toxicity, skin rash and peripheral neuropathy were the most reported ADRs. The NVP plasma level determination revealed that there was no difference between those who had experienced skin rashes and those who did not (mean of 6.05 and 5.5 microg/ml respectively). There was a slight increase in reported ADRs between 2005 and 2006. A total of 932 (12.4%) patients changed their regimen in Dar es Salaam between January 2005 and December, 2006. Similarly, a total of 542 (44%) patients in Mbeya changed their regimen during that period. It can be concluded that, in both Dar es Salaam and Mbeya patients developed ARV related ADRs which are similar to those reported elsewhere."
496,0.004,4.0,"Hospital charts were reviewed to ascertain the frequency with which patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) were being managed in accordance with current guidelines or recommendations in New York State for the calendar year 1993. Comparisons were made between hospitals that are designated by the New York State Department of Health as comprehensive treatment centers--designated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) centers--and all other hospitals. For patients who had been on PCP prophylaxis before admission, 34% had documentation of positive histologic evidence for PCP infection during the studied hospitalization period. Of all patients not on PCP prophylaxis at the time of admission, 94% had at least one of the diagnostic tests for PCP done during the PCP hospitalization. Eighty-one percent of all patients had either pulse oximetry or an arterial blood gas determination. Seventy-seven percent of all patients with a PO2 equal to or less than 70 mm Hg received steroids. All eligible patients received one of nine possible treatment combinations, which included either single drug therapy, multiple drug therapy, or participation in a clinical trial. Sixteen percent of eligible patients had no documentation of receiving PCP medication at discharge. Proportions receiving diagnostic or treatment interventions were usually higher in designated AIDS centers than in non-designated AIDS centers."
3183,0.004,4.0,"In 2004, KwaZulu-Natal initiated one of the world's largest HIV/AIDS treatment programs. Studies in South Africa have shown that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop rapidly and transmit drug resistant mutations. Since resistance testing is not widely available in Kwazulu-Natal, the Department of Health conducted the first HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) threshold survey in 2005, which did not identify any mutations associated with HIVDR. The objective of this study was to conduct a follow-up threshold survey to update the information on HIVDR. This study was conducted in 2009 in five antenatal care sites in Kwazulu-Natal using the HIVDR threshold survey method developed by WHO. Two hundred and thirteen newly-diagnosed HIV positive, drug-naïve primigravidae, less than 22 years of age were included in the survey. Of the 82 HIV positive specimens, 17 had insufficient volume for genotyping and, of the remaining 65, 47 were genotyped sequentially. Drug resistance was identified by sequencing the HIV-1 pol gene, using the ViroSeq® HIV-1 genotyping system v2.0. Of the 47 samples that were genotyped, only one presented with a K103N mutation, which equates to a prevalence of transmitted HIVDR of <5%. The low prevalence of transmitted HIVDR is in keeping with statistical models of the early stages of ART rollout. As ART coverage is increasing continuously, there is a need to ensure that vigilance of HIVDR continues so that the emergence and spread of HIVDR is minimized."
4011,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains the most common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Efficient suppression of HBV viremia and necroinflammation as a result of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment is able to reduce HCC incidence; nevertheless, hepatocarcinogenesis can occur in the absence of active hepatitis, correlating with high HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) levels. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a central player in chronic inflammation and HCC development. However, in the absence of severe chronic inflammation, the role of NF-κB signaling in HCC development remains elusive. As a model of hepatocarcinogenesis driven by accumulation of HBV envelope polypeptides, HBsAg transgenic mice, which show no HBV-specific immune response, were crossed to animals with hepatocyte-specific inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling. We detected prolonged, severe endoplasmic reticulum stress already at 20 weeks of age in NF-κB-deficient hepatocytes of HBsAg-expressing mice. The unfolded protein response regulator binding immunoglobulin protein/78-kDa glucose-regulated protein was down-regulated, activating transcription factor 6, and eIF2α were activated with subsequent overexpression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. Notably, immune cell infiltrates and liver transaminases were unchanged. However, as a result of this increased cellular stress, insufficient hepatocyte proliferation due to G1 /S-phase cell cycle arrest with overexpression of p27 and emergence of ductular reactions was detected. This culminated in increased DNA damage already at 20 weeks of age and finally led to 100% HCC incidence due to NF-κB inhibition."
6689,0.004,4.0,"One of the hallmarks of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is the decline in CD4+ T lymphocytes which precedes the progression from an asymptomatic state to AIDS. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is one of the mechanisms proposed to mediate this depletion. Infectious and inactivated preparations of HIV-1LAI were compared for their potential to induce apoptosis. Analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting using the DNA intercalative compound propidium iodide demonstrated that apoptosis occurred only with infectious HIV-1, implying that cell surface binding and signalling by the virus alone were insufficient to trigger apoptosis. Apoptosis was further confirmed by the presence of characteristic digestion of host cell DNA and morphologically by nuclear condensation observed by transmission electron microscopy. HIV infection of CD4+ T cell lines generated an accumulation of the cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle and cells undergoing apoptosis appeared to originate from the pool of cells in the G1 phase. Inhibitors of HIV replication were used to identify the point in the virus replicative cycle at which apoptosis is induced. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, ddI, or the HIV protease inhibitor, RO31-8959 (Saquinavir), were added either 2 h before or 6 h after HIV inoculation. Only ddI inhibited HIV-induced apoptosis when added before inoculation; however, neither treatment was effective in preventing HIV-induced apoptosis when applied 6 h after inoculation. These data indicate that apoptosis requires a single round of reverse transcription and the expression of virion proteins, but not the maturation of progeny virions. Two agents which compete with HIV for binding to CD4+ T cells, dextran sulphate and the anti-CD4 MAb Leu3a, were effective at preventing apoptosis when added 6 h after infection, implying that a subsequent gp120-CD4 interaction at the surface of an infected cell was required to complete the apoptotic process."
4158,0.004,4.0,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."
7166,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study is to examine whether internalized AIDS stigma among HIV patients one year after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with sociodemographic characteristics, health status, social support, quality of life (QoL), and ARV adherence. This is a prospective study of all treatment-naive patients (N=735) recruited from all three public hospitals in Uthukela health district in KwaZulu-Natal and followed up at 6 and 12 months being on ART. Results indicated that despite a decrease in stigma seen in this study (may be due to ART) the level of stigma and discrimination remains high, and stigma reduction interventions are urgently needed in this population. CD4 cell counts significantly increased and HIV symptoms reduced significantly but depression symptoms remained high and even increased after 12 months on treatment. In multivariate analysis lower CD4 cell counts (odds ratio 0.5, 0.3-0.9), severe depression (5.6, 2.5-12.5) and low QoL (0.6, 0.5-0.8) were associated with internalized AIDS stigma. These findings may suggest that HIV care should include counseling and support that includes stigma concerns, depression, and QoL prior to and during the first year following diagnosis."
3741,0.004,4.0,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in cancer incidence, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, which arises from hepatocytes and accounts for approximately 70%-85% of cases. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) frequently causes liver inflammation, hepatic damage and subsequent cirrhosis. Integrated viral DNA is found in 85%-90% of HBV-related HCCs. Its presence in tumors from non-cirrhotic livers of children or young adults further supports the role of viral DNA integration in hepatocarcinogenesis. Integration of subgenomic HBV DNA fragments into different locations within the host DNA is a significant feature of chronic HBV infection. Integration has two potential consequences: (1) the host genome becomes altered (""cis"" effect); and (2) the HBV genome becomes altered (""trans"" effect). The cis effect includes insertional mutagenesis, which can potentially disrupt host gene function or alter host gene regulation. Tumor progression is frequently associated with rearrangement and partial gain or loss of both viral and host sequences. However, the role of integrated HBV DNA in hepatocarcinogenesis remains controversial. Modern technology has provided a new paradigm to further our understanding of disease mechanisms. This review summarizes the role of HBV DNA integration in human carcinogenesis."
4921,0.004,4.0,"The antiretroviral drug combination emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) taken as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective in preventing HIV infection, yet it also requires adherence and potentially decreases condom use. This study sought to examine these issues among a key population at risk of HIV infection, substance-using men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted semi-structured interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 30 young (aged 20-35) MSM prescribed PrEP within a large integrated healthcare system in San Francisco, who had reported recent drug use or hazardous drinking and one or more missed doses of PrEP. We explored participants' risk perception and sexual risk behavior, drug and alcohol use, and PrEP adherence in the context of substance use. Interviews were transcribed and coded using a directed content analysis approach to identify key categories and commonalities, and differences across participants. Salient subcategories included positive psychological effects of being on PrEP (e.g., decreased anxiety, feelings of empowerment), social effects (e.g., reduced HIV stigma), and reduction in overall perceptions of HIV risk. While overall reported use of condoms went down and many reported a brief period of increased condomless sex following PrEP initiation, others continued condom use with most of their sexual partners. Contextual factors influencing their decision to engage in condomless sex included how well they knew the partner and whether the partner was on PrEP or HIV antiretroviral treatment. Factors associated with poor adherence included disruptions in daily routine and use of alcohol and methamphetamine. PrEP-prescribing clinicians should support their patients in making informed decisions about condom use and identifying strategies to maximize adherence in the context of substance use."
1560,0.004,4.0,"Clinically significant methemoglobinemia can develop as a result of medications. Although dapsone and primaquine are known to produce methemoglobinemia in susceptible individuals, methemoglobinemia has been reported only rarely in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population. We describe five cases of methemoglobinemia caused by either primaquine or dapsone alone or in combination. The initial methemoglobin level ranged from 15.3% in the patient whose methemoglobinemia was caused by primaquine alone to 33.1%. Five patients developed symptomatic methemoglobinemia requiring hospitalization for 1 to 12 days. Two cases resulted from intentional overdoses of dapsone, and three developed within several days of commencing primaquine while dapsone remained present in the bloodstream. The four severe cases required intravenous methylene blue, supplemental oxygen, plus erythrocyte transfusions, whereas the mild case responded to oxygen therapy plus discontinuation of the precipitating drugs. Blood gases and pulse oximetry do not aid in the diagnosis, which requires cooximetry. Our study indicates that dapsone and primaquine alone or in combination can produce clinically significant methemoglobinemia in HIV-infected individuals, either in the setting of an overdose or when primaquine is instituted before dapsone has been cleared from the bloodstream."
5703,0.004,4.0,"With ongoing earlier enrollment on and rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, there are increasing risks of transmitted HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) at population levels. We, therefore, evaluated the threshold of HIVDR in a population initiating ART, to inform on the effectiveness of first-line regimens, considering HIV-1 diversity, plasma viral load (PVL), and CD4-based disease progression. A total of 53 adults [median (interquartile range, IQR) CD4: 162 cell/mm(3) (48-284); median (IQR) PVL: 5.34 log10 RNA (4.17-6.42) copies/ml] initiating ART in 2014 at the Yaoundé Central Hospital were enrolled for HIV-1 protease-reverse transcriptase sequencing. Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) were interpreted using the 2009 World Health Organization (WHO) list versus the Stanford HIVdb algorithm version 7.0. Level of DRMs was low (3.77%) versus moderate (7.55%), respectively, following the WHO list (T69D, K103N) versus Stanford HIVdb (T69D, A98G, K103N, K238T), respectively. Prevailing clade was CRF02_AG (71.70%). Based on Stanford HIVdb, a slightly higher proportion of patients with DRMs were found among ones infected with CRF02_AG than in those non-CRF02_AG infected (7.89% vs. 6.67%, p = 1.000), with lower PVL (7.69% <5.5 vs. 0% ≥5.5 log10 RNA copies/ml, p = .488) and with higher CD4 counts (9.52% CD4 ≥200 vs. 3.33% CD4 <200 cells/mm(3), p = .749). Thresholds of DRMs suggest that standard first-line regimens currently used in Cameroon may remain effective at population levels, despite scale-up of ART in the country, pending adherence, and closed virological monitoring. With an intent-to-diagnose approach, the discrepant levels of DRMs support using Stanford HIVdb to evaluate initial ART, while revising the WHO list for surveillance."
1622,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, the Pacific, and particularly Asia, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic, the most common route of transmission is perinatal. To minimize the number of horizontal transmissions, we determined the prevalence of HBV genotypes among children in northern Thailand. From a survey of 1,231 schoolchildren in Chiang Mai during 1998 to 2000, 55 (4.5%) were found positive for HBsAg. Fifty-three HBsAg-positive samples were available for this study. These came from 28 girls (52.8%) and 25 boys (47.2%), age 5-16 years, with a mean age of 12.8 (+/-2.6) years. The laboratory method was based on a multiplex-PCR for the detection of 6 HBV genotypes (A-F). Among 53 HBsAg positive cases, 48 (90.6%) were genotype C, followed by 4 cases of genotype B (7.5%), and 1 case (1.9%) with mixed infection with genotypes B and C. The high prevalence of HBV genotype C follow by genotype B is similar to that found among blood donors in northern Thailand and the nationwide epidemiological survey conducted in 2004. Perinatal transmission may play an important role in the spread of the virus in this area, as in other Asian countries, where genotypes C and B are highly prevalent."
464,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem, with more than 350 million people chronically infected worldwide. The chronic HBV infection in Poland is also an essential medical and social problem. Starting from 1993, a steady decline of the incidence of HBV has been observed, reaching the estimated rate of 4.5 per 100 000 in 2004. Nothing is known about the genetic variability of HBV in Poland, the occurrence and spreading of genetic variants and mutants of hepatitis B virus in the population of Polish patients during the course of the disease and in relation to antiviral treatment. It is very interesting to study the molecular epidemiology of the Polish population regarding hepatitis B virus infection as Poland is still ethnically a uniform country, with no more than 3-4% of ethnic minorities. The first results regarding distribution of HBV genotypes and serotypes in northern Poland have been published by our group in 2003 and 2004. This work was part of a scientific project supported by the Fifth Framework Programme initiative of the European Union, entitled ""Emerging variants of hepatitis B virus: new tools for epidemiological survey, diagnosis of infection, and monitoring of drug resistance"". In the course of the project more than 200 hepatitis B infected patients from the northern part of Poland have been enrolled, diagnosed and - if the viral load of HBV was suitable for analysis - genotyped by sequencing of the HBV pol/S gene fragment. This review presents the main characteristics and some interesting aspects of the studied cohort of chronically infected patients from northern Poland as well as the molecular epidemiology."

Between 1985, when most patients were tested for HIV infection, and 1993 3 possibly HIV-related suicides were reported to Haemophilia Centre Directors. It is argued that haemophilia comprehensive care may contribute to reducing some of the factors associated with suicide risk, and thus be a reason for this low incidence. It is suggested that the pattern of health care delivery developed for the haemophilia community might serve as a template for those treating others with HIV infection."
9867,0.004,4.0,"Medicaid is rapidly moving toward managed care throughout the United States and will have a major impact on care programs for those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The experience at the Johns Hopkins HIV Care Service is an example of the transition from fee-for-service to managed care. The Maryland Medicaid program, which has required enrollment of all Medicaid recipients since June 1997, uses an adjusted payment rate and separately funds protease inhibitors. Elements that made the transition to a managed care organization possible included the early development of a comprehensive network of services and a database showing that historical Medicaid payments were low compared with the statewide experience. Our Medicaid managed care program promotes unlimited access to specialists, rejects the ""gatekeeper"" concept for any service, and includes an open formulary. Nevertheless, it is uncertain that the services now provided can be sustained with anticipated reductions in payments that seem inevitable with Medicaid policies here and nationally."
4758,0.004,4.0,"The effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of HIV infection is usually measured by survival, CD4 lymphocyte counts, HIV-1 RNA viral load testing, and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This pilot study sought to measure the impact of HAART treatments on a wide range of clinical outcomes and psychological variables in a sample of patients with advanced HIV infection. Seventy patients with advanced AIDS who were protease inhibitor naïve were started on HAART regimens. Patients were admitted to an AIDS inpatient unit of a long-term care facility that provides treatment and palliative care. All patients were diagnosed with AIDS, had CD4 cell counts below 300/cc(3), and had a projected survival of greater than one month. Patients were started on triple-drug HAART regimens with daily medical supervision and observation. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory markers, a series of observer-rated and self-report instruments were used to measure various physical and psychological factors (e.g., pain and symptom distress, psychological well-being, depression). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 3 months of HAART therapy. As expected, the CD4 count increased and viral load levels decreased significantly over the 3-month study period. In addition, patients improved significantly in body weight, and serum albumin and ferritin levels. The only psychosocial measure that improved significantly with treatment was depression. Ratings of pain intensity, physical and psychological symptom distress, and overall quality of life did not change. Of the 70 patients studied, 84.3% were still alive after the 3-month study period. Of these, 6 (8.6%) were discharged to community. However, 17 surviving patients (24.3%) had HAART regimens discontinued due to drug intolerance and 11 patients (15.7%) expired during the study period. While these data are preliminary, HAART regimens appear to have positive effects on CD4 count, HIV viral load, and several other measures of physical well-being in patients with advanced AIDS. Despite these improvements, the benefits of treatment on pain and symptom distress, and psychological well-being were less clear. In addition, treatment failure (mortality and intolerance) were not uncommon in this sample (40%). Further research is clearly necessary to better understand the benefits of HAART therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection."
7791,0.004,4.0,"Depletion of CD4+ T cells is one of the hallmarks of progression of HIV-1 infection. However, measurement of the CD4+ T-cell count is expensive and often unavailable in less developed areas. Previous studies have suggested that the total lymphocyte count (TLC) can be used to predict a low absolute CD4+ T-cell count. To determine the relationship between TLC and CD4+ T-cell count in HIV-1-infected South African patients, 2777 HIV-1-seropositive patients visiting the Immunology clinic at the Pelonomi Hospital in Bloemfontein, South Africa from April 1991 to April 1997 were included in the study. In total, 3237 observations were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, of various cutpoints of the TLC to predict an absolute CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, CD4+ percentage <20%, and CD4+ percentage <15%. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between TLC and CD4+ T cells, CD4+ percentage and CD8+ T cells, as well as between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Results demonstrated that a TLC of 2 x 10(9)/L or less had a sensitivity of 90.3% to detect patients with a CD4+ T-cell count of <200 cells/mm3, but a specificity of only 53.7%. When the TLC cutoff value was lowered, specificity increased but sensitivity decreased. For the observations as a group, a correlation (r = 0.704) between CD4+ T-cell count and TLC was demonstrated, but if the patients were divided into three groups according to their CD4+ T-cell count, this correlation weakened considerably. Therefore, although TLC shows a correlation with CD4+ T-cell count, it is not a good predictor of the CD4+ T-cell count in this population and should preferably not be used in the clinical care of HIV/AIDS patients."
1888,0.004,4.0,"The regulation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection and replication in primary monocytes was investigated by mutagenesis of recombinant proviral clones containing an env determinant required for the infectivity of monocytes. Virus replication was assayed by determination of reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids and by recovery of virus from monocytes following cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, silent infection, and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or vpu genes generated lower replication levels in monocytes. Mutation of both vpr and vpu, however, resulted in nearly complete attenuation of virus replication in monocytes, despite subsequent virus recovery from infected monocytes by cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (silent infection). These findings indicate a central role for the ""accessory"" genes vpu and vpr in productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in monocytes and indicate that vpu and vpr may be capable of functional complementation."
71,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is currently about 35% among injecting drug users in Budapest, Hungary, and it is under 20% outside of the capital, and no verified case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been detected so far. Mathematical models describe that the co-occurrence of HIV and HCV among injecting drug users is such under an HCV prevalence of about 35% the probability of an HIV epidemic is low, but above this threshold an, HIV epidemic is to be expected. According to these models, there is a looming probability of an HIV epidemic among injecting drug users in Hungary, especially in Budapest. There are four ways to prevent or delay such an epidemic: 1. substitution treatment programs; 2. legal access to injecting equipment; 3. free and confidential HIV and HCV counseling and rapid testing; and 4. hygienic injecting environment. In order to avoid a predicted HIV epidemic, epidemiological pattern of HCV among injecting drug users in Hungary requires both a comprehensive prevention response and the systematic monitoring of the epidemiological situation. The success of the prevention programs depends on two factors: 1. wide access; and 2. regular financial support from the government."
8860,0.004,4.0,"Increased access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by human immunodeficiency virus postive (HIV⁺) individuals has become a reality worldwide. In Brazil, HAART currently reaches over half of HIV-infected subjects. In the context of a remarkable HIV-1 genetic variability, highly related variants, called quasispecies, are generated. HIV quasispecies generated during infection can influence virus persistence and pathogenicity, representing a challenge to treatment. However, the clinical relevance of minority quasispecies is still uncertain. In this study, we have determined the archived proviral sequences, viral subtype and drug resistance mutations from a cohort of HIV⁺ patients with undetectable viral load undergoing HAART as first-line therapy using next-generation sequencing for near full-length virus genome (NFLG) assembly. HIV-1 consensus sequences representing NFLG were obtained for eleven patients, while for another twelve varying genome coverage rates were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis showed the predominance of subtype B (83%; 19/23). Considering the minority variants, 18 patients carried archived virus harboring at least one mutation conferring antiretroviral resistance; for six patients, the mutations correlated with the current ARVs used. These data highlight the importance of monitoring HIV minority drug resistant variants and their clinical impact, to guide future regimen switches and improve HIV treatment success."
4258,0.004,4.0,"The aim of this study performed in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, was to describe the distribution of CD4+ T-cell lymphocytes (CD4) in HIV-1-infected (HIV+) pregnant women diagnosed during prenatal voluntary counseling and testing and to assess whether HIV-related immunodeficiency influenced the acceptance of an antiretroviral (ARV) package (zidovudine beginning at 36 weeks of amenorrhea plus intrapartum nevirapine) to prevent mother-to-child transmission. Between April and June 2002, a CD4 count was systematically performed in all HIV+ women (n=221) in 5 antenatal clinics carrying out voluntary counseling and testing. No difference in CD4 count was found in HIV+ women who did not return for their test result (n=50) and those who were informed of their positive serostatus (n=171) (median CD4 count: 389/mm3 vs. 420/mm3; P=0.19). We also found a lack of difference in CD4 count in those who accepted ARV (n=72) and those who did not but knew their HIV status (n=99) (median CD4 count: 405/mm3 vs. 425/mm3; P=0.47). The overall uptake of the intervention (31.9%) appeared to be independent of the maternal immune status."
1793,0.004,4.0,"Hematologic manifestations in perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected children have not been widely described in literature. Knowledge of the spontaneous evolution of this disease is essential for achieving optimum care of patients. We analyzed the main hematologic manifestations developed in the prehighly active antiretroviral therapy period of 1217 children, collected from the Italian Register for HIV infection. In 111 patients, the hematologic sign was the first clinical manifestation. Among anemic and neutropenic patients, the fraction of patients in clinical class C was significantly higher than the corresponding fraction in class B (76%, P<0.001 and 74%, P<0.01), and significantly lower in thrombocytopenic patients (42%, P<0.001). The overall progression from class B to C was overlapping to the control group; when separated, however, anemic patients progressed faster (P<0.0001), whereas thrombocytopenic patients had a slower progression, similar to the nonhematologic patients in class A. Anemic patients had a worse prognosis than the control group (P<0.0001), similar to the nonhematologic patients in class C. Finally, the negative prognostic value of anemia was independent from the immunologic condition. Anemia was associated with greater mortality risks. Thrombocytopenia appeared, paradoxically, to be a positive prognostic factor within class B. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification presently defines hematologic patients as a single entity; a finer distinction could improve its relevance for the rational design of prevention and therapy."

Major problems facing surgeons will be how and when to provide appropriate care for AIDS patients, and protection of themselves and all health care personnel from occupational infection by the highly lethal HIV. Strict adherence to guidelines to prevent such occupational infection is paramount, and these should be observed in all patients, since it is impossible to always identify patients who are infectious. A sound understanding of the clinical problem and attention to this evolving epidemic are also essential for surgeons and all other health care personnel. With respect to society in general, control of AIDS and HIV can only be achieved by a joint effort of education, individual responsibility, and a coordinated governmental commitment to the problem."

9989,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global public health challenge, with an estimated 1.4 million patients worldwide. Co-infection with HIV leads to challenges in both the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Further, there has been an increase in rates of drug resistant tuberculosis, including multi-drug (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDRTB), which are difficult to treat and contribute to increased mortality. Because of the poor performance of sputum smear microscopy in HIV-infected patients, newer diagnostic tests are urgently required that are not only sensitive and specific but easy to use in remote and resource-constrained settings. The treatment of co-infected patients requires antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs to be administered concomitantly; challenges include pill burden and patient compliance, drug interactions, overlapping toxic effects, and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Also important questions about the duration and schedule of anti-TB drug regimens and timing of antiretroviral therapy remain unanswered. From a programmatic point of view, screening of all HIV-infected persons for TB and vice-versa requires good co-ordination and communication between the TB and AIDS control programmes. Linkage of co-infected patients to antiretroviral treatment centres is critical if early mortality is to be prevented. We present here an overview of existing diagnostic strategies, new tests in the pipeline and recommendations for treatment of patients with HIV-TB dual infection."
6574,0.004,4.0,"HIV and poor mental health are intricately related. In settings of poverty, both are often rooted in structural factors related to material and social deprivation. We performed a qualitative analysis to understand factors contributing to poor emotional health and its impact among impoverished Peruvian HIV-infected individuals. We conducted focus group discussions with patients and providers consisting of semistructured, open-ended questions. Qualitative analysis provided insight into the profound impact of depression, isolation, stigma, and lack of social support among these patients. Living with HIV contributed significantly to mental health problems experienced by HIV-positive individuals; furthermore, long-standing stressors-such as economic hardship, fragmented family relationships, and substance use-shaped patients' outlooks, and may have contributed not only to current emotional hardship but to risk factors for contracting HIV as well. Once diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, many patients experienced hopelessness, stigma, and socioeconomic marginalization. Patients tended to rely on informal sources of support, including peers and community health workers, and rarely used formal mental health services. In resource-poor settings, the context of mental health problems among HIV-positive individuals must be framed within the larger structural context of poverty and social exclusion. Optimal strategies to address the mental health problems of these individuals should include integrating mental health services into HIV care, task shifting to utilize community health workers where human resources are scarce, and interventions aimed at poverty alleviation."
6473,0.004,4.0,"Starting from the observation that a number of consecutive patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) resulted positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies on routine testing, we set up a survey for HCV contact prevalence in all patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) followed in our institution. We searched for HCV antibodies by a third-generation ELISA technique, followed by a confirmation test (RIBA III); serum viral RNA and HCV genotype were investigated by a RT-PCR technique. We screened a total of 315 patients suffering from B-NHL (91), multiple myeloma (56), MGUS (48), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (57), Waldentrom's macroglobulinemia (13), Hodgkin's disease (HD)(43), and T-NHL (9). While only 1 of 52 patients with a non-B-LPD (HD or T-NHL) had signs of HCV contact (i.e., 1.9%, which is in the range of the normal population in the South of Italy), 59 of 263 patients with a B-LPD (22.4%) had HCV antibodies or RNA, or both, with no major differences among the various types of disorders, except for WM, in which the rate was higher (61.5%). The same prevalence was found for patients tested at diagnosis or during the follow-up, and in transfused or never-transfused patients. Only a few patients were aware of having a liver disease; one-half of HCV-positive patients never had transaminase increase. A review of data from Central and Northern Italy is included, showing similar findings; a report from Japan has confirmed such an association, while limited surveys in England have not revealed any correlation. These findings may have important biological and clinical implications."
7032,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog-based regimens remain an integral component of combination therapy for use in both antiretroviral treatment-naive and experienced HIV-infected patients. To further define treatment responses to new antiretroviral therapy in patients with long-term experience to dual nucleoside analog therapy (zidovudine [ZDV] plus didanosine [ddI] or ZDV plus zalcitabine [ddC]), 325 subjects derived from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) 175 trial were randomized to three different combination regimens: (1) continuation of ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (continuation arm), (2) addition of 3TC to ZDV + ddI or ZDV + ddC (addition arm), or (3) a switch to ZDV + 3TC therapy (switch arm). Both the addition and switch arms sustained significantly greater short-term (baseline to week 4) mean CD4+ cell count increases compared with the continuation arm (+36, +28 versus -4 cells/mm3; p = 0.012) and long-term CD4+ cell count responses (baseline to weeks 40/48: +32, +19 versus -9 cells/mm3; p = 0.003). Superior short-term (baseline to week 8) mean decreases in plasma HIV RNA (p < 0.001) were achieved by both the addition and switch arms (0.53 log10 and 0.54 log10 copies/ml, respectively) compared with the continuation arm (0.13 copies/ml) whereas no differences in long-term virologic suppression were observed (p = 0.30). At week 48, no differences were observed in the proportions of subjects who had HIV RNA levels below 500 copies/mL: 18% of subjects in each treatment arm (3-way p = 1.0). Overall, the treatments were well tolerated and only nine subjects (3%) died or developed one or more AIDS-defining events. While this study confirms the intrinsic antiretroviral activity of 3TC, only modest marker changes and limited short-term viral suppression are seen with incremental addition of the drug. The current approach of using 3TC in maximally suppressive regimens is preferred."

GP73 was evaluated as a biomarker of HIV progression and AIDS treatment efficacy. Forty-eight HIV patients (≤ 350 CD4 + T cells/μL) undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART group) and 18 HIV patients expected to undergo HAART within 9 months (>350 CD4 + T cells/μL) (control group) were enrolled in a prospective, single center, cohort study from May 2009 to Jun 2012. Blood aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholesterol, triglycerides, and total bilirubin were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (HAART group) or 3 month intervals (control group). Serum HIV RNA level (viral load) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) GP73 concentration were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay kit and western blot, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations in baseline serum GP73 concentration and HIV viral load (r = 0.39, P < 0.001) and CD4 + T cell count (r = -0.501, P < 0.001) were observed, respectively. In receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 (95 % CI 0.66-0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of GP73 for correct identification of patients with ≤350 CD4 + T cells/μL were 76.09 and 75.0 %, respectively, with an ROC-derived cut-off of 100.6 ng/mL. For HIV patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, GP73 may be a potential biomarker treatment efficacy useful in AIDS management."
6790,0.004,4.0,"There is little information on infections caused by larval cestodes in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in developed countries. Two infections by larval cestodes were found in 714 HIV-infected patients studied from 1998 to 2004 at the Hospital General Universitario de Elche in Spain (Mediterranean Coast). The first patient was a Colombian immigrant diagnosed as having neurocysticercosis, and subsequently found to have HIV infection. The second case was an HIV-infected Spanish patient who developed hydatid disease of the liver, lung and peritoneum. Both patients died. Although infrequent, infections by larval cestodes constitute a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in developed countries, and might be linked with a more severe presentation."
9217,0.004,4.0,"Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy with indinavir plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is associated with greater reductions in viral load, greater increases in CD4+ cell counts, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared with 2 NRTIs alone. In the landmark clinical trial ACTG 320, the rate of progression to AIDS or death (primary end-point) among zidovudine-experienced patients treated with indinavir, zidovudine and lamivudine was approximately half that of patients who received only zidovudine plus lamivudine (6 vs 11%; p < 0.001). The durability of an indinavir-containing regimen was demonstrated in Merck protocol 035, an ongoing trial in which a significant proportion of patients had sustained viral suppression for up to 3 years. Merck protocol 039, also an ongoing trial, showed a greater effect on surrogate markers of HIV disease progression with indinavir-based triple therapy than with zidovudine plus lamivudine or indinavir monotherapy in patients with advanced disease (median baseline CD4+ count 15 cells/microL). Numerous additional clinical trials have established the beneficial antiviral and immunological effects of indinavir in both antiretroviral-naive and -experienced patients with HIV infection. Indinavir is associated with various drug class-related adverse events, including gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea), headache and asthenia/fatigue. A lipodystrophy syndrome has been commonly reported with indinavir and other protease inhibitors combined with NRTIs, but it has also been reported in many protease inhibitor-naive patients, and a definitive causal link has not been established between the syndrome and protease inhibitors. Nephrolithiasis may develop in about 9% of patients receiving indinavir but does not appear to be associated with other protease inhibitors; <0.5% of patients receiving indinavir discontinue the drug because of nephrolithiasis, which may be the extreme end of a continuum of crystal-related renal syndromes. Additional renal problems (e.g. nephropathy) have been reported in small numbers of patients receiving indinavir. In summary, indinavir is a protease inhibitor with well documented efficacy when used as part of combined therapy in patients with HIV infection. Both US and UK treatment guidelines continue to recommend protease inhibitor-based regimens including indinavir as a first-line option. Indinavir is being studied as a twice daily and once daily regimen with a low dosage of ritonavir as a way to alleviate tolerability, drug interaction and patient compliance/adherence issues. Indinavir-containing triple therapy has demonstrated positive effects not only on surrogate markers of disease progression, but also on clinical end-points of mortality and morbidity in patients with HIV disease. Protease inhibitors are a significant advance in the care of patients with HIV infection, and, in an era of evidence-based medicine, indinavir represents an important component of antiretroviral treatment strategies."
9344,0.004,4.0,"Nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including zidovudine, didanosine, and zalcitabine, remain the cornerstone of therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS. Although therapeutic regimens have been designed that are effective in slowing the progression of disease, therapy with these agents has not been optimized. Ultimately, therapy is destined to fail in most patients. Decisions regarding when to begin therapy and the course of action to take when failure of therapy occurs are largely in the hands of the patient's physician, and currently must be made without the support of conclusive clinical data. In addition to an understanding of the recommended dosing guidelines, proper management of AIDS therapy requires a fundamental knowledge of the disease process, the pharmacology and limitations of the agents employed against the virus, and close cooperation with the clinical laboratory. Therefore, this article reviews the pharmacology of the three drugs currently approved for treatment of HIV infection, and the current guidelines for their use. The article also reviews the clinical and laboratory management of these agents, including the use of surrogate markers and the potential for pharmacokinetic optimization of therapy."
3335,0.004,4.0,"To examine the genetic features of the long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from six HIV-1-infected individuals enrolled in the Mexico City Cohort, we cloned and sequenced a 505-bp fragment of the proviral LTR from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All patients harbored HIV-1 LTR quasispecies corresponding to the B subtype. Three patients with high CD4+ T cell counts (>500/mm3) presented LTR sequences with point mutations in the TAR bulge. The LTR sequence from a patient classified as a long-term nonprogressor (LTNP) presented the most frequent naturally occurring length polymorphism (MFNLP) and two substitutions in the TAR region that were predicted to result in two alternative secondary RNA structures. A novel 18-bp deletion, which eliminates part of the putative binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT-1), was identified in the overlapping nef/LTR sequence derived from a patient progressing to AIDS. This deletion coincides with the ability of this virus to consistently replicate at low levels in vivo (viral load <500 RNA copies/ml) and in vitro (unsuccessful virus isolation). On one occasion, when virus isolation was successful, the 18-bp deletion was no longer evident and LTR sequences with intact NFAT-1-binding sites were observed. Inoculation of hu-PBL-SCID mice with viruses from several Mexican patients resulted in differential CD4+ T cell depletion patterns 15 days postinfection, which agree with the in vivo CD4+ T cell count data from each patient."
7793,0.004,4.0,"Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend early initiation of HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) irrespective of their clinical or immunological status known as the test and start approach. Lesotho, like many other countries introduced this approach in 2016 as a strategy to reach epidemic control. There will be rapidly growing number of HIV-infected individuals initiating treatment leading to practical challenges on health systems such as congestion, long waiting time for patients and limited time to provide quality services to patients. Differentiated models of ART delivery is an innovative solution that helps to increase access to care, while reducing the burden on existing health systems. Ultimately this model will help to achieve retention and viral suppression. We describe a demonstration study designed to evaluate a community-based differentiated model of multi-month dispensing (MMD) approaches of ART among stable HIV patients in Lesotho."
7711,0.004,4.0,"The Early Intervention Program (EIP) is California's publicly funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care and treatment program with 30 sites throughout the state. Our objective for this study was to examine the number of days from first HIV-positive result until enrollment into EIP by race/ethnicity, behavioral risk, and other characteristics, with data from clients who enrolled in an EIP site after the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapies. For Model I, logistic regression distinguished clients diagnosed with HIV and enrolled in EIP on the same day (0 days) from those with values of 1+ days; linear regression was then used on the log transformation of days for the majority of clients not diagnosed and enrolled on the same day. For Model II, logistic regression was used to identify client characteristics related to enrollment in EIP over 6 weeks from the date of HIV diagnosis. We found that Latinos were more likely than whites to enroll in EIP on the day they were diagnosed with HIV. For clients not diagnosed and enrolled in EIP on the same day, no differences across racial and ethnic groups were found for days until enrollment in HIV care and treatment. However, clients with a history of injection drug use took longer from the day they were diagnosed with HIV to enroll in EIP. The California EIP represents a model for programs seeking equity in access to HIV care and treatment across racial and ethnic groups. Getting injectors into timely HIV care and treatment represents a challenge."
3529,0.004,4.0,"Prior to the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-infected patients were usually not considered as transplant candidates because of the poor prognosis of their underlying disease and concerns regarding the potential detrimental effects of immunosuppression on viral load and immune status. However, with the significant HAART-associated improvements in morbidity and mortality, good short-term outcomes after liver and kidney transplantation for patients with HIV infection have been reported. Nevertheless, HIV infection is currently considered a contraindication to lung transplantation in most transplant centers worldwide. The results of a double lung transplant performed in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) and end-stage respiratory failure (ESRF) are presented after a 2-year follow-up. Approval of and recommendations for the management of this patient were obtained from the Italian National Center for Transplantation as an extension of the ongoing Italian protocol for liver and kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals. The operation was successful and the patient recovered rapidly after surgery. A cautious infectious and immunosuppressive management allowed so far the avoidance of major infectious complications and rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of lung transplantation in an HIV and HBV co-infected patient."
8478,0.004,4.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001)."
274,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat, a nuclear transactivator of viral gene expression, has the unusual property of being released by infected cells. Recent studies suggest that extracellular Tat is partially sequestered by heparan sulfate proteoglycans. As a consequence, Tat is concentrated on the cell surface and protected from proteolytic degradation, thus remaining in a biologically active form. We show that Tat binds the surfaces of both HIV-1-infected and surrounding uninfected cells. We provide evidence for a specific interaction between Tat and the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) envelope protein, which enhances virus attachment and entry into cells. We map the interacting sites of both Tat and gp120 and show that synthetic peptides mimicking the gp120 site inhibit HIV-1 infection. Our data demonstrate that membrane-associated Tat is a novel modulator of virus entry and suggest that the Tat-gp120 interaction represents a critical step in HIV-1 spreading during the course of infection."

2608,0.004,4.0,"Both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are important global public health problems with shared transmission routes. Although HIV/HCV coinfection is not uncommon, the prevalence rates vary significantly across different studies and regions. In Taiwan, injection drug users have become the major contributors to the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 2005. Because the prevalence of HCV infection is high in injection drug users, this HIV epidemic is also associated with a significant increase of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan. To control Taiwan's HIV epidemic, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) launched a harm-reduction program in 2006. The HIV epidemic, the percentage attributed to injection drug users, and the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection gradually declined thereafter. In this article, we aimed to thoroughly examine the current literatures of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan and hope to provide a better understanding of the needs for the management of this coinfection. We conducted a narrative review and searched for literature from PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library database untill August 2015. Studies relevant to the epidemiology and associated risk factors of HIV/HCV coinfection in Taiwan were examined and discussed."

We reviewed 1510 records of patients treated for active TB at the Public Health - Seattle & King County Tuberculosis Control Program between 2000 and 2010, and identified 53 with HCI. Advanced age, being born in the USA, HIV infection, homelessness and injection drug use were independently associated with HCI in TB cases. Independent factors associated with increased treatment duration included HIV infection, excess alcohol use, extrapulmonary TB, and any drug-resistant TB disease. Our findings suggest that TB-HCI patients can be successfully treated for active TB without extending treatment duration."

Children under 10 years with cerebral malaria and/or severe malarial anaemia, were compared with children with symptomatic, mild malaria, and controls of the same age and ethnicity. Adult TB cases with smear-positive pulmonary TB were compared with healthy blood donors from the same ethnic groups. Malaria cases and controls were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and surface antigen (HBsAg). TB patients were tested for HIV antibodies. Genotyping used sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis to identify MBP variant alleles. Overall, 46% (944/2041) of patients and controls were homozygous for the wild-type MBP allele, 45% (922/2041) were carriers of a single variant allele and 8.6% (175/2041) had two variant alleles. Neither homozygotes nor heterozygotes for MBP variants were at increased risk of clinical malaria, persistent HBV carriage or TB. The most common mutation in Africans, the codon 57 variant allele, was weakly associated with resistance to TB (221/794 in TB cases and 276/844 in controls, p = 0.037). MBP deficiency is not a significant risk factor for persistent HBV, severe malaria nor pulmonary TB in West Africa."

Liver function tests and viral markers were monitored monthly. Liver biopsy was requested whenever the alanine transaminase (ALT) was persistently abnormal. Eighty-six HBV carriers who were not given anti-TB drugs were chosen as a second control and evaluated prospectively. The incidence of liver dysfunction was significantly higher in HBV carriers given anti-TB drugs (34.9%) when compared to noncarriers (9.4%, P <.001) and with HBV carriers not given anti-TB drugs (8.1%, P <.001). For patients given anti-TB drugs, HBV carriers who developed liver dysfunction were younger (P =.011) and had more severe liver injury compared with noncarriers (P =.008). By multiple logistic regression analysis, age (P =.002) and hepatitis B infection (P <.001) were the only 2 significant risk factors for hepatotoxicity related to anti-TB therapy."
335,0.004,4.0,"Since the use of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) for HIV infection, there have been increasing reports of systemic manifestations of immune restoration. This new clinical syndrome among HIV-infected patients is associated with underlying co-infections with mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C infections, etc.... We report on an HIV/tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patient who developed an immune restoration inflammatory syndrome after initiation of HAART and anti-TB treatment. She developed fever, large abscesses and pleural and peritoneal effusions. Systemic symptoms decreased during corticosteroid treatment, but abscesses only disappeared 8 months after the start of the anti-TB treatment."
1312,0.004,4.0,"As health-care services in Nigeria and other African countries are becoming overstrained with patients, home-based care has increasingly been touted as a possible solution. The faith-based organisation, Gospel Health and Development Services, provides a home-based care programme for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) residing in Plateau State, Nigeria. This paper assesses the challenges that PLWHA in the programme faced while maintaining their health and livelihoods. The frustrations that volunteers endured in performing their work are also described, as well as the benefits and weaknesses of the programme from the perspective of PLWHA and their volunteer caregivers. Focus groups and interviews were done with 30 PLWHA and 22 volunteers to learn about their experiences with the home-based care programme and possible areas for its improvement. From these discussions three major challenges facing PLWHA emerged: discrimination towards PLWHA; the lack of money, food, and transport to health-care centres; and the desire for closer antiretroviral drug access."
6204,0.004,4.0,"Several studies had previously demonstrated the high sensitivity and specificity of JCV DNA detection in CSF by PCR. This paper reported the implementation of a simple PCR procedure to detect JCV in the CSF in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients from Argentina. Years ago, the confirmatory diagnosis of this disease was made by in-situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry techniques on brain biopsies. The PCR procedure described here improves the diagnosis of PML because it is simple and noninvasive, and allows the differential diagnosis of PML from other neurological syndromes associated with AIDS. Many recent studies report a significant benefit of combined antiretroviral therapy on the survival of HIV patients without clear neurological improvements. A negative correlation has been described between the concentration of JCV in the CSF and survival time in HIV-1 infected patients, and the level of immune depression may influence JCV replication. This suggests that a single CSF JCV viral load determination during the course of PML disease progression may be of prognostic value for managing HIV patients."
119,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in HIV-positive individuals. Although HBV vaccination is mandatory for HIV-positive individuals with negative-HBV markers, lower rates of protection are achieved. HIV infection accelerates the course of liver disease caused by chronic HBV infection, leading to end-stage hepatic illness and increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Anti-HBV active agents, especially tenofovir, improve outcomes. Lamivudine alone should be limited to patients with low serum HBV-DNA levels, since selection of drug resistance often compromises long-term benefits, leads to cross-resistance with other antivirals, and favors the potential emergence of HBV-vaccine escape mutants.

531,0.004,4.0,"The authors reviewed the medical records of 194 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients newly diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis and all 3,564 patients with newly diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at San Francisco General Hospital for the period 1986-1992. The study was designed to address three questions: 1) How do AIDS patients who present with cryptosporidiosis differ from other patients with AIDS? 2) What factors are associated with survival among AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis? 3) Does a diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis impact survival after AIDS diagnosis? A total of 194 cases of cryptosporidiosis among HIV-infected patients were identified during the study period. Of the 194 patients, 109 (56%) had no prior diagnosis of AIDS. These 109 patients represented 3.1% of the 3,564 newly diagnosed cases of AIDS in the same period. Among the 134 patients with CD4 T-lymphocyte counts performed within 3 months of Cryptosporidium diagnosis, 34 (25%) had CD4 counts greater than 209 cells/ml. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the incidence of Cryptosporidium was related to ethnicity (for blacks vs. whites, matched odds ratio (OR) = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.73), CD4 count (for a CD4 count of < or = 53 cells/ml vs. > 53 cells/ml, matched OR = 12.60, 95% CI 4.01-39.61), and age (for a 10-year increase, matched OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.98). Two factors measured at the time of Cryptosporidium diagnosis were identified as being independently associated with survival (p < 0.001) in the proportional hazards model: CD4 count < or = 53 cells/ml versus > 53 cells/ml (relative hazard = 6.18, 95% CI 2.99-12.76) and hematocrit < or 37% versus > 37% (relative hazard = 2.27, 95% CI 1.22-4.22). The median durations of survival in the four subgroups of Cryptosporidium-infected patients defined by these two variables differed significantly from each other (range, 204-1,119 days). Cryptosporidiosis as an initial AIDS-defining diagnosis was associated with an elevated relative hazard of death in comparison with other AIDS-defining diagnoses (relative hazard = 2.01, 95% CI 1.38-2.93). These data identify the groups of HIV-infected individuals at risk for presentation with symptomatic Cryptosporidium infection; the distinct survival patterns among subgroups of those patients already infected with this parasite; and the survival of AIDS patients with newly diagnosed cryptosporidiosis relative to patients with other AIDS-defining conditions. Such information is necessary for the design of prospective studies, the development of prophylactic strategies, the evaluation of candidate therapies, and the provision of prognostic information to patients."
8310,0.004,4.0,"Polymorphism in the HLA region of a chromosome is the major source of host genetic variability in HIV-1 outcome, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B57, -B27, and -B51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort infected with clade B' HIV-1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain, and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study to understand HLA-B51-associated HIV-1 control. We focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B51-restricted epitopes: Gag327-345(NI9) NANPDCKTI, Pol743-751(LI9) LPPVVAKEI, and Pol283-289(TI8) TAFTIPSI. Mutations in all three dominant epitopes were significantly associated with HLA-B51 in the cohort. A clear hierarchy in selection of epitope mutations was observed through epitope sequencing. L743I in position 1 of epitope LI9 was seen in most B51(+) individuals, followed by V289X in position 8 of the TI8, and then, A328S, in position 2 of the NI9 epitope, was also seen in some B51(+) individuals. Good control of viral load and higher CD4(+) counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to unmutated epitopes, whereas lower CD4(+) counts and higher viral loads were observed in patients who had developed escape mutations in all three epitopes or who lacked T cell responses specific to these epitope(s). We propose that patients with HLA-B51 benefit from having multiple layers of effective defense against the development of immune escape mutations."
1187,0.004,4.0,"Patients with hepatitis C virus-related decompensated cirrhosis can benefit from interferon-based antiviral therapy, but the common complication of cytopenia is a contraindication for this treatment. Splenectomy prior to interferon therapy may alleviate this problem. To investigate whether splenectomy improves the efficacy of antiviral therapy, 13 interferon-naïve hepatitis C virus decompensated cirrhotic patients underwent splenectomy between January 2008 and January 2011, followed 1-3 months later by an interferon-based therapeutic regimen (pegylated/standard interferon-α combined with ribavirin for 48 weeks). Ten (76.9%) of the patients developed postoperative complications, which included minor portal vein thrombosis (2/13, 15.4%) and transient ascites (8/13, 61.5%). At one-month post-splenectomy, the patients showed significantly increased platelet (pre-surgery: 48.2±15.9 vs. 186.0±70.6×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) and leukocyte (2.1±0.5 vs. 5.7±1.4×10(3)μL(-1), p<0.001) counts. Eight (61.5%) of the patients achieved sustained virological response, including all HCV genotype 2a-infected patients (4/4, 100%) and some of the genotype 1b-infected patients (4/9, 44.4%). Temporary interferon-α suspension was required for one patient to address severe intestinal infection. These results indicate that splenectomy prior to interferon-based therapy was safe and may facilitate adherence to subsequent antiviral therapy in selected HCV cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and hypersplenism.

2810,0.004,4.0,"Several reports show that the prevalence of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infected populations is significantly higher than in HIV seronegative individuals, independent of the risk group for HIV, that is, homosexuals or drug abusers. In this context, evaluation of the simultaneous presence of HBV and HIV in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) is of particular interest for at least 2 reasons: 1) the possible reciprocal influence of the 2 viruses when they infect the same cell; 2) the possibility that HIV-induced hematological disorders could indirectly influence the settling of HBV in blood cell populations. We report data on the frequency of PCR positivity for HBV DNA in PBMCs from 62 HIV infected patients, rigorously selected by risk group, that is, intravenous use of heroin for at least 3 years and syringe promiscuity. Sixty-seven HIV negative individuals who never used any drug formed the control group. The analysis of the cases positive for HBV DNA in PBMCs showed that: 1) the overall prevalence of PCR positivity found in HIV infected patients was significantly lower than that registered in the control group; 2) PCR positivity among the subjects who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBV positive was extremely low in the HIV infected patients (3.7%) but quite frequent in the HIV negative subjects (37.0%). The results support the hypothesis that, unlike the HIV negative individuals, our HIV infected patients exhibited HBV DNA in PBMCS almost exclusively when they presented with active HBV replication."
992,0.004,4.0,"Although smoking is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, in resource-constrained, high HIV prevalence settings, information on smoking cessation intent and acceptability is limited. Of 150 self-reported current smokers surveyed in two South African HIV clinics, 62 (42%) reported intent to quit smoking in the next year, while 86 (58%) were not interested in quitting or had no plan to quit; 132 (82%) had attempted to quit at least once in the past. Respondents' preferred cessation strategies were counseling and nicotine replacement. A high proportion of HIV-infected smokers want to quit, and interventions should be provided as part of HIV care."
7875,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-specific CD8 T-cell responses targeting products encoded within the Gag open reading frame have frequently been associated with better viral control and disease outcome during the chronic phase of HIV infection. To further clarify this relationship, we have studied the dynamics of Gag-specific CD8 T-cell responses in relation to plasma viral load and time since infection in 33 chronically infected subjects over a 9-month period. High baseline viral loads were associated with a net loss of breadth (P < 0.001) and a decrease in the total magnitude of the Gag-specific T-cell response in general (P = 0.03). Most importantly, the baseline viral load predicted the subsequent change in the breadth of Gag recognition over time (P < 0.0001, r(2) = 0.41). Compared to maintained responses, lost responses were low in magnitude (P < 0.0001) and subdominant in the hierarchy of Gag-specific responses. The present study indicates that chronic exposure of the human immune system to high levels of HIV viremia is a determinant of virus-specific CD8 T-cell loss."
6663,0.004,4.0,"In the United States, of the 1.1 million persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the 2.7 million infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), approximately 16% and 50%, respectively, are unaware of their infection. Highly effective treatments have turned both diseases into manageable conditions, and in the case of hepatitis C, a disease that can be cured. Early diagnosis is imperative so that infected persons can take measures to stay healthy, get into care, benefit from therapy, and reduce the risk of transmission. In this report, we review current recommendations provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Preventive Services Task Force on whom to screen for HIV and HCV infections, and recommendations from the CDC, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute on how to test for these infections.

4856,0.004,4.0,"In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people."

1090,0.004,4.0,"This article reviews the research literature related to nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) concerning acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and care of people with AIDs (PWAs). Areas reviewed included the following: (1) KAP studies of health professionals that include nurses; (2) KAP studies of nurses; (3) KAP studies of nursing students and faculty; (4) studies of stress and coping related to care of PWAs; and (5) studies of outcomes of AIDS education programs. Gaps in knowledge and negative, fearful attitudes toward HIV transmission and PWAs were identified. Negative fears and behaviors decreased in nurses with the gain in accurate information. The studies were largely atheoretical descriptive surveys of health professionals in acute care settings. Studies of nurses specifically, including more studies of obstetric and pediatric nurses, and nurses in a range of settings in the community would be beneficial both in the United States and in other countries. A wider variety of research designs including qualitative studies are needed as are valid and reliable instruments to allow for cross-comparisons between studies. An assessment of non-AIDS-related content, such as spiritual needs of patients and substances abuse is needed by nurses who care for PWAs for use in development of relevant educational programs."
540,0.004,4.0,"Puerto Rico has one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS seen for any US state or territory, and antiretroviral therapy has been a mainstay of efforts to mitigate the HIV/AIDS public health burden on the island. We studied the evolutionary dynamics of HIV-1 mutation and antiretroviral drug resistance in Puerto Rico by monitoring the population frequency of resistance-associated mutations from 2002 to 2011. Whole blood samples from 4,475 patients were analyzed using the TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit and OpenGene DNA Sequencing System in the Immunoretrovirus Research Laboratory at Universidad Central del Caribe. Results show that 64.0% of female and 62.9% of male patients had HIV-1 mutations that confer resistance to at least one antiretroviral medication. L63P and M184V were the dominant mutations observed for the protease (PRO) and reverse transcriptase (RT) encoding genes, respectively. Specific resistance mutations, along with their associated drug resistance profiles, can be seen to form temporal clusters that reveal a steadily changing landscape of resistance trends over time. Both women and men showed resistance mutations for an average of 4.8 drugs over the 10-year period, further underscoring the strong selective pressure exerted by antiretrovirals along with the rapid adaptive response of HIV. Nevertheless, both female and male patients showed a precipitous decrease for overall drug resistance, and for PRO mutations in particular, over the entire course of the study, with the most rapid decrease in frequency seen after 2006. The reduced HIV-1 mutation and drug resistance trends that we observed are consistent with previous reports from multi-year studies conducted around the world. Reduced resistance can be attributed to the use of more efficacious antiretroviral drug therapy, including the introduction of multi-drug combination therapies, which limited the ability of the virus to mount rapid adaptive responses to antiretroviral selection pressure."
3186,0.004,4.0,"During infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV), most patients develop mild or asymptomatic disease. However, a small number of patients develop serious, life-threatening hepatitis. We investigated this variability in disease severity by examining 30 Argentinean patients with HAV-induced acute liver failure in a case-control, cross-sectional, observational study. We found that HAV-induced severe liver disease was associated with a 6-amino-acid insertion in TIM1/HAVCR1 (157insMTTTVP), the gene encoding the HAV receptor. This polymorphism was previously shown to be associated with protection against asthma and allergic diseases and with HIV progression. In binding assays, the TIM-1 protein containing the 157insMTTTVP insertion polymorphism bound HAV more efficiently. When expressed by human natural killer T (NKT) cells, this long form resulted in greater NKT cell cytolytic activity against HAV-infected liver cells, compared with the shorter TIM-1 protein without the polymorphism. To our knowledge, the 157insMTTTVP polymorphism in TIM1 is the first genetic susceptibility factor shown to predispose to HAV-induced acute liver failure. Furthermore, these results suggest that HAV infection has driven the natural selection of shorter forms of the TIM-1 protein, which binds HAV less efficiently, thereby protecting against severe HAV-induced disease, but which may predispose toward inflammation associated with asthma and allergy."
359,0.004,4.0,"To prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, it is important that health care providers adhere to standard precautions, follow fundamental infection-control principles, and use appropriate procedural techniques. All obstetrician-gynecologists who provide clinical care should receive the hepatitis B virus vaccine series. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America has established guidelines for the management of health care providers who are infected with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The guidelines categorize representative obstetric and gynecologic procedures according to level of risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission and include recommendations for health care provider clinical activities, based on these categories and viral burden. It is important to note that when no restrictions are recommended, careful supervision should be carried out as highlighted. These recommendations provide a framework within which to consider such cases; however, each case should be independently considered in context by the expert review panel. "
7355,0.004,4.0,Drug resistance is a major concern during nucleoside/ nucleotide analogues therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

6026,0.004,4.0,"Having noted the good clinical status of some HIV patients who were referred for but refused surgery, we undertook surgery with the aim of determining outcome, risk-to-benefit ratio and, if possible, the effect of surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the progression of their HIV disease. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVD) were not available to these patients. The records of 49 patients, 17 males and 32 females, aged between 17 and 67 years, undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass over a nine-year period, were reviewed. Forty-eight of these underwent cardiac surgery and one aortic dissection repair. Four HIV-infected patients underwent surgery with good early outcome. Thereafter an absolute CD4 cell count greater than 400/microl (normal 550*1 955/microl) and the absence of the stigmata of AIDS in patients fulfilling the normal criteria for surgery allowed cardiac surgery using CPB. Fifty operations were performed. Three patients with CD4 counts of 37, 868 and 1 245/microl died early, giving a 30-day mortality of 6% for 50 procedures. Six patients with active infective endocarditis (IE) underwent emergency surgery. Three of these, one with a pre- and two with only post-operative counts all below 250/microl, died within three months. Sixteen complications occurred in the remaining 46 patients (34.7%). Pre-operative CD4 cell counts taken in 42 patients averaged 685/microl. Pre- and post-operative counts known in eight showed variations, as did repeated counts in those awaiting surgery. Forty-one patients left hospital in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, five in class II and one in class III. Prior to surgery, the majority (38) were in class III and seven were in class IV. Follow up ranging from two to 70 months averaged 23.1 months. Eight late deaths occurred, three related to AIDS. We found surgery to be worthwhile in selected HIV-infected patients. Early outcome paralleled that in the uninfected, giving a low risk-to-benefit ratio. Emergency surgery in those with active infective endocarditis and marked immune compromise met with high mortality. It is essential in our population to test and stage all patients for HIV. We could not show that CPB accelerated progression to AIDS. This experience and the present availability of ARVDs would enable us to review our selection criteria for surgery."
4855,0.004,4.0,"Data on baseline hepatic function of HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infected patients are limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in Nigerian patients with HIV/HBV co-infection to highlight the impact of HIV on HBV-related liver disease in sub-Saharan Africa. A cross-sectional study involving 100 HIV/HBV co-infected patients and 100 age- and sex-matched HBV mono-infected controls. Blood testing for HIV antibodies, CD4+ cell count, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), LFTs, platelet count, fasting blood glucose and lipid profile were carried out. Non-invasive hepatic fibrosis scores (aspartate aminotransferase-platelet ratio index [APRI] and FIB-4) were also calculated. Co-infected patients had deranged liver enzymes more than the controls (77% versus 64%, P = 0.04). The predominant patterns of enzyme derangement in co-infected patients were either predominantly ↑ALP (30% versus 4%, P < 0.0001) or mixed (30% versus 15%, P = 0.01) but predominantly ↑AST/ALT in the controls (25% versus 9%, P = 0.003). Co-infected patients had higher fibrosis scores for both APRI (P = 0.002) and FIB-4 (P = 0.0001). On further analysis, LFT abnormalities and fibrosis scores were only significantly higher in co-infected patients in the immune clearance and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis phases. LFT abnormalities are common in Nigerians with HBV infection and co-infection with HIV negatively impacts on hepatic function."
8326,0.004,4.0,"Prevalence and risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were studied in 2,587 pregnant women from three rural Egyptian villages in the Nile Delta being admitted to a prospective cohort study of maternal-infant transmission; 408 (15.8%) had antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) and 279 (10.8%) also had HCV-RNA. Fewer than 1% gave a history of jaundice or liver disease. Risk factors for anti-HCV included increasing age, low socioeconomic status and a history of blood transfusion or injection therapy for schistosomiasis. Sub-analyses after stratification of subjects by village revealed risks associated with specific venues for medical care, having a previous delivery attended by a traditional birth assistant (TBA), receiving medical care in a temporary clinic located in a mosque, overnight admission to a private doctor's clinic, and circumcision by a TBA or a 'health barber'. Our results suggest HCV causes very little detected illness in young adult Egyptian women and some sources of HCV transmission in rural Egypt in the past were associated with the provision of medical care and varied by location. Prevention should be focused on providing appropriate resources and health education should be given to formal and informal health care providers and should be sufficiently broad to adjust for local variations in exposures."
7640,0.004,4.0,"Dementia was a frequent consequence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in developed countries before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available and remains a common neurologic complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among patients receiving appropriate therapy. The epidemiology of HIV dementia (HIV-D) in Africa remains unclear 20+ years into the AIDS epidemic. Early studies of cognitive impairment in HIV-positive populations in Africa were limited by vaguely defined criteria for cognitive impairment, inadequate assessment tools lacking ecologic validation, and the absence of normative population data. More recent studies have clarified definitions of impairment, utilized more sophisticated measures, and included normative comparisons. Unfortunately, these detailed neuropsychiatric assessments are not feasible for population-based studies or routine clinical implementation. Therefore, the prevalence data available for HIV-D in Africa represents rates found in people presenting to tertiary care centers and are unlikely to reflect HIV-D rates in the general population. As ART becomes available in Africa, future research efforts must provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of HIV-D, the effects of available ART regimens on HIV-D in this population, and the impact of HIV-D on ART adherence. Universally accepted terminology and criteria for HIV-D are needed. Population-based studies will require the development of neuropsychiatric batteries that can be adapted across a range of African environments. Ideally, these measures will be viable for nonphysician care providers to use as screening tools in the first stage of epidemiologic studies. Such screening tools could also serve as clinical indicators of possible HIV-related cognitive impairment facilitate implementation of ART adherence."
6349,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), formerly termed human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLVIII/LAV), is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Direct detection of HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences in patient tissue or blood samples is possible in only a minor fraction of cases due to the low percentage of infected cells (Shaw et al., 1984). We report a modification of the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985), in which we amplify sequences from HIV-1 RNA templates, for the identification of HIV-1 in peripheral blood and tissue samples obtained from AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients. This method of HIV-1 detection is at least six orders of magnitude more sensitive than standard nucleic acid detection methods and has direct clinical applications. In vitro tissue culturing of the virus is not required for HIV-1 detection. Using this technique, the sequence in the orfB region of HIV-1 has been amplified and detected from less than 1 microgram of total RNA prepared from a few milliliters of peripheral blood samples. This technique enables the rapid and unambiguous clinical detection of potential HIV-infected individuals and can be used to assay the efficacy of anti-HIV-1 drugs. To enhance the efficiency of this technique, we have appended the prokaryotic T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to one of the priming oligonucleotides. After several cycles of PCR with the promoter-containing oligo, a small aliquot of the reaction can be utilized to direct specific and efficient T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription of the amplified sequences, thus enhancing the sensitivity and simplifying the labor of the experiment."
5998,0.004,4.0,"To define factors predictive of failure to respond to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors in human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-infected subjects pretreated with zidovudine (ZDV), three groups of subjects shifted to double therapy with ZDV plus didanosine (ddI, n = 13), zalcitabine (ddC, n = 14), or lamivudine (3TC, n = 12) were retrospectively evaluated, with respect to addition of the second NRTI, at week 0 and week 24. Factors considered included duration of ZDV pretreatment, CD4+ cell counts, plasma HIV-1 RNA load, peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV-1 DNA load, and HIV-1 DNA genotypic resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The three groups were well matched for baseline characteristics and did not differ significantly in virological and immunological response to the different combination treatments. Drug-specific resistance mutations were selected in more than half the cases by 3TC, but not by ddI and ddC. Low-level and substantial genotypic resistance to ZDV was detected 13 (33.3%) and in 19 (48.7%) patients at baseline, respectively, and evolved through week 24 in several patients. When subjects were divided into responders and nonresponders to the second nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor on the basis of a decrease of more than 0.5 log10 (n = 15) or less than 0.5 log10 (n = 21) in HIV-1 RNA, respectively, baseline genotypic ZDV resistance was the only independent predictor of failure in a logistic regression model (P = 0.003 or P = 0.024, depending on whether low-level resistance was considered or not, respectively). Thus, selection of ZDV resistance mutations may impair subsequent use of different nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor compounds."

4552,0.004,4.0,"Patients with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection have more severe hepatitis-related disease than do patients with HCV infection alone. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with protease inhibitor appears to restore pathogen-specific immune responses, especially in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load. To evaluate the potent impact of immune restoration induced by HAART on the course of HCV-related disease, HCV viremia and levels of transaminases were compared between two groups of patients: 10 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistently undetectable HIV viremia (group A) and 12 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with persistent detectable HIV viremia. No difference was detected in HCV viral load in either group. An increase in transaminases was found only in patients with persistent undetectable HIV viral load, which was correlated with the increase in CD8+ T cells. This may suggest that the restoration of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity could lead to an enhancement of hepatitis C-related disease in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving HAART."
5405,0.004,4.0,The prevalence of hepatitisC is decreasing among new diagnoses of HIV/HCV coinfection in Spain. The increasing use of the HCV treatment could have changed the HCV genotype distribution. The aim of this study is to analyze changes in the prevalence of HCV coinfection and in HCV genotype distribution among HIV-infected patients.
682,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently causes neurological dysfunction and is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with HIV encephalitis or myelopathy. The virus is found mostly in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage within the CNS, but the possibility of infection of other glial cells has been raised. Therefore, the effects of different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains were studied in primary cultures of adult human brain containing microglial cells, the resident CNS macrophages, and astrocytes. These cultures could be productively infected with macrophage-adapted HIV-1 isolates but not with T lymphocyte-adapted HIV-1 isolates or two HIV-2 isolates. As determined with a triple-label procedure, primary astrocytes did not express HIV gag antigens and remained normal throughout the 3-week course of infection. In contrast, virus replicated in neighboring microglial cells, often leading to their cell fusion and death. The death of microglial cells, which normally serve immune functions in the CNS, may be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalitis or myelopathy."
3033,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) increases morbidity in Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. In the mid-eighties, an outbreak of HDV fulminant hepatitis (FH) in the Central African Republic (CAR) killed 88% of patients hospitalized in Bangui. We evaluated infections with HBV and HDV among students and pregnant women, 25 years after the fulminant hepatitis (FH) outbreak to determine (i) the prevalence of HBV and HDV infection in this population, (ii) the clinical risk factors for HBV and/or HDV infections, and (iii) to characterize and compare the strains from the FH outbreak in the 1980s to the 2010 HBV-HDV strains. We performed a cross sectional study with historical comparison on FH-stored samples (n = 179) from 159 patients and dried blood-spots from volunteer students and pregnant women groups (n = 2172). We analyzed risk factors potentially associated with HBV and HDV. Previous HBV infection (presence of anti-HBc) occurred in 345/1290 students (26.7%) and 186/870 pregnant women (21.4%)(p = 0.005), including 110 students (8.8%) and 71 pregnant women (8.2%), who were also HBsAg-positive (p = 0.824). HDV infection occurred more frequently in pregnant women (n = 13; 18.8%) than students (n = 6; 5.4%) (p = 0.010). Infection in childhood was probably the main HBV risk factor. The risk factors for HDV infection were age (p = 0.040), transfusion (p = 0.039), and a tendency for tattooing (p = 0.055) and absence of condom use (p = 0.049). HBV-E and HDV-1 were highly prevalent during both the FH outbreak and the 2010 screening project. For historical samples, due to storage conditions and despite several attempts, we could only obtain partial HDV amplification representing 25% of the full-length genome. The HDV-1 mid-eighties FH-strains did not form a specific clade and were affiliated to two different HDV-1 African subgenotypes, one of which also includes the 2010 HDV-1 strains. In the Central African Republic, these findings indicate a high prevalence of previous and current HBV-E and HDV-1 infections both in the mid-eighties fulminant hepatitis outbreak and among asymptomatic young adults in 2010, and reinforce the need for universal HBV vaccination and the prevention of HDV transmission among HBsAg-positive patients through blood or sexual routes."
7285,0.004,4.0,"The objective of this opinion paper was to identify and describe potential clinical pharmacists' services for the prevention and management of patients infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The goals of this paper are to guide the establishment and development of pharmacy services for patients infected with HCV and to highlight HCV research and educational opportunities. Recommendations were based on the following: a review of published data on clinical pharmacist involvement in the treatment and management of HCV-infected patients; a consensus of clinical pharmacists who provide direct patient care to HCV-infected patients and practice in different pharmacy models, including community-based and academic settings; and a review of published guidelines and literature focusing on the treatment and management of HCV infections. The recommendations provided in this opinion paper define the areas of clinical pharmacist involvement and clinical pharmacy practice in the treatment and management of patients with HCV. Clinical pharmacists can promote preventive measures and education about reducing HCV transmission, improve medication adherence, assist in monitoring clinical and adverse effects, recommend treatment strategies to minimize adverse effects and drug interactions, and facilitate medication acquisition and logistics that positively improve patient outcomes and reduce the health care system costs.

7128,0.004,4.0,"To investigate its use as a marker of disease severity, serum soluble CD4 (sCD4) was measured by ELISA in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Levels of sCD4 were higher in patients than in controls (P less than .001) but did not increase with disease severity. sCD4 release per CD4 lymphocyte showed a linear increase with disease severity and performed as well as beta 2-microglobulin, a widely used marker. To study the role of sCD4 in the pathogenesis of HIV infection, an ELISA to detect sCD4 complexed with glycoprotein 120 (gp120) HIV envelope protein was developed. Preformed sCD4-gp120 complexes were not detectable in patient serum, but addition of recombinant gp120 showed that circulating sCD4 is capable of binding HIV envelope proteins. This study indicates that the sCD4-to-CD4 lymphocyte ratio increases linearly with disease severity and may be a useful marker of CD4 lymphocyte damage. In addition, serum sCD4 can bind viral particles, which may have implications for the use of recombinant sCD4 as a therapy in HIV infection."
4386,0.004,4.0,"Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has deeply changed the landscape of HIV-associated malignancies. Some AIDS-defining tumors, namely Primitive Lymphoma of Central Nervous System, have drastically declined, whereas a steady increase has been observed for non-AIDS-defining tumors, maybe due to longer survival of HIV-infected people. Easier immune restoration, subsequent to availability of a number of drugs targeting HIV at different points, has decreased opportunistic infections which hampered treatment of HIV-associated cancers. As a matter of fact these patients have been assimilated more and more with their negative counterpart, undergoing the same aggressive approach. Consistently, procedures that have been so far precluded to HIV+ subjects, such as transplant of hemopoietic stem cells, either autologous or allogenic, and liver transplant are expected to be performed more and more extensively in this population. Which also would mean a full removal of the stigma which has weighed on it. Hence, it is true-like that malignancies and related problems may in the next future make up a main concern for the HIV specialist. Old and new challenges might be the drug-drug interaction of antiretrovirals or biotherapy-related infections or the debated question of an earlier HAART implementation in the course of HIV disease, with CD4+ cells > 500/μl. In fact, if assimilation of HIV patients with cancer and the general population is a remarkable achieved goal, uniqueness of HIV infection in terms of immune status still makes HIV-associated cancer a unique chapter in the setting of Oncology."
6573,0.004,4.0," Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Despite the good safety profile of the drug, Fanconi syndrome is a possible adverse reaction of TDF treatment, especially in HIV-infected patients. Only a few cases have been reported in patients with CHB-monoinfections. This report presents a case of a 58-year-old man with mild HBeAg-negative CHB who was exposed to TDF and developed drug-induced Fanconi syndrome. Renal dysfunction reverted after TDF discontinuation and a switch to entecavir, and viral replication remained suppressed. A literature review yielded six additional cases of TDF-induced Fanconi syndrome, all with risk factors for renal dysfunction despite the patients having normal glomerular filtration rates. We discuss the overall risk for Fanconi syndrome in CHB-monoinfected patients exposed to TDF and the importance of careful monitoring of glomerular and tubular functions even when pre-existing kidney disease is not present.

7221,0.004,4.0,"Delivery by elective cesarean section (ECS), cesarean section prior to labor and rupture of membranes, is associated with a lower rate of vertical transmission of HIV compared with other modes of delivery. The efficacy of ECS among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy or among women with low viral loads is unknown. In assessing the possible utility of ECS as an intervention to decrease vertical transmission in the United States and other countries, the potential risks associated with operative delivery as well as other considerations should also be addressed. Although cesarean section delivery is associated with an increased rate of postpartum morbidity compared with vaginal delivery in the general population, operative delivery performed emergently carries a higher risk of complications than scheduled or elective procedures. Analyses of the risk of postpartum morbidity according to mode of delivery among HIV-infected women have been performed in the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the largest database in North America with relevant data, as well as other, smaller databases. These analyses suggest a similar pattern to that observed in the general population. In addition to quantifying the incidence of postpartum morbidity events, it is also important to distinguish between minor and major morbidity. Neonatal morbidity related to ECS is generally due to iatrogenic preterm birth, that is, situations where the gestational age is not accurately assessed prior to delivery. Occupationally acquired HIV infection related to obstetric procedures is a possibility, although risk related to mode of delivery is unknown. The results of economic analyses of ECS compared to vaginal delivery in the US indicate that ECS is a cost-effective intervention in preventing vertical transmission of HIV among women who refrain from breastfeeding. However, more precise estimates of the risk of vertical transmission among women receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and of the potential risks of maternal and pediatric adverse events related to receipt of such therapy are needed. In summary, the benefit of ECS must be weighed against potential risks, and issues such as cost-effectiveness also should be taken into consideration."
8221,0.004,4.0,"The RNA genome of the lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is significantly richer in adenine nucleotides than the statistically equal distribution of the four different nucleotides that is expected. This compositional bias may be due to the guanine-to-adenine (G-->A) nucleotide hypermutation of the HIV genome, which has been explained by dCTP pool imbalances during reverse transcription. The adenine nucleotide bias together with the poor fidelity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase markedly enhances the genetic variation of HIV and may be responsible for the rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. We have now attempted to counteract the normal mutational pattern of HIV-1 in response to anti-HIV-1 drugs by altering the endogenous deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool ratios with antimetabolites in virus-infected cell cultures. We showed that administration of these antimetabolic compounds resulted in an altered drug resistance pattern due to the reversal of the predominant mutational flow of HIV (G-->A) to an adenine-to-guanine (A-->G) nucleotide pattern in the intact HIV-1-infected lymphocyte cultures. Forcing the virus to change its inherent nucleotide bias may lead to better control of viral drug resistance development."
6578,0.004,4.0,"A study of 215 Berlin dentists and 108 dental assistants recruited at the 1997 Berlin Dental Society meeting assessed their occupational risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. HBV vaccine coverage, and barrier prevention methods used. Among dentists, 7% (95% CI 4-11) and 0.5% (95% CI 0-3) had serological evidence of previous HBV and HCV infection, respectively. Similar figures for dental assistants were 1% (95% CI 0-5) and 0% (95% CI 0-4). Only 74% of dentists and 63% of dental assistants reported HBV vaccination. Approximately half always used gloves, eye glasses, or face masks. HBV unvaccinated dentists whose patients had HBV risk factors had a greater risk of HBV infection; those who always wore face masks were at lower risk (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.02-0.98). These data indicate that among Berlin dentists, the HCV risk was lower than that of HBV and that face masks may have lowered the risk of HBV. The use of eye glasses or gloves did not appear to lower the risk of HBV acquisition in this population."
7341,0.004,4.0,"Dried blood spot (DBS) is a reliable method of blood collection used for the diagnosis of several human diseases. DBS is particularly useful for diagnosing children and for the screening of high-risk populations especially in countries where health facilities are not readily accessible. This report describes a qualitative SYBR Green-based real-time multiplex RT-PCR for the simultaneous detection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes in DBS. Specific viral amplicons were identified in the same sample by their distinctive melting temperatures. The analysis of scalar concentrations of the reference samples indicated that this multiplex procedure detects at least 2500 copies/ml of HCV and 400 copies/ml of HIV-1. HIV-1 and HCV viral loads in 20 patients infected with HIV-1 and/or HCV and in 5 healthy blood donors were also tested, confirming the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This method may represent a reliable alternative for the detection of HIV-1/HCV co-infection, in rapid and relatively inexpensive screening programmes."
57,0.004,4.0,"We wished to undertake molecular characterization of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene and overlapping surface (S) gene in lamivudine-treated patients with chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequencing analyses of the HBV RT/S gene of isolates from 25 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with the YMDD mutation and 30 treatment-naïve CHB patients were undertaken. In patients with the YMDD mutation, rtM2041 was the major type of mutation (20/25, 80%). rtL80I was present in most of the patients with rtM204I (14/20, 70%). rtL180M coexisted with rtM204V (5/5, 100%). Patients with the YMDD mutation had a significantly higher prevalence of mutation of the RT gene than treatment-naïve CHB patients (P < 0.05). Classical primary resistance and secondary/compensatory mutations were detected at only five sites (rtL80, rtV173, rtL180, rtM204, rtM250) in CHB patients with the YMDD mutation. The frequency of nucleos(t)ide analog resistance (NAr) mutation within the RT gene in patients with the YMDD mutation was significantly higher than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). Amino-acid mutations within the RT gene were also associated with other types of NAr in patients with the YMDD mutation. The rate of amino-acid variants within the S gene region was significantly higher in patients with the YMDD mutation than that in treatment-naïve patients (P < 0.05). sM133L and sG145R variants were also present in patients with the YMDD mutation. These observations suggest that CHB patients with the YMDD mutation also have NAr mutations related to other NA drugs, which might lead to cross-resistance in CHB patients. Variants present in the S gene region could cause changes in the antigenicity of HBsAg, which could result in a false-negative diagnosis of HBsAg and immune in escape of the HBV."

4172,0.004,4.0,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is believed to be associated with reduced hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity and risk factors such as alcohol abuse and medication with oral contraceptives and certain other drugs. Recently it has been suggested that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may also be associated with PCT. We have therefore reviewed the prevalence of HCV infection in a series of patients with PCT in the Lothian region of Scotland. We identified 12 patients with PCT, all of whom had abnormal liver function tests. Liver histology revealed chronic active hepatitis in six patients, micronodular cirrhosis in four patients, hepatocellular carcinoma in one patient and normal findings in one HIV positive patient. Out of 12 patients tested, 11 were positive for anti-HCV antibodies by second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA 2), and by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA 2); positive serology was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a second group of 14 patients with chronic HCV infection matched for age and sex with the PCT patients, all had normal urinary uroporphyrin excretion. We have thus confirmed in Scotland early reports from Spain and Italy that PCT is strongly associated with HCV infection. This could explain the development of inflammatory changes in the liver and progression of liver disease in patients with PCT. Porphyrin metabolism, however, appears normal in patients with chronic HCV infection without PCT."
2566,0.004,4.0,"Infection of macrophages has been implicated as a critical event in the transmission and persistence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Here, we explore whether primary X4 HIV-1 isolates can productively infect tissue macrophages that have terminally differentiated in vivo. Using immunohistochemistry, HIV-1 RNA in situ hybridization, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that macrophages residing in human tonsil blocks can be productively infected ex vivo by primary X4 HIV-1 isolates. This challenges the model in which macrophage tropism is a key determinant of the selective transmission of R5 HIV-1 strains. Infection of tissue macrophages by X4 HIV-1 may be highly relevant in vivo and contribute to key events in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
6649,0.004,4.0,"HIV subtype C is the most prevalent subtype in the world. Despite its recent expansion in Brazil, HIV-1C already prevails in the southernmost state of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul. This unique HIV epidemiology has prompted us to characterize that population. Seventy-seven HIV-1-infected subjects attending the largest HIV/AIDS clinic of the state had the protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of their virus subtyped and genotyped. When subtype-specific infections were plotted according to year of diagnosis, the prevalence of subtype C was shown to increase over the last 18 years of the epidemic, along with a concomitant decrease of subtype B. Comparison of subtype C-infected treated and untreated subjects revealed amino acid differences in protease and RT, especially in the RT mutation D/G123S. The overall analysis of drug resistance mutations in viruses from treated subjects has highlighted some associations between subtypes and particular mutations, such as V82A/F/T/S in protease and subtype F1 and M41L and L210W in RT and subtype B. The characterization of this important population, which is one of a few in the developing world where a large number of HIV-1C-infected subjects are under antiretroviral treatment, underscores its potential usefulness in clinical, treatment, and vaccine trials in Brazil."
2031,0.004,4.0,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but more public health resources are allocated to HIV than to HCV. Given shared risk factors and epidemiology, we compared accuracy of health beliefs about HIV and HCV in an at-risk community. Between 2002 and 2003, we surveyed a random patient sample at a primary care clinic in New York. The survey was organized as domains of Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation: causes ('sharing needles'), timeline/consequences ('remains in body for life', 'causes cancer') and controllability ('I can avoid this illness', 'medications may cure this illness'). We compared differences in accuracy of beliefs about HIV and HCV and used multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with relative accuracy of beliefs. One hundred and twenty-two subjects completed the survey (response rate 42%). Mean overall health belief accuracy was 12/15 questions (80%) for HIV vs 9/15 (60%) for HCV (P < 0.001). Belief accuracy was significantly different across all domains. Within the causes domain, 60% accurately believed sharing needles a risk factor for HCV compared to 92% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the timeline/consequences domain, 42% accurately believed HCV results in lifelong infection compared to 89% for HIV (P < 0.001). Within the controllability domain, 25% accurately believed that there is a potential cure for HCV. Multivariable linear regression revealed female gender as significantly associated with greater health belief accuracy for HIV. Thus, study participants had significantly less accurate health beliefs about HCV than about HIV. Targeting inaccuracies might improve public health interventions to foster healthier behaviours and better hepatitis C outcomes."

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) can experience multiple physical symptoms or problems related to HIV infection and treatment. A common problem for PLWHA continues to be diarrhea and nausea and vomiting (NV). Diarrhea and NV can negatively impact the quality of life and adherence to medication therapy among PLWHA and are common reasons to change or discontinue HAART regimens. Because diarrhea and NV can have substantial negative health outcomes for PLWHA, it is important to understand the causes of these conditions."
2186,0.004,4.0,"A successful pregnancy is characterised by an increase in Th2 cytokines and suppression of Th1 cytokine production. A Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift is also observed in the disease progression of HIV infection. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suppresses HIV viremia, increases CD4+ cell counts and counteracts the Th1 to Th2 shift. We hypothesised that the increased risk of premature delivery reported in HIV-infected, HAART-treated pregnant women is mediated through changes in the cytokine environment in pregnancy. Here, we present results relating to levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Th1) and IL-10 (Th2) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) measured three times during pregnancy in 49 HIV-infected women. Slope values representing the trend of repeated cytokine (IL-2-PHA, IL-2-Env, IL-10-PHA and IL-10-Env) measurements within women during pregnancy were estimated and median values compared by prematurity and HAART use. Multiple regression adjusted for HAART and cytokine slope clarified the additional and independent effect of HAART on prematurity risk. Results showed favourable immunomodulation induced by HAART with increased IL-2 and decreased IL-10. HAART use and IL-10-Env slopes were not significantly associated with prematurity risk, but each unit increase in IL-2-PHA slope was associated with an 8% increased risk of premature delivery (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.0-1.17; p=0.005). HAART use in pregnancy provides significant benefits in delaying HIV disease progression and reducing the risk of mother-to-child-transmission, but may be counterproductive in terms of successful pregnancy outcome."
3228,0.004,4.0,"To our knowledge, the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during long-term care has not been reported. For 13 months, we observed HIV-infected patients (50 men and 15 women) in a dedicated 21-bed unit in a long-term-care facility to determine the rate of nosocomial infections. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (range, 22-78 years); 74% of the patients had CD4 cell counts of < 200/mm3. There was a total of 152 infections (24 infections per 1,000 long-term-care days). The factors associated with the occurrence of a nosocomial infection were low CD4 cell counts, poor functional status, and longer duration of stays at the facility. The three most common infections were Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, primary bacteremia, and urinary tract infection. Eighteen hospital-manifested opportunistic infections occurred. More than 50% of the cases of bacteremia were due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Nosocomial infections occur commonly in HIV-infected patients in long-term care and thus are important considerations in patient management."
2416,0.004,4.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) constitute the main burden of infectious disease in resource-limited countries. In the individual host, the two pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV, potentiate one another, accelerating the deterioration of immunological functions. In high-burden settings, HIV coinfection is the most important risk factor for developing active TB, which increases the susceptibility to primary infection or reinfection and also the risk of TB reactivation for patients with latent TB. M. tuberculosis infection also has a negative impact on the immune response to HIV, accelerating the progression from HIV infection to AIDS. The clinical management of HIV-associated TB includes the integration of effective anti-TB treatment, use of concurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART), prevention of HIV-related comorbidities, management of drug cytotoxicity, and prevention/treatment of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

9205,0.004,4.0,"This paper examines factors associated with adherence to antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in an HIV-infected population at high risk for non-adherence: individuals living with psychiatric and substance abuse disorders. Data were examined from baseline interviews of a multisite cohort intervention study of 1138 HIV-infected adults with both a psychiatric and substance abuse disorder (based on a structured psychiatric research interview using DSM-IV criteria). The baseline interview documented mental illness and substance use in the past year, mental illness and substance abuse severity, demographics, service utilization in the past three months, general health and HIV-related conditions, self-reported spirituality and self-reported ARV medication use. Among the participants, 62% were prescribed ARVs at baseline (n = 542) and 45% of those on ARVs reported skipping medications in the past three days. Reports of non-adherence were significantly associated with having a detectable viral load (p<.01). The factors associated with non-adherence were current drug and alcohol abuse, increased psychological distress, less attendance at medical appointments, non-adherence to psychiatric medications and lower self-reported spirituality. Increased psychological distress was significantly associated with non-adherence, independent of substance abuse (p<.05). The data suggest that both mental illness and substance use must be addressed in HIV-infected adults living with these co-morbid illnesses to improve adherence to ARVs."
9057,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, HCV, HDV, and HEV was evaluated in 249 apparently healthy individuals, including 122 inhabitants in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia, and 127 age- and sex-matched members of nomadic tribes who lived around the capital city. Overall, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in 24 subjects (10%), of whom 22 (92%) had detectable HBV DNA. Surprisingly, HDV RNA was detectable in 20 (83%) of the 24 HBsAg-positive subjects. HCV-associated antibodies were detected in 41 (16%) and HCV RNA was detected in 36 (14%) subjects, none of whom was coinfected with HBV, indicating that HBV/HCV carriers account for one-fourth of this population. Antibodies to HAV and HEV were detected in 249 (100%) and 28 (11%) subjects, respectively. Of 22 HBV DNA-positive subjects, genotype D was detected in 21 subjects and genotype F was detected in 1 subject. All 20 HDV isolates recovered from HDV RNA-positive subjects segregated into genotype I, but these differed by 2.1 to 11.4% from each other in the 522- to 526-nucleotide sequence. Of 36 HCV RNA-positive samples, 35 (97%) were genotype 1b and 1 was genotype 2a. Reflecting an extremely high prevalence of hepatitis virus infections, there were no appreciable differences in the prevalence of hepatitis virus markers between the two studied populations with distinct living place and lifestyle. A nationwide epidemiological survey of hepatitis viruses should be conducted in an effort to prevent de novo infection with hepatitis viruses in Mongolia."
9920,0.004,4.0,"The prevalence, virological and epidemiological aspects of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections vary among hemodialysis patients in different countries. Aiming at analyzing these aspects of HCV and HBV infections in hemodialysis patients in Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, we studied three hemodialysis units including 434 patients. Serology was used to detect anti-HCV and HBsAg. Reverse trancriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested-PCR) of the 5'-noncoding region was used to detect circulating HCV RNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for genotyping. Seroprevalence varied from 26.5% to 11.1% for hepatitis C and from 5.9% to 0% for hepatitis B. Risk factors observed for HBV and/or HCV infections were the number of patients per dialysis unit, duration of treatment, number of clinics attended, number of blood units transfused, and lower level scholarity. Alanine aminotransferase levels were altered with a higher frequency in HBV or HCV seropositive patients. Half of ten patients, negative for anti-HCV, had detectable viremia by RT-nested-PCR, indicating that this technique should be used to confirm infections in this group of patients. The HCV genotype 1 was the most frequently observed, followed by the genotype 2, but no correlation was detected between genotype and clinical or epidemiological data."
5515,0.004,4.0,"Immunosuppression may be etiologic for some skin cancers. We investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and solid-organ transplantation on skin cancer risk. We conducted a population-based case-control study among elderly U.S. adults (non-Hispanic whites, age 67 years or older), using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare linked data. The study comprised 29,926 skin cancer cases (excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) and 119,704 controls, frequency-matched by gender, age and calendar year (1987-2002). Medicare claims identified solid-organ transplantation or HIV infection before cancer diagnosis/control selection. As negative controls, we evaluated other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension and depression) and cancers (breast, colon and prostate) not linked to immunosuppression. Odds ratios (ORs) compared prevalence in cases and controls, adjusted for matching factors and number of prior physician claims. Risks of Kaposi sarcoma (N = 602) and cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 1,836) were increased with solid-organ transplantation (OR [95%CI]: 11.06 [5.27-23.23] and 2.27 [1.00-5.15], respectively) and HIV infection (21.58 [11.94-38.99] and 2.41 [1.05-5.52], respectively). Solid-organ transplantation was also associated with increased risks of Merkel cell carcinoma (N = 1,286; OR [95%CI] 4.95 [2.62-9.34]) and other cutaneous sarcomas (N = 972; 4.19 [1.83-9.56]). Solid-organ transplantation was nonsignificantly associated with melanoma (N = 23,974; (OR 1.36 [95%CI 0.98-1.88]). Null or weak associations were observed for negative control medical conditions and cancers. Solid-organ transplantation and HIV infection were followed by increased risk for some skin cancer subtypes among elderly adults. These results highlight the potential role of immunity in development of skin cancers."

Recent studies suggest psychosocial risk factors have important prognostic significance in HIV disease. The objective of the present study was to examine the prognostic influence of age, general intellectual functioning, and emotional distress across the spectrum of HIV disease progression. The study sample was drawn from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), a 13-year, prospective study of HIV-seropositive men recruited from four study centers across the country. The participants were 1,231 HIV-seropositive MACS participants, followed from baseline (median 8/15/87) to the end of the observation period (12/15/98). HIV disease progression was evaluated with respect to three outcome measures: (1) number of years from baseline testing to the first AIDS defining illness (progression to AIDS), (2) years from baseline to HIV-dementia (progression to dementia), and (3) years from baseline to death (survival). The influence of psychosocial risk factors on outcome measures was evaluated using survival analyses. General intellectual functioning, age, and somatic symptoms of depression, were found to be significant predictors of HIV disease progression and survival. Older age at baseline was associated with a more rapid progression to dementia and death. Lower Shipley IQ estimates were associated with a more rapid disease progression (AIDS and dementia) and shortened survival. Somatic symptoms of depression were associated with shortened survival. In addition, age, IQ, and somatic symptoms of depression, had an additive effect with an increase in the number of risk factors associated with accelerated disease progression and shortened time to death. These findings remained consistent, despite controlling for baseline CD4 and HIV medication use. Psychosocial cofactors are important in understanding HIV disease progression. Methods for estimating HIV prognosis may become more reliable if psychosocial factors are considered. Future research will clarify if psychosocial risk factors reflect central nervous system integrity, brain reserve capacity or mediate morbidity and mortality through social economic status, access to health care and other social correlates."
6138,0.004,4.0,"The rate at which immunodeficiency develops in untreated human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1)-infected persons might be increasing or decreasing over time because of viral evolution or other factors. Beginning in 1984, Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study investigators recruited HIV-1-seronegative homosexual/bisexual men from four US metropolitan areas and examined them semiannually for HIV-1 seroconversion. To assess possible secular changes in the natural history of HIV-1 infection, the authors examined CD4+ lymphocyte data from 354 men who seroconverted between 1984 and 1991. To control for measurement differences among centers and over time, the authors adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte values to those of persistently seronegative participants. CD4+ lymphocyte percentage measurements at the first seropositive visit formed a U-shaped pattern, with the lowest values observed in 1988 and 1989. The authors observed no consistent secular pattern of CD4+ percentages at later visit dates, except that mean CD4+ percentages were consistently lowest in men who seroconverted in 1988. In a proportional hazards model, the time to the adjusted CD4+ lymphocyte count of < 500 cells/mm3 was not associated with the secular time of seroconversion (relative hazard = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.13). The authors' data do not suggest a major change in the natural history of HIV-1 infection of this population."
1551,0.004,4.0,"This exploratory analyses characterizes patterns of lymphocyte recovery in HIV-1-infected patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and investigates their relationship with baseline indices and virologic responses. We modeled kinetics of total CD4+ lymphocytes, as well as naive (CD45RA+ CD62L+), and memory (CD45RA- CD45RO+) subsets in 48 patients treated with AZT/3TC/Ritonavir for 48 weeks in ACTG protocol 315. Cell kinetic indices were estimated by nonlinear regression methods and were correlated with baseline factors and virologic responses. Five different kinetic patterns were identified, including biphasic growth, growth-plateau, growth-depletion, decay-recovery, and biphasic decay. Although overall mean lymphocyte responses showed a biphasic increase in cell number, a careful investigation reveals that only one-third of patients actually followed the biphasic growth pattern in CD4+ cell response, while 44% of 48 patients from this study followed the growth-depletion pattern. CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase and the 48-week study period were negatively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell counts, and positively correlated with baseline viral load. Memory CD4+ cell recovery during the first phase was also negatively correlated with baseline memory CD4+ and total CD4+ cell number, but the recovery rate of memory CD4+ cells during the second phase was positively correlated with baseline CD4+ cell number. Patients with a decay in CD4+ cell count during treatment were more likely to have experienced virological rebound (58%) than patients with nondecay patterns (24%). The rate and magnitude of the absolute increase in total CD4+ and memory CD4+ cell number (but not naive CD4+ cells) during the second phase were lower in patients with viral rebound compared with patients with persistent viral suppression. These results show that the kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution in response to potent antiretroviral therapy in individual patients vary considerably from the ""classic"" biphasic increase that characterizes the mean or median response pattern. Pattern analysis of lymphocyte kinetics may be useful for testing relationships among factors that modulate the response to treatment."
3877,0.004,4.0,"Twenty-six antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), targeting five different steps in the life cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, HIV-1 phenotypic assays based on common cloning technology currently employ three, or possibly four, different recombinant viruses. Here, we describe a system to assess HIV-1 resistance to all drugs targeting the three viral enzymes as well as viral assembly using a single patient-derived, chimeric virus. Patient-derived p2-INT (gag-p2/NCp7/p1/p6/pol-PR/RT/IN) products were PCR amplified as a single fragment (3,428 bp) or two overlapping fragments (1,657 bp and 2,002 bp) and then recombined into a vector containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae uracil biosynthesis gene (URA3) replacing the 3,428 bp p2-INT segment (Dudley et al., Biotechniques 46:458-467, 2009). P2-INT-recombinant viruses were employed in drug susceptibility assays to test the activity of protease (PI), nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase (NRTI), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (NNRTI), and integrase strand-transfer (INSTI) inhibitors. Using a single standardized test (ViralARTS HIV), this new technology permits the rapid and automated quantification of phenotypic resistance for all known and candidate antiretroviral drugs targeting all viral enzymes (PR, RT, including polymerase and RNase H activities, and IN), some of the current and potential assembly inhibitors, and any drug targeting Pol or Gag precursor cleavage sites (relevant for PI and maturation inhibitors) This novel assay may be instrumental (i) in the development and clinical assessment of novel ARV drugs and (ii) to monitor patients failing prior complex treatment regimens."
4954,0.004,4.0,"Patients with inherited bleeding disorders who received clotting factor concentrates before 1987 have high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HCV/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To determine whether the persistent nature of HIV affects the genetic diversity of HCV by less selective pressure through the immunosuppression of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, both the change of genetic diversity and selective pressure were examined in the HCV envelope genes (E1 and E2) of 325 genotype 1a subclones from eight HIV-positive and five HIV-negative patients with two time points (more than 6 years apart). To infer the genetic diversity of HCV in each patient, we used two approaches. One method was to estimate the difference of total evolutionary distances in the phylogenetic tree between the two time points, and another was to estimate the changes of genetic diversity along the time based on the coalescence theory. The two results indicate that the HIV-positive group has significantly more diverse population structure than the HIV-negative group. A comparative analysis of the synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions found that the HIV-positive group was subject to less selective pressure than the HIV-negative group. In conclusion, HIV-positive patients would have a more diversified HCV population than HIV-negative patients due to less selective pressure from the immune system."

4345,0.004,4.0,"To examine the prevalence, quantification, and factors that influence HIV in the cell-free compartment of breast milk, we performed reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on samples obtained from HIV-1-infected study subjects. Virus was detected in 86 of 136 samples (63.2%) from 79 study subjects. HIV RNA quantity ranged from undetectable to 227,586 copies/ml. Prevalence and mean viral load were not affected by postnatal ages or maternal vitamin A supplementation. Among study subjects with multiple samples, breast milk viral load did not change at different postnatal ages. Breast milk viral load correlated positively with plasma viral load (r = 0.47; p =.005) and negatively with maternal CD4 count at entry to the study (r = -0.26; p =.02). Mothers of HIV-infected children had a higher proportion of detectable HIV RNA in their breast milk than mothers of uninfected children (p =.03) and higher mean log10 HIV RNA quantities (p =.04). In a multivariate logistic regression model, log10 HIV RNA quantity in breast milk was significantly associated with the risk of mother-child transmission (odds ratio [OR], 2.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-6.51). Thus, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections and of mastitis and early weaning may be important elements of a public health policy that is relevant to women in developing countries with HIV infection. Where available, antiretrovirals may also have an impact on opportunistic infections and mastitis."
3856,0.004,4.0,"Because milk-borne transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diminishes the benefits of perinatal antiviral drug therapy in developing countries, we have developed a new strategy to prevent postnatal and, possibly, intrapartum virus transmission in a primate model. Eight neonatal rhesus macaques were exposed orally to pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV); 4 neonates were then given intramuscular postexposure prophylaxis with 3 anti-HIV human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nMAbs) with potent cross-clade and cross-group neutralization activity. Untreated infants experienced high viral RNA levels and CD4(+) T-cell losses and died (median survival time, 5.5 weeks). In contrast, all 4 nMAb-treated neonates were protected from infection (P=.028); their plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and lymph nodes remained virus negative for >1 year. These data are important for designing clinical trials in human neonates and have general implications for AIDS vaccine development, as the epitopes recognized by the 3 nMAbs are conserved among diverse primary isolates."
7725,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that has a worldwide distribution and infects millions of people. Care-associated HCV infections represented a huge part of hepatitis C burden in the past via contaminated blood and unsafe injections and continue to be a serious problem of public health. The present review proposes a panorama of health care-associated HCV infections via the three mode of contamination that have been identified: (1) infected patient to non-infected patient; (2) infected patient to non-infected health care worker (HCW); and (3) infected HCW to non infected patient. For each condition, the circumstances of contamination are described together with the means to prevent them. As a whole, the more important risk is represented by unsafe practices regarding injections, notably with the improper use of multidose vials used for multiple patients. The questions of occupational exposures and infected HCWs are also discussed. In terms of prevention and surveillance, the main arm for combating care-associated HCV infections is the implementation of standard precautions in all the fields of cares, with training programs and audits to verify their good application. HCWs must be sensitized to the risk of blood-borne pathogens, notably by the use of safety devices for injections and good hygiene practices in the operating theatre and in all the invasive procedures. The providers performing exposed-prone procedures must monitor their HCV serology regularly in order to detect early any primary infection and to treat it without delay. With the need to stay vigilant because HCV infection is often a hidden risk, it can be hoped that the number of people infected by HCV via health care will decrease very significantly in the next years.

3901,0.004,4.0,"Infants born to HIV-1-infected mothers in resource-limited areas where replacement feeding is unsafe and impractical are repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 throughout breastfeeding. Despite this, the majority of infants do not contract HIV-1 postnatally, even in the absence of maternal antiretroviral therapy. This suggests that immune factors in breast milk of HIV-1-infected mothers help to limit vertical transmission. We compared the HIV-1 envelope-specific breast milk and plasma antibody responses of clade C HIV-1-infected postnatally transmitting and nontransmitting mothers in the control arm of the Malawi-based Breastfeeding Antiretrovirals and Nutrition Study using multivariable logistic regression modeling. We found no association between milk or plasma neutralization activity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or HIV-1 envelope-specific IgG responses and postnatal transmission risk. While the envelope-specific breast milk and plasma IgA responses also did not reach significance in predicting postnatal transmission risk in the primary model after correction for multiple comparisons, subsequent exploratory analysis using two distinct assay methodologies demonstrated that the magnitudes of breast milk total and secretory IgA responses against a consensus HIV-1 envelope gp140 (B.con env03) were associated with reduced postnatal transmission risk. These results suggest a protective role for mucosal HIV-1 envelope-specific IgA responses in the context of postnatal virus transmission. This finding supports further investigations into the mechanisms by which mucosal IgA reduces risk of HIV-1 transmission via breast milk and into immune interventions aimed at enhancing this response."
9671,0.004,4.0,"Even though potent antiretrovirals are available against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection, therapy fails in a significant fraction of patients. Among the most relevant reasons for treatment failure are drug toxicity and side effects, but also the development of viral resistance towards the drugs applied. Efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC-) transporters represents one major mechanism influencing the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs and particularly their distribution, thus modifiying the concentration within the infected cells, that is, at the site of action. Moreover, drug-drug interactions may occur at the level of these transporters and modulate their activity or expression thus influencing the efficacy and toxicity of the substrate drugs. This review summarizes current knowledge on the interaction of antiretrovirals used for HIV-1 therapy with ABC-transporters and highlights the impact of ABC-transporters for cellular resistance and therapeutic success. Moreover, the suitability of different cell models for studying the interaction of antiretrovirals with ABC-transporters is discussed."

The association of HPV16 and 18 variant lineages with race, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, CD4+ T-cell count, HIV-RNA level, time-to-clearance of HPV infection and presence of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study was studied. Subjects were followed semi-annually with Pap smear and cervicovaginal lavage (CVL). HPV DNA was detected in CVLs using MY09/11 L1 PCR assay. Specimens positive for HPV16/18 underwent E6 PCR and sequencing to determine the variant present. Specimens from 195 HPV16- and 162 HPV18-positive women were classified into variant lineages based on sequencing results. African variants of HPV16 and HPV18 were significantly more prevalent among African-Americans than among Caucasians [42 versus 14 % (P=0.001) and 60 versus 13 % (P<0.001), respectively]. However, it was not possible to detect associations between the HPV16 or 18 variant lineages and other factors studied. African variants of HPV16/18 were more common in women of African descent living outside Africa, which could reflect mixing behaviours and/or immunogenetic factors. However, in a large population of HIV-infected women, the variant of HPV16 or 18 was unrelated to persistence of infection or presence of SIL. If non-European variants are more oncogenic, the effect may involve a late stage in cervical tumorigenesis."
6793,0.004,4.0,"A survey was carried out on a random sample of GPs in the city of Marseille. 18.5% had been involved during the past year in a regular follow-up of HIV patients. They were in charge with 79.8% of all ambulatory care of HIV+ patients. Those informally 'specialized' professionals were connected to health networks (not only hospital structures but also associations dealing with commitment in care). Socio-biographical factors, training and environmental opportunities and ideological orientations would positively relate with commitment in care. GPs who were not involved with care, would worry more about personal risk of contamination; would not believe that wearing gloves could be a sufficient protection when doing invasive procedures; would feel less at ease with HIV patients, would be more strongly in favor of coercive measures with IVDU's. Most GP's would agree to avoid drug users HIV+ patients. They would attribute to them more guilt and responsibility than to other patients. Uncertainty concerning relevant knowledge, negative attitudes towards some patients like IVDU's and anticipated difficulties to deal with ethical and relational dilemmas keep limiting GPs interest and positive motivation in care for HIV patients."

However, differential susceptibility in institutionalized populations suggest that HCV infection is even more prevalent in prison populations than previously reported yet, routine screening for HCV infection among prisoners is not generally available. We estimated the HCV prevalence and identified associated exposures at two maximum-security prisons using data obtained from 2788 inmates from the Risk Factors for Spread of Staphylococcus aureus in Prisons Study in New York, which recruited participants from January 2009 and January 2013. HCV prevalence was 10.1% (n=295); injection drug use, injection drug use sex partners, and HIV diagnosis exhibited the strongest associations with HCV infection in multivariable models, adjusting for covariates. Taken together, the findings of the present study provide an updated estimate of HCV prevalence and suggest that incarcerated populations represent a declining yet significant portion of the hepatitis epidemic.

3820,0.004,4.0,"Multidrug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains with reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations at codons A62-->V, V75-->I, F77-->L, F116-->Y, and Q151-->M have been reported in patients receiving combination therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI). Infectious clones with each mutation alone, all five mutations together, and various combinations of mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation Q151-->M conferred partial resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine, whereas a combination of four mutations conferred increased resistance to AZT, ddI, zalcitibine, and stavudine. The positions of residues 75, 77, and 151 in the three-dimensional crystal structure of HIV-1 RT suggest that these residues may affect the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between deoxynucleoside triphosphates and nucleoside analog RT inhibitors. Replication experiments showed that clones with mutation F77-->L but without V75-->I (HIV-1(77), HIV-1(77,151), and HIV-1(77,116,151) had attenuated growth compared with that of the original HIV-1NL4-3 strain and strains containing mutations at both positions 75 and 77 (HIV-1(75,77,151) and HIV-1(75,77,116,15)). Sequence analysis of viral RNA and proviral DNA from several patients indicated that RT mutations developed in a sequential and cumulative pattern over the course of a 2- to 4-year observation period. The present results suggest that drug resistance and viral replicative capacity both may play a role in selection of HIV-1 RT mutations."
3156,0.004,4.0,"Many individuals chronically infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) experience a recrudescence of plasma virus during continuous combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) due either to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses or to poor compliance. In most cases, virologic failure on ART is associated with a coincident decline in CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels. However, a proportion of discordant individuals retain a stable or even increasing CD4(+) T lymphocyte count despite virological failure. In order to address the nature of these different outcomes, we evaluated virologic and immunologic variables in a prospective, single-blinded, nonrandomized cohort of 53 subjects with chronic HIV-1 infection who had been treated with continuous ART and monitored intensively over a period of 19 months. In all individuals with detectable viremia on ART, multiple drug resistance mutations with similar impacts on viral growth kinetics were detected in the pol gene of circulating plasma virus. Further, C2V3 env gene analysis demonstrated sequences indicative of CCR5 coreceptor usage in the majority of those with detectable plasma viremia. In contrast to this homogeneous virologic pattern, comprehensive screening with a range of antigens derived from HIV-1 revealed substantial immunologic differences. Discordant subjects with stable CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in the presence of recrudescent virus demonstrated potent virus-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. In contrast, subjects with virologic failure associated with declining CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts had substantially weaker HIV-specific CD4(+) T lymphocyte responses and exhibited a trend towards weaker HIV-specific CD8(+) T lymphocyte responses. Importantly the CD4(+) response was sustained over periods as long as 11 months, confirming the stability of the phenomenon. These correlative data lead to the testable hypothesis that the consequences of viral recrudescence during continuous ART are modulated by the HIV-specific cellular immune response."

2968,0.004,4.0,"Clinical observations suggest that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the Canadian Inuit are less often associated with serious adverse outcomes than has been described in other HBV-infected patient populations. The aim of this study was to document the clinical and biochemical features, liver-related morbidity and all-cause mortality in Canadian Inuit with chronic HBV infections. Administrative databases were reviewed for individuals identified as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive during a 1983-85 seroepidemiological survey of viral hepatitis in Baffin Island, Canada. An equal number of age- and gender-matched HBsAg-negative individuals from the same communities served as controls. Baseline HBV viral loads, genotypes and specific mutations were compared in HBsAg-positive survivors and nonsurvivors. A subset of surviving HBsAg-positive carriers were reassessed 25-30 years following their initial diagnosis for evidence of advanced liver disease and changes to their serological/virological findings. One hundred and forty four HBsAg-positive individuals were identified. All were Canadian Inuit. The mean age at diagnosis was 38 ± 17 years and 69 (61%) were male. Median follow-up was 23 years (range: 2-28 years). Viral quantitation from stored sera could be performed in 70 infected individuals. The median viral load was 4.3 log 10 IU/ml (range: 2.3-8.8 log 10 IU/ml), and all were genotype B, subgenotype B6. Liver biochemistry, morbidity and all-cause mortality rates were similar in HBsAg-positive carriers and controls. Following multivariate analyses, only age at diagnosis predicted mortality in HBsAg carriers. In a subset of 30 HBsAg-positive survivors who underwent follow-up assessments, clinical, biochemical and radiological examinations of the liver were essentially normal. 23/30 (77%) remained HBsAg positive and 17/19 (90%) HBV-DNA positive. The genotype and prevalence of genomic mutations in this cohort remained largely unchanged, but quantifiable viral loads were significantly lower (P < 0.003). The results of this study suggest that chronic HBV infections in the Canadian Inuit are infrequently associated with serious adverse outcomes. Whether this finding reflects unique features of the host, presence or absence of external factors that influence the course of HBV and/or intrinsic properties of the HBV B6 subgenotype remains to be determined."
7720,0.004,4.0,"This study was conducted in order to help determine the key factors that predict adherence to antiretroviral medications. A total of 115 HIV/AIDS patients who were having trouble adhering to their antiretroviral regimens completed face-to-face interviews in which adherence levels, medication side effects, mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics, substance use and health anxiety were assessed. Three measures of adherence were used: adherence over the past three days, adherence over the past week, and adherence over the past month. Logistic regression analyses indicated strongest prediction of three-day adherence, with mental health, social support, patient-provider relationship characteristics and side effects contributing to prediction. Past week adherence was associated with age and social support measures, and showed a marginal association with side effects. Past month adherence was less strongly predicted, with social support and alcohol use contributing to prediction. Thus, a variety of factors were found to determine adherence, and implications of the findings for adherence models and interventions are discussed."
4489,0.004,4.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with a high incidence of lymphoma. Typically, the lymphomas are B-cell in origin, and although they occur in the setting of HIV-1 infection, historical studies have found no evidence for the presence of HIV-1 within the transformed B-cells. We describe a new class of large cell lymphoma wherein HIV p24 expression within the tumor specimens was found to be extremely high. In the first case, HIV was expressed in the tumor-associated transformed T-cells. In three other cases, HIV was found to be highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages. These tumors exhibited a mixed immunophenotype histologically. Analysis by inverse polymerase chain reaction, using HIV long terminal repeat primers, demonstrated monoclonal HIV integration sites for all four tumors. Direct sequencing of the T-cell lymphoma inverse polymerase chain reaction products identified the HIV integration site within the fur gene, just upstream from the c-fes/fps protooncogene. Using segments of the fur gene as a probe, the other three monoclonal integration sites mapped to the same region. Although the integration and up-regulation of c-fes/fps was localized to the tumor cells within the T-cell lymphoma, the cells containing the monoclonal HIV in the other mixed immunophenotype lymphomas are currently unknown. These observations suggest that HIV may contribute directly to lymphomagenesis and identify a common site of HIV integration within a subset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome lymphoma."

Overall, spontaneous viral clearance rate is 10-25% and the only approach that can halt disease progression is hepatitis C virus (HCV) eradication by means of antiviral therapy. In non-haemophilic patients a single nucleotide polymorphism located upstream the gene of interferon lambda 3 (IFNλ3) has been associated with both spontaneous viral clearance and sustained virological response after antiviral treatment. The aim of this study was to assess whether the rs12979860 polymorphism was a predictor of spontaneous viral clearance and of sustained virological response after antiviral therapy in a large cohort of haemophilic patients with HCV infection. The rs12979860 polymorphism, defined as CC genotype or T allele, was tested in a cohort of 342 haemophilic patients and evaluated as predictor of spontaneous clearance or response to antiviral therapy. By multivariate regression analysis the IFNλ3 CC genotype was an independent predictor of spontaneous viral clearance (odds ratio: 3.7, 95% confidence interval: 2.0-6.8). Sustained virological response rates were doubled in patients with the CC genotype than in those with the T allele (78% vs 44%; p<0.001), especially in patients with HCV type 1 (67% vs 32%; p<0.001) and higher sustained response rates were observed in patients with the CC genotype who did not achieve rapid virological response (61% vs 30% in T allele patients; p=0.006).

After 3 months of treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in group B (23/35, 65.7%) than in group A (8/28, 28.5%) showed a > or = 1 log10 decrease in the plasma HIV RNA level (P = 0.0034). However, after 9-12 months, 12 of 23 (52.1%) group B responders showed viral load rebound. The results were partially explained by the finding that, at baseline, the great majority (21/27, 77.7%) of group A patients showed mutations conferring resistance to all drugs administered, whereas in group B patients' susceptibility to at least two drug classes was retained. However, after 9-12 months of therapy, most (18/20, 90%) of the short-term responders in group B showed emergence of additional mutations that hampered long-term response."
9566,0.004,4.0,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has become a major threat to the survival of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons in areas where antiretroviral therapy is available. In coinfection, viral eradication has been difficult to attain, and HCV therapy is underused. Novel therapies may be particularly beneficial for this population, yet studies lag behind those for HCV monoinfection. Increasingly, incident HCV among HIV-infected men who have sex with men is associated with sexual risk behavior further research should be performed to refine understanding of the causal mechanism of this association. The phenomenon of aggressive hepatic fibrogenesis when HIV infection precedes HCV acquisition requires longer-term observation to ensure optimal timing of HCV therapy. Medical management in coinfection will be improved by enhancing HCV detection, with annual serologic testing, screening with HCV RNA to detect acute infection, and HIV testing of HCV-infected individuals; by addressing HCV earlier in coinfected persons; and by universal consideration for HCV therapy. HCV drug trials in individuals coinfected with HIV should be expedited. HIV/HCV coinfection remains a growing and evolving epidemic; new developments in therapeutics and improved care models offer promise."

The HL-60 promyelocytic/myeloblastic cell line and the promonocytic line, U937, were susceptible to productive infection by monocytotropic HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1JR-FL and HTLV-IIIBa-L) after treatment with retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Virus production was only detected when these compounds were added before virus infection. Virus replication did not correlate with CD4 receptor expression because undifferentiated HL-60 cells express CD4 and the level of CD4 expression did not increase after differentiation in the presence of retinoic acid, 1,25(OH)2D3, or TPA. A mature monocytic cell line (THP-1) was capable of infection without pretreatment, and treatment with differentiating agents enhanced virus production. A chronically infected cell line (J-HL-60) was isolated after HIV-1JR-FL infection of HL-60 cells treated with retinoic acid. Virus production in this cell line was enhanced more than 10-fold after differentiation in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA. The majority of virus production by 1,25(OH)2D3-treated J-HL-60 cells was associated with the mature, adherent population. Molecular analysis of a cloned line of J-HL-60 showed integration of a single DNA provirus. These results suggest that cellular factors associated with precursor cell differentiation along the myelomonocytic pathway are required for optimal replication of monocytotropic HIV-1 strains in vitro."

After the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), these responses decay and the infected cell population that remains is commonly considered to be invisible to T-cells. We hypothesized that HIV antigen recognition may persist in ART-treated individuals due to low-level or episodic protein expression. We posited that if persistent recognition were occurring it would be preferentially directed against the early HIV gene products Nef, Tat, and Rev as compared to late gene products, such as Gag, Pol, and Env, which have higher barriers to expression. Using a primary cell model of latency, we observed that a Nef-specific CD8+ T-cell clone exhibited low-level recognition of infected cells prior to reactivation and robust recognition shortly thereafter. A Gag-specific CD8+ T-cell clone failed to recognized infected cells under these conditions, corresponding with a lack of detectable Gag expression. We measured HIV-specific T-cell responses in 96 individuals who had been suppressed on ART for a median of 7 years, and observed a significant, direct correlation between cell-associated HIV DNA levels and magnitudes of IFN-γ-producing Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cell responses. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort (n = 18). Correlations were not detected between measures of HIV persistence and T-cell responses to other HIV antigens. The correlation with Nef/Tat/Rev-specific T-cells was attributable to Nef-specific responses, the breadth of which also correlated with HIV DNA levels. These results suggest that ongoing Nef expression in ART-treated individuals drives preferential maintenance and/or expansion of T-cells reactive to this protein, implying sensing of infected cells by the immune system. The direct correlation, however, suggests that recognition does not result in efficient elimination of infected cells. These results raise the possibility that enhancing the cytolytic activity of Nef-specific T-cells may lead to reductions in infected cell frequencies, even in the absence of therapeutic latency reversal."
3996,0.004,4.0,"Non-detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) in a chronically HBV infected individual has been described as occult infection. One possible reason for this phenotype is alteration in large (L-HBsAg) to small (S-HBsAg) envelope protein ratio associated with reduced or non secretion of HBsAg. This results in quantitative levels of serum HBsAg below the detection limit of enzyme immunoassays. Genotype D of HBV has a characteristic 33 nucleotide (nt) deletion upstream of the pre-S2/S promoter. This deletion may reduce HBsAg secretion in occult infection patients infected with genotype D HBV. Additional deletions in the pre-S2/S promoter may further aggravate reduced HBsAg secretion in patients infected with genotype D HBV. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine the role of genotype D specific 33nt deletion and additional pre-S2/S promoter deletions in causing reduced or no secretion of HBsAg, in occult infection. Since these deletions overlap virus polymerase, their effect on virus replication was also investigated."

The World Health Organization projection model was used to make a short term projection of HIV infection and AIDS cases. Results show that the number estimated of HIV infected populations varies between 24 to 45,000 people by the year 1995. Results show also an estimated 8,500 cumulative AIDS cases.

1737,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are major causes of acute and chronic liver disease worldwide. Chronic infection with these viruses often leads to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis or primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Both HBV and HCV are bloodborne viruses; however, HBV is transmitted efficiently by both percutaneous and mucosal exposures, and HCV is transmitted predominantly by percutaneous exposures. Because the relative importance of various modes of transmission of these viruses differs by country, the choice of specific prevention and control strategies depends primarily on the epidemiology of infection in a particular country. Comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategies should include (1) prevention of perinatal HBV transmission, (2) hepatitis B vaccination at critical ages to interrupt transmission and (3) prevention of nosocomial HBV transmission. The prevention of hepatitis C is problematic because a vaccine to prevent HCV infection is not expected to be developed in the foreseeable future. From a global perspective, the greatest impact on the disease burden associated with HCV infection will most likely be achieved by focusing efforts on primary prevention strategies to reduce or eliminate the risk for transmission from nosocomial exposures (e.g. blood transfusion, unsafe injection practices) and high-risk practices (e.g. injecting drug use)."
7580,0.004,4.0,"The present study was designed to assess the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection among hospital employees, who often contract the infection before the beginning of their employment, and to suggest a prevention strategy. The study population consisted of 2518 subjects working or studying at the two Hadassah University hospitals, on Mount Scopus and at Ein Kerem in Jerusalem. The total prevalence for anti-HBc positivity as an indicator for past or present HBV infection was 17.6%. Several variables, including country of birth, age, and duration of employment significantly affected the rate of anti-HBc positivity. The highest rates for anti-HBc+ were found in personnel of selected departments such as haemodialysis (31.8%), haematology/oncology (28.3%), and the blood bank (24.0%), after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex. Specific occupations in the hospital were associated with an increased rate of anti-HBc positivity. Thus the highest rate of HBV infection (after adjustment for country of birth, age, and sex) was shown for housekeepers (32.4%) and departmental secretaries (23.6%), who take care of waste products containing blood, or who transfer vials containing blood to the hospital laboratories. By comparison, anti-HBc was positive in 17.2% of nurses, 15.6% of physicians, and only 7.8% of administrative clerks. Israel is a country of immigration, and anti-HBc rates were four times higher in employees born in countries where HBV is more endemic--for example, in north Africa and Mediterranean countries--than in employees born in western Europe or the United States. However, rate of anti-HBc + increased significantly with age as well as duration of employment in the hospital, irrespective of country of birth. These data indicate that although HBV infection often occurs in Israel before commencement of employment in the hospital, hospital employees are at significant risk for contracting HBV infection during their professional lifetime regardless of where they were born. Moreover, paramedical personnel such as housekeepers and departmental secretaries are in the highest risk group for contracting HBV. Finally, as a result of the high background of anti-HBC positivity in selected ethnic groups, mandatory screening for anti-HBc before employment in medical institutions in Israel is recommended for them, then active vaccination against HBV for employees at risk. Employees who immigrated from western Europe and the United States should be immunised without pre-vaccination screening for HBV."
20,0.004,4.0,"Despite the success of combined antiretroviral therapy in controlling viral replication in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, commonly referred to as neuroAIDS, remain a frequent and poorly understood complication. Infection of CD8(+) lymphocyte-depleted rhesus macaques with the SIVmac251 viral swarm is a well-established rapid disease model of neuroAIDS that has provided critical insight into HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder onset and progression. However, no studies so far have characterized in depth the relationship between intra-host viral evolution and pathogenesis in this model. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) env gp120 sequences were obtained from six infected animals. Sequences were sampled longitudinally from several lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, including individual lobes within the brain at necropsy, for four macaques; two animals were sacrificed at 21 days post-infection (p.i.) to evaluate early viral seeding of the brain. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses of the sequence data were used to ascertain viral population dynamics and gene flow between peripheral and brain tissues, respectively. A steady increase in viral effective population size, with a peak occurring at ~50-80 days p.i., was observed across all longitudinally monitored macaques. Phylogeographic analysis indicated continual viral seeding of the brain from several peripheral tissues throughout infection, with the last migration event before terminal illness occurring in all macaques from cells within the bone marrow. The results strongly supported the role of infected bone marrow cells in HIV/SIV neuropathogenesis. In addition, our work demonstrated the applicability of Bayesian phylogeography to intra-host studies in order to assess the interplay between viral evolution and pathogenesis. "
6487,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and its associated diseases continue to increase despite the progress in our understanding of HIV biology and the availability of a number of antiretroviral drugs. Adherence is a significant factor in the success of HIV therapy and current HIV treatment regimens require a combination of antiviral drugs to be taken at least daily for the remainder of a patient's life. A drug delivery system that allows sustained drug delivery could reduce the medical burden and costs associated with medication nonadherence. Here, we describe a novel supramolecular assembly or matrix that contains an anionic polymer hyaluronic acid, cationic polymer poly-l-lysine, and anionic oligosaccharide sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin. HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors Zidovudine and Lamivudine were successfully encapsulated into the polymer assembly in a noncovalent manner. The physicochemical properties and antiviral activity of the polymer assemblies were studied. The results of this study suggest that the supramolecular assemblies loaded with HIV drugs exert potent antiviral activity and allow sustained drug release. A novel drug delivery formulation such as the one described here could facilitate our efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infections and could be utilized in the design of therapeutic approaches for other diseases."

In fact, a proportion of people with sexual exposure to HIV remain uninfected despite multiple and continuous intercourse with HIV-infected partners. In this work, we have analyzed those virologic parameters potentially involved in the transmission of HIV through heterosexual contact. Thirty-eight couples with continuous unprotected sexual intercourse were included. HIV transmission occurred in 10 of 38 couples. No differences in clinical characteristics, exposure time, sexual practices, CD4 counts, or polymorphism in CCR5 were found between transmitter and nontransmitter groups. In contrast, virologic data were different between both groups; median values of viral load were 21.139 and 5.484 RNA copies/ml of plasma in the transmitter and nontransmitter groups, respectively, and a significant difference was found in mean viral load values (p = .03, Mann-Whitney test). Viral isolation was obtained in 90% of transmitters, but in only 44% of nontransmitter subjects (p = .02, Fisher's exact test). These data show that viral load levels and a positive viral isolation in culture must be considered as risk factors for heterosexual transmission of HIV-1."

295,0.004,4.0,"The emergence of resistance to lamivudine has been one of the major stumbling blocks to successful treatment and control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. The major mechanism of resistance has been attributed to the alteration in the YMDD motif of the HBV polymerase due to an amino acid change of rtM204 to V/I and an accompanying rtL180M conversion. A novel mutation pattern in a patient having clinical breakthrough under lamivudine therapy was discovered. The mutant had a rtL180C/M204I genotype and was detected after 2 years of therapy with lamivudine. To characterize this novel variant, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a vector construct containing the HBV genome. Transient transfection studies in human hepatoma cells with HBV carrying the new mutant demonstrated that the rtL180C/M204I mutant was resistant to lamivudine up to 10 microM. The resistance profile was comparable to that of the previously reported rtL180 M/M204I-containing virus. These observations were further confirmed by generation of stable cultures transfected with the mutant virus."

Postnatal growth failure and microcephaly, observed in a significant proportion of patients (46.7% and 30%, respectively), could be attributed to chronic illnesses and to progressive central nervous system lesions in HIV-infected patients. There were however, no significant differences between patients and controls with regard to the incidence of craniofacial features and dermatoglyphics, and the incidence of other anomalies was not different from that expected in the population. The patients born to drug-using mothers were not different from those born to non-drug-using mothers in relation to the studied criteria. We could not confirm the presence of characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism in children exposed to perinatal HIV infection."

4622,0.004,4.0,"The HIV epidemic is a significant global health care issue. With increasing knowledge and improved therapeutics the natural history of the infection has been modified. In this paper we aim to present the general socio-demographic profile and the clinical and therapeutic spectrum of patients with HIV infection who have visited the Bayamón Health Care facilities over the last 12 years and who are part of the Retrovirus Research Center (RRC). The objectives of the study are: 1) describe changes in the demographic, risk factors and clinical stage of patients with HIV infection initially seen in our center; 2) assess changing trends from the clinical and immunological perspective across time; 3) describe mortality risk of patients particularly after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This is a cross-sectional study of 3,569 patients admitted to the RRC at the Universidad Central del Caribe between years 1992 through 2005. The variables studied were demographic, risk factors exposure, HIV status at baseline, clinical and immunological parameters, ART and the mortality risk. Chi square with Cramer's coefficient, Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazard ratio analysis were performed. The study revealed that individuals presenting at our health care facilities are older and that the proportion of females has increased. The risk factor profile shows increase in heterosexual contact with the disease. The study found that patients treated with ART had significantly lower mortality risk than those without ART. Patients who arrive to RRC with AIDS and Intravenous Drug Users (IDU) had a higher mortality risk than participants with HIV. The analysis of the trends showed changes in the demographic and clinical profile of patients across the years.

Isolates of C. albicans were obtained from 45 patients with HIV infection during the progression of their disease and differentiated using two methods. The first utilized the morphological characteristics of colonies, and the second method utilized a small portion of C. albicans DNA as a probe on Southern-transferred, EcoRI-digested C. albicans genomic DNA. In 67% of the patients a single strain of C. albicans, as determined by the DNA analysis, was isolated from each individual. The phenotypic expression of the genetically identical strains varied considerably over the experimental period with one morphotype being predominant. These results showed that the genotype of C. albicans persisted in the majority of HIV-infected individuals, but that the phenotypical expression of this strain changed. A novel finding in this study was that 18 strains of C. albicans had DNA which did not hybridize to the probe used."
9965,0.004,4.0,"HCV and HIV co-infection is associated with accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection, and liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality among HIV-infected patients. New insights have revealed multiple mechanisms by which HCV and HIV lead to accelerated disease progression, specifically that HIV infection increases HCV replication, augments HCV-induced hepatic inflammation, increases hepatocyte apoptosis, increases microbial translocation from the gut and leads to an impairment of HCV-specific immune responses. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral therapy and treatment of HCV have independently been shown to delay the progression of fibrosis and reduce complications from end-stage liver disease among co-infected patients. However, rates of sustained virologic response with PEG-IFN and ribavirin have been significantly inferior among co-infected patients compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, and treatment uptake has remained low given the limited efficacy and tolerability of current HCV regimens. With multiple direct-acting antiviral agents in development to treat HCV, a unique opportunity exists to redefine the treatment paradigm for co-infected patients, which incorporates data on fibrosis stage as well as potential drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy.

2873,0.004,4.0,"The HAART therapy has improved life expectancy enabling long latency conditions caused by the hepatitis viruses that became the leading cause of death in HIV infected patients. In this study a group of 300 patients aged from 18 to 63 years were selected in order to assess the prevalence and consequences of HIV and the hepatitis B (HBV), C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses coinfections. Study groups were designed for each coinfection. These groups were in turn divided in case groups formed of coinfected participants and control groups consisting of mono-infected participants. This classification was obtained by testing the participants for the presence of specific infection markers using the ELISA technique. As a result, in regard to the HIV/HBV coinfection the study group consisted of 16 coinfected participants and 114 HBV-infected participants resulting in a prevalence of the coinfection of 14%. In the case of the HIV/HDV coinfection the study group consisted of 5 coinfected participants and 45 HDV-infected participants. The prevalence of the HIV/HCV coinfection was 25% out of the 170 HCV-infected participants. The effect of the coinfections on the expression and levels of the infection markers was analyzed in constrast to those encountered in the case of the mono-infection. The observed changes in the expression of the specific hepatitis markers indicate the impact of the coinfection with HIV on the progression of the hepatitis infections. In addition, the inadequate immune response towards the hepatitis viruses in the case of the coinfected participants leads to the development of cirrhosis and end stage liver disease."

Initially described in patients treated with SMX-TMP for PCP, allergy is now known to involve a multitude of drugs. The pathogenesis of, and risk factors for, allergy in HIV infection are poorly understood, although there is evidence suggesting that allergy is more common with advancing immunodeficiency. HIV-negative subjects with sulfonamide allergy may have drug-specific antibodies and drug metabolite-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity, abnormalities that could partly explain the allergic mechanisms and which may have future diagnostic potential; these abnormalities have not been described in HIV-infected subjects. Therapy includes avoidance, suppressive agents such as corticosteroids, and desensitization, although the appropriate role for each is not entirely clear. Serum IgE levels have been shown to rise with progressive disease; those patients with higher levels may have a worse prognosis. The mechanisms of this rise are multifactorial, probably a combination of altered T-lymphocyte regulation of IgE synthesis and of production of specific IgE directed against microbial antigens."

We assessed 244 HIV-positive participants in an HIV intervention targeting drug users (1997-99). Fifty-seven per cent of HIV-positive participants reported unprotected sex within the past 90 days, 16.4% with serodiscordant partners. Odds of risky sex were lower among those currently receiving HIV medical care (odds ratio (OR)=0.36), and were greater among females (OR=2.6), those having friends with lower norms of condom use (OR=3.3), and those having a main sexual partner (OR=6.2). Lower odds of receiving HIV medical care were associated with current drug use (OR=0.33), sharing drugs with a sex partner (OR=0.27), and exchanging sex for drugs or money (OR=0.24).

Six men had high rates of CD4+ T-cell loss, and eight men had low rates of CD4+ T-cell loss over 2.5 to 8 years of infection. We found that V1-V2 and V4-V5 env populations changed dramatically over time in all 14 subjects; the changes in these regions were significantly correlated with each another over time. The subjects with rapid CD4 loss had significantly less change in their env populations than the subjects with slow CD4 loss. The two subjects with rapid CD4 loss and sustained low CD4 counts (<150/microl for at least 2 years) showed stabilization of their V1-V2 and V4-V5 populations as reflected by low levels of total change in HTA pattern and low HTA indices (a novel measure of the emergence of new bands and band distribution); this stabilization was not observed in other subjects. The stabilization of env variant populations at low CD4 counts following periods of rapid viral evolution suggests that selective pressure on env, likely from new immune responses, is minimal when CD4 counts drop dramatically and remain low for extended periods of time."

This study compares the level of satisfaction of physicians reporting their experience with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) testing with the satisfaction levels of those physicians reporting their experience with hepatitis B virus (HBV) testing. By mail, 6,570 licensed San Diego County physicians were surveyed. Among those who tested for HIV-1 or HBV, their satisfaction with four different HIV-1 or HBV testing parameters was assessed: 1) specimen submission process, 2) test accuracy, 3) clarity of test report, and 4) turnaround time. Overall, physician satisfaction with both HIV-1 and HBV testing was high, particularly for test accuracy (means of 2.79 and 2.84, respectively on a 3-point scale), although slightly lower for turnaround time (means of 2.40 and 2.43, respectively). Mean satisfaction with the specimen submission process and test accuracy were higher for physicians who ordered HBV tests than for those who ordered HIV-1 tests. Satisfaction with the four HIV-1 testing process parameters varied significantly by physician specialty, practice type, and type of laboratory used. For HBV testing, significant differences were observed only for turnaround time. For both HIV-1 and HBV testing, those who received a final interpretation of laboratory results were more satisfied with test report clarity than those who did not. Although physician satisfaction with HIV-1 and HBV testing is high, this study identifies the least satisfied groups and specific areas in the testing process than may need improvement."

We present the largest survey on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) resistance among treatment-naïve and experienced patients followed in small, relatively underprivileged cities in Brazil with universal availability to standard of care antiretroviral combinations. Samples were collected between 2004 and 2006 from 95 patients followed in the cities of Saquarema and Santo Antonio de Pádua, state of Rio de Janeiro. A proviral fragment encompassing protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) regions was generated and drug susceptibility level was inferred. Among 50 strains from drug-naïve subjects, one (2%) had intermediate-level resistance to RT inhibitors. Among 38 patients on therapy as of sampling, 28 (73.7%) had plasma viral load (PVL) below detection limit (26 of whom without evidence of resistance mutations) and 11 (28.9%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility. Only two strains harbored both protease and RT inhibitor mutations. Among seven patients who were off-treatment as of sampling, two (28.5%) harbored strains with reduced susceptibility to RT inhibitors. The relatively high frequency of undetectable PVL among patients on treatment and the overall low prevalence of resistance-associated mutations are reassuring.

Production was detected by using an HIV p24 antigen ELISA assay in blood mononuclear cells in 54% of asymptomatic, 71% of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related complex, and 100% of AIDS patients. When the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated into monocytes and CD4+ T cells, we found that the CD4+ T-cell fraction was preferentially infected in the three clinical stages. The ability to isolate HIV from blood monocyte-derived macrophages was similar in the three stages (24-33%) and required coculture with phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoblasts. Bone marrow and blood mononuclear cells cultured simultaneously yielded virus from both sources in 13 individuals. Again the prime source of virus was the nonadherent bone marrow mononuclear cells, which contained CD4+ T cells, and not the adherent monocyte-enriched fraction. We conclude that blood mononuclear cells yield productive virus more readily as disease progresses and that infection is detected in association with CD4+ T-cell-enriched fractions. In our large sample of patients, monocyte infection was detected in only a small fraction, suggesting that this cell type is neither a primary nor an exclusive reservoir of HIV infection."

Random multistage cluster sampling was used to select persons 13-69 years of age. Markers for HBV were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The HBV genotypes were determined by sequencing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Multivariate analyses and simple catalytic model were performed. Overall, 7,881 persons were included; < 70% were not vaccinated. Positivity for HBsAg was less than 1% among non-vaccinated persons and genotypes A, D, and F co-circulated. The incidence of infection increased with age with similar force of infection in all regions. Males and persons having initiated sexual activity were associated with HBV infection in the two settings; healthcare jobs and prior hospitalization were risk factors in the Federal District.

We performed UDPS on reverse transcriptase (RT) from 47 HIV-1 individuals, naive of antiretroviral treatment and for whom genotypic resistance testing was requested for clinical management in 2011-2012. In 8.5% of the patients, only low-frequency variants harboring RT drug resistance mutations were detected raising the question of their clinical significance.

Assessments included patient-reported Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory, SF-12v2 Quality of Life assessment, HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, and HIV Symptom Index Questionnaire through Week 48. Additional evaluations included study drug discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A total of 786 participants (n=394 RPV/FTC/TDF, n=392 EFV/FTC/TDF) were included. Fewer RPV/FTC/TDF-treated than EFV/FTC/TDF-treated participants discontinued study drug due to TEAEs (2.5% vs. 8.7%), with 41% (14/34) TEAE-related discontinuations in the EFV/FTC/TDF group occurring within the first four weeks of treatment. Treatment adherence and satisfaction remained high through Week 48 and quality of life improved from baseline in both groups. There were no significant between-group differences in virologic success (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) regardless of adherence (<95% or ≥95%). Significant between-group differences favouring RPV/FTC/TDF were observed for the HIV SIQ symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep (p = .022) and diarrhea or loose bowel movements (p = .002). In conclusion, 48-week treatment with RPV/FTC/TDF or EFV/FTC/TDF was associated with high adherence, high treatment satisfaction, and improved quality of life. TEAE-related discontinuations and patient-reported symptoms indicate that RPV/FTC/TDF may be somewhat better tolerated than EFV/FTC/TDF. "
5437,0.004,4.0,"In Thailand, the combined generic anti-retroviral drug stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (d4T/3TC/NVP) has been used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals since 2001. Due to relatively frequent adverse effects, d4T gradually has been replaced with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although the frequency of adverse drug effects with TDF is lower than that with d4T, TDF is known to induce kidney dysfunction, especially in the proximal tubules. It has been reported that renal tubular transporters, including members of the multi-drug resistant (MDR) protein family, are implicated in tenofovir extrusion and may, therefore, confer susceptibility to TDF-induced kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD). We have explored the association between KTD and polymorphisms in genes that encode adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC)-type MDRs."
3107,0.004,4.0,"Population-wide variation in genomic RNA of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encompassing the V3 loop of the envelope protein was studied in serum samples of 74 newly infected individuals from three Dutch cohorts: 30 homosexual men, 32 drug users, and 12 hemophiliacs. During acute infection, HIV-1 RNA sequences present in serum are relatively homogeneous, which makes direct sequencing feasible. This offered an opportunity to study the infecting virus variants before mutations had accumulated in the new host. The sampling dates ranged from 1980 to 1991, thus spanning the entire AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands. The diversity in the sequenced region increased over time in both the homosexual and the drug-user risk groups. Furthermore, this increase was associated with an increase in antigenic variation, as witnessed by serum reactivity to a V3 peptide panel. Despite this diversification, some 1990 sequences still closely resembled the earliest 1980 sequence, making ancestral inferences problematic. No evidence was found of a change in the master sequence of the virus quasi-species over time. At the amino acid level, no risk-group-associated variation was found, but at the nucleotide level, the drug-user and homosexual/hemophiliac sequences could be distinguished on the basis of a single silent nucleotide change in the sequence encoding the tip of the V3 loop. Hemophiliac sequences could not be distinguished from those of homosexuals. In spite of the large and increasing genetic variability, all sequences were more similar to the European/American HIV consensus sequence than to that of non-Western strains."

The current study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and its associated risk factors among hemodialysis patients from five hemodialysis centers in Tabriz, a Northwestern Iranian city. Hepatitis B serologic markers were evaluated in chronic hemodialysis patients. Patients (n = 412) were divided into two groups: Group 1--patients with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Group 2--patients with negative HBsAg. The median age was 54.9 years (range, 13-90 years). Thirteen patients (3.2%) were found to be positive for HBsAg. Among the studied factors, the history of war injury was significantly associated with the risk of HBV infection (P = 0.023). In conclusion, our study shows that the risk of HBV infection among Tabrizian hemodialysis patients is a factor of dialysis-independent parameters."

A key factor in the effectiveness of ART is good adherence to the prescribed regimen for both individual well-being and public health. Poor adherence can contribute to the emergence of drug resistant strains of the virus and transmission during risky behaviors. Increased access to ART in low-income country settings has contributed to an interest in treatment adherence in resource-poor contexts. This study aims to investigate the proportion of adherence to ART and identify possible factors related to non-adherence to ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Lao PDR."
7586,0.004,4.0,"The aim of the study was to identify high-risk groups and the determinants of late HIV diagnosis in France in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), from January 1996 to June 2005. Informations were collected from an electronic medical record of all HIV- 1-infected patients who sought care in six HIV reference centers in France, constituting a prospective multicentric cohort. Patients were defined as ""late testers"" if they had presented with either symptoms of clinical AIDS or a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm(3) during the year of diagnosis, as ""nonlate"" if their CD4 count was above 200, and as ""unknown"" if CD4 cell count in the year at the time of diagnosis was not documented. Among the 4516 patients available for analysis, the percentage of late testing was 38% (n = 1718) and decreased after 2003 (31.5% in 2004-2005). This percentage was higher in heterosexual men (48.2%) than in homosexual men (31.7%) or heterosexual women (32.6%) and was higher for patients older than 30. Heterosexual men living in a couple with children had a higher risk of late testing (odds ratio [OR] = 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 to 2.66), while heterosexual women in a couple without children had a lower risk (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25 to 0.83). Among homosexual men, unemployment was associated with late testing (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.14 to 4.36). The proportion of late testing was still high. Groups classically identified as low risk for HIV infection, particularly heterosexual men in a couple with children, were found to be at high risk for late testing. It seems necessary to improve HIV testing policy in the heterosexual population."

Therefore, it is important to know the attitudes of midwives' and nurses' towards people living with HIV/AIDS. The aim of this descriptive and cross-sectional study is to assess the attitudes of Turkish midwives and nurses working at hospitals to people living with HIV/AIDS and to identify factors that affect these attitudes. A group of 46 midwives and 192 nurses working in hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected through AIDS Attitude Scale. Age, professional experience, number of children and marital status influenced the attitudes of the participants towards people living with HIV/AIDS. We concluded that higher level of education appear to positively influence the attitudes of the participants. Education programmes including evidence-based nursing implications might be planned to improve positive attitudes and to prevent stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS."
8911,0.004,4.0,"To elucidate needlestick transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), strains isolated from 1 physician who acquired HBV infection through a needlestick accident and 3 patients with chronic hepatitis B (donor patients A, B, and C) were tested using molecular evolutionary analysis based on full-length HBV genomic sequences. Nucleotide sequences of these isolates were aligned with 55 previously reported full-length genomic sequences. Genetic distances were estimated using the 6-parameter method, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Strains isolated from patient A and the recipient pair were clustered within a closer range of evolutionary distances than were strains recovered from the recipient pair and patients B and C. Furthermore, strains from patient A and the recipient were also clustered on the S gene sequences of HBV. These results demonstrated that patient A alone was the source of direct transmission to the recipient. This approach can be used to investigate the transmission route of HBV."
3809,0.004,4.0,"Occult Hepatitis B Infection (OBI) is a form of chronic HBV infection characterized by low level HBV DNA, without detectable HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). OBI is frequently associated with the presence of anti-HBc and in some cases also with anti-HBs. Patients, who formerly received non-inactivated factor concentrates, can potentially be considered at high risk for OBI, especially since these patients usually are HIV or HCV co-infected. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection in Greek patients with hereditary bleeding disorders. The study sample comprised of 114 patients from a single haemophilia center. All patients were screened for HBV serum markers and individually tested for HBV DNA using a qualitative PCR. Presence of HBV DNA was further confirmed by quantification of viral load with an ultrasensitive in-house real time PCR. 88 and 21 patients with haemophilia A and B, respectively, 4 patients with von Willebrand Disease and 1 patient with severe factor VII deficiency were screened for the presence of OBI. Anti-HBc were detected in 53 (46.5%) subjects; 18 of them were anti-HBs(-) and 35 anti-HBs(+). Anti-HBe were present in 26 subjects. Two out of 114 patients were HBsAg(+). Of the remaining 112 HBsAg(-) patients tested, two (1.8%) were found HBsAg(-), HBV DNA(+), anti-HBc(+) and anti-HBs(-) and were identified as potential OBI cases. Both cases exhibited very low DNA levels; 38.2IU/mL in patient A and 14.2IU/mL in patient B. Both patients were HBeAg(-), but patient A had HBe antibodies. Patient B was also HIV/HCV co-infected. In conclusion, two cases of OBI with low HBV viraemia were identified among patients with congenital bleeding disorders. Although the incidence in our sample is moderately low (1.8%), close monitoring of these infections is of great clinical significance, especially in patients with co-infections and concomitant immunosuppression."
4771,0.004,4.0,"During 4 year period between April 1990 and March 1994, 4120 specimens from the patients attending out patient departments of Medical, Surgical and Antenatal units of a major city hospital were tested for HIV infection as a part of an on-going sentinel surveillance programme. In addition, 1440 specimens from the patients attending STD clinic of the same hospital and 862 females seeking termination of pregnancy from a near by hospital were included for comparison. It was found that only 3 individuals with high risk behaviours out of 2002 females attending antenatal clinic showed evidence of HIV infection (rate 1.49 per 1000). The corresponding rate for the group of patients attending STD clinic and seeking termination of pregnancy were 3 out of 1440 (rate 2.15 per 1000) and 1 out of 862 (rate 1.16 per 1000) respectively. It was noted that prevalence of HIV infection in the hospital attending population with unspecified risk factor (medical, surgical and antenatal clinics) was not a matter of serious concern. The importance of finding out risk factors in females attending antenatal clinic is evident from the study."

Thus, a therapy that specifically reduces HBsAg serum levels could be used in combination therapy with nucleos(t)ide drugs or permit therapeutic vaccination for the treatment of HBV infection. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel triazolo-pyrimidine inhibitors (1, 3, and 4) of HBsAg cellular secretion, with activity against drug-resistant HBV variants. Extensive SAR led to substantial improvements in the EC(50) of the parent compound, 5 (HBF-0259), with the best being 3c, with EC(50) = 1.4 ± 0.4 μM, SI ≥ 36. The lead candidates, both 1a (PBHBV-001) and 3c (PBHBV-2-15), were well-tolerated in both normal and HBV-transgenic mice and exhibited acceptable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability in Sprague-Dawley rats."
6962,0.004,4.0,"This study aimed to investigate the correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related discrimination among general practitioners. The survey, conducted in 1993-1994, covered a random sample of 878 general practitioners from six of the 12 New South Wales health areas, augmented by 44-general practitioners from the same areas who were antiretroviral drug prescribers. The response rate was 51 per cent, and the final usable sample was 451. Variables examined were: demographic characteristics, the number of HIV-infected patients, personal contact with people living with HIV or AIDS, personal contact with homosexuals, the degree of anxiety about HIV or AIDS, and the degree of HIV-related discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes among general practitioners decreased as contact with HIV-infected patients (P < 0.001), other people living with HIV or AIDS (P < 0.001), and homosexuals (P < 0.001) increased. Anxiety about HIV or AIDS also decreased as contact increased (P < 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were strongly associated with higher levels of HIV-related discrimination (P < 0.001). The demographic correlates of discrimination among general practitioners were the same as those found in the wider population. The professional care of people living with HIV and AIDS was concentrated among a small number of general practitioners, many of whom were homosexual. Ten general practitioners were carrying extraordinarily high caseloads of over 200 HIV-infected patients each. Older, heterosexual and male general practitioners are an important target for education campaigns, and the professional care of people living with HIV or AIDS should be encouraged among a wider group of general practitioners."

In this study, the genotype frequency of two IL28B SNPs (rs129679860 and rs8099917) in a cohort of chronic HCV-monoinfected patients in Brazil was evaluated and the SNP sufficient to predict the treatment response outcome was determined. A total of 66 naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV-infected patients were genotyped and the associated viral kinetics and SVR were assessed. The overall SVR was 38%. Both the viral kinetics and SVR were associated with rs129679860 genotypes (CC = 62% vs. CT = 33% vs. TT = 18%, p = 0.016). However, rs8099917 genotypes were only associated with SVR (TT = 53% vs. TG = 33% vs. GG = 18%; p = 0.032).

This case-control study was carried out to detect whether apoptosis genes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confer risk to HCV in a cohort of Egyptian patients and to explore their association with viral load. One hundred and ninety six blood samples were withdrawn from 96 HCV patients and 100 controls. The Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) -1525G>A and FasL-844T>C SNPs were genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Hepatitis C viral load was measured using Real time PCR. Results Genotypes distributions of TRAIL -1525G>A and FasL-844 T>C polymorphisms in controls were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The study showed a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the TRAIL -1525G>A polymorphism genotypes and the FasL-844 T>C polymorphism genotypes between the HCV patients and the controls (p=0.001 and 0.02 respectively), with association of the -1525GA genotype and -844 TT genotype with increased risk of HCV infection (OR=2.68, 1.942 respectively, 95% CI=1.482-4.846, 1.1-3.43, respectively). No significant association was detected between TRAIL, FasL and the viral load. Our results suggest that the FasL -844T>C SNP is implicated in the susceptibility to HCV in Egyptian patients and firstly report the involvement of TRAIL gene polymorphism in the risk of the disease. Therefore we recommend national programs to delineate genetic factors that may put individuals at risk for contracting HCV."

5007,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can slow down the replication of HIV-1, leading to an improvement in the survival of HIV-1-infected patients. However, drug toxicities and poor drug administration has led to the emergence of a drug-resistant strain. HIV-1 immunotherapy has been continuously developed, but antibody therapy and HIV vaccines take time to improve its efficiency and have limitations. HIV-1-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based immunotherapy founded on neutralizing antibodies is now being developed. In HIV-1 therapy, anti-HIV chimeric antigen receptors showed promising data in the suppression of HIV-1 replication; however, autologous transfusion is still a problem. This has led to the development of effective peptides and proteins for an alternative HIV-1 treatment. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of potent anti-HIV-1 peptides and proteins that reveal promising therapeutic activities. The inhibitory mechanisms of each therapeutic molecule in the different stages of the HIV-1 life cycle will be discussed herein."

Although these aneurysms have important clinical implications, their etiology and optimal therapy are unknown. We present a systematic review of diffuse intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy in patients who are HIV-positive. We conducted a comprehensive literature search for relevant case reports and reviews published before February 2009. Patients were included if they had HIV infection and radiographic imaging consistent with fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy. We identify 11 published adult cases of intracranial fusiform aneurysmal vasculopathy and describe 1 unpublished case from our own institution. Available data regarding clinical presentation, characteristic imaging findings, and treatment of this complex syndrome are reviewed. Adults with HIV-associated intracranial aneurysmal vasculopathy typically are significantly immunosuppressed and present with gross neurologic dysfunction. Characteristic radiographic findings include diffuse cerebral fusiform aneurysms with hemorrhage or infarct. Treatment of any active infection followed by the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and corticosteroids may be a reasonable approach in this complex syndrome."
6525,0.004,4.0,"During the routine care of patients, pulmonary and critical care specialist may have significant exposure to respiratory infections and potentially infectious body fluids such as blood and pleural fluid. Bronchoscopy and intensive care services often require close contact with patients and the use of sharp devices required for intravascular catheterization. Rendering such care places physicians at risk for acquiring agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis viruses, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As of December 1998, 188 cases of occupational transmission of HIV to health care workers (HCWs) in the United States have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control. Most documented cases of seroconversion involve percutaneous injury involving blood, with the greatest risks being associated with injury from a hollow-bore needle that has been in an infected patient's vein or artery. Because thousands of HIV-infected persons are unaware of their infection, HCWs must consider all patients to be infected with HIV and improve work practices accordingly. Nevertheless, elimination of all exposures is impossible, and postexposure prophylaxis with combination antiretroviral therapy is recommended for persons deemed a high risk of contracting HIV. Pulmonary specialists are at high risk of exposure to tuberculosis; proper precautions include isolation of patients with suspected tuberculosis and the use of DMF-HEPA respirator masks, especially while performing procedures like bronchoscopy. Contaminated bronchoscopes have been implicated in transmission and ""pseudoinfection"" of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning and disinfection practices."

Swedish samples were used as reference material. The Ethiopian HIV-1+ subjects were found to have significantly increased TNF-alpha and neopterin, but not IFN-alpha levels. Increased levels of TNF-alpha and neopterin were frequently found in Ethiopian asymptomatic subjects (37% and 47%), and the concentration increased in patients with AIDS (83% and 90% respectively). The levels of the two substances and the proportion of patients with higher TNF-alpha values were lower in the corresponding Swedish subjects. The proportion of sera with raised levels of IFN-alpha was very low (asymptomatic 4%, and AIDS 7%) in Ethiopian subjects. These results suggest a very early increase in the TNF-alpha production and activation of the cellular immune response, and a low level of IFN-alpha synthesis in the natural course of HIV infection in Ethiopia. The aberrations may contribute to a rapid progress of immunodeficiency and cachexia often seen in Ethiopian patients."

The Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN) (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00146419) is a prospective observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults. At baseline, comprehensive data were collected, including cystatin C and measures of renal function. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with baseline renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) calculated using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation] and elevated cystatin C (>1.0 mg/liter) in a cross-sectional analysis. Among 670 subjects with complete data (mean age 41 years, mean CD4 cell count 530 cells/mm(3), 79% prescribed cART), the mean eGFR was 96.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Forty percent of subjects had renal dysfunction; 3.3% had chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Elevated cystatin C was present in 18% of subjects. In multivariate analysis, renal dysfunction was associated with older age, non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, higher cystatin C levels, and current prescription of ritonavir. Factors associated with elevated cystatin C included hepatitis C coinfection, hypertension, current smoking, older age, current tenofovir use, detectable plasma HIV RNA, and elevated microalbuminuria. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was low in this contemporary HIV cohort. However, mild to moderate renal dysfunction was common despite the widespread use of cART."

The influence of AIDS-related education and the experience of caring for affected patients on health visitors' knowledge of the disease was assessed. The attitudes of carers towards these patients were also ascertained. All heath visitors (n = 88) working in the Merton and Sutton Community Healthcare Trust were invited to participate in a questionnaire survey. Fifty-five health visitors participated. Knowledge relating to HIV and AIDS was good, but the majority of respondents felt they did not have all the information they needed about HIV and AIDS. Almost one-quarter of respondents had cared for a client who was either HIV positive or had AIDS. Overall, the findings were quite encouraging. However, further education, training, and support were identified as necessary. These shortfalls need to be addressed in order to fully assist health visitors in their role of caring for clients and families affected by HIV and AIDS."

Findings indicated that, after accounting for negative affectivity and ART side-effect severity, distress tolerance was significantly associated with pill count adherence as well as viral load. Specifically, a differential association was observed whereby self-reported distress tolerance was associated with pill count adherence, whereas behavioral distress tolerance was associated with viral load. Importantly, no associations were observed between either measure of distress tolerance and CD4 count. Findings are discussed in terms of the importance of both behavioral and perceived distress tolerance assessment among patients with HIV as well as potential clinical implications related to the integration of distress tolerance-focused treatments into existing interventions for individuals with HIV."

After a year of acrimonious debate over the proper approach to the issues discussed in Behringer, no consensus has emerged. The Centers for Disease Control has quietly abandoned its plan to ease its July 1991 guidelines that call for infected professionals to cease performing invasive procedures or disclose their conditions to their patients. It has now decided to let each state set its own rules and regulations in compliance with its guidelines, or risk financial penalties. The issues discussed in Behringer have remained controversial.

5827,0.004,4.0,"A patient with HIV infection who experienced immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [increase in CD4 T cell count from <1/microl to >600/microl] presented with severe Graves' disease 32 months after commencing HAART. A comprehensive clinical and laboratory study demonstrated pronounced regional lymphadenopathy and thymic enlargement at presentation, and that the onset of thyrotropin receptor antibody production was associated with increased production of soluble CD30 (a marker of type 2 immune responses). Blood naive CD8 T cell counts and TREC levels in both CD4 and CD8 T cells were increased at multiple time points compared with carefully selected controls. We conclude that the Graves' disease in this patient was associated with abnormally high blood counts of thymus-derived T cells, and propose that Graves' disease after HAART in this and other HIV patients may result from failure to delete autoreactive T cell clones in the regenerating thymus."
6322,0.004,4.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection is characterized by chronic immune activation and progressive loss of CD4+ T cells, leading to a wide array of immune dysfunction, particularly involving immune response directed against viral antigens. HIV-1 encodes for fifteen proteins, which might serve as a target for immune recognition. Immune response to the envelope proteins have been studied more due to their presence on the surface of the virus. Recent studies on HIV vaccine development have focused on the Gag and Pol proteins. The transactivator Tat and Rev proteins have also been the focus of immunization studies due to their potent regulatory activity. The Tat (transactivator of transcription) protein although being nuclear in localization is also released from infected cells and acts on uninfected cells. Extracellular Tat seems to play an important role in AIDS pathogenesis. Furthermore, a correlation has been found between anti-Tat immune response and slow progression of the disease. Although several studies have shown Tat as a potential vaccine candidate with encouraging results, there are also reports raising doubt about its efficacy in multi-component HIV vaccine strategy. Here, we have addressed the issue of immune response to the most indispensable HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat."
7311,0.004,4.0,"Hepatitis B virus infection is highly endemic in China, especially in rural areas such as Dianjiang County with poor-quality health care and little local HBV information. Therefore, for the first time, the present study was carried out to investigate the molecular epidemiology, phylogeny and population dynamics of HBV based on 146 HBV-infected patients. A 435-bp portion of the HBV S region was sequenced, and the phylogeny was reconstructed, indicating that three genotypes, B, C and D of HBV were distributed in Dianjiang County. The predominant genotype is B (67.12 %), followed by C (32.19 %) and D (0.68 %). Patient demographic information and clinical outcomes were examined by genotypes, and no significant association was found. Population dynamics analysis suggested that both genotype B and C have experienced a tenfold expansion during the last five years for reasons that are unclear. Thus, a thorough molecular epidemiology investigation is strongly recommended in the future. "
4193,0.004,4.0,"The most common first-line, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) received by individuals infected with HIV-1 in Cameroon is the combination therapy Triomune, comprised of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one non-NRTI (NNRTI). To examine the efficacy of these drugs in Cameroon, where diverse non-B HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant viruses predominate, the reverse transcriptase (RT) viral sequences in patient plasma were analyzed for the presence of mutations that confer drug resistance. Forty-nine HIV-1-positive individuals were randomly selected from those receiving care in HIV/AIDS outpatient clinics in the South-West and North-West Regions of Cameroon. Among the 28 patients receiving HAART, 39% (11/28) had resistance to NRTIs, and 46% (13/28) to NNRTIs after a median of 12 months from the start of therapy. Among those with drug-resistance mutations, there was a median of 14 months from the start of HAART, versus 9 months for those without; no difference was observed in the average viral load (10,997 copies/ml vs. 8,056 copies/ml). In contrast, drug-naïve individuals had a significantly higher average viral load (27,929 copies/ml) than those receiving HAART (9,527 copies/ml). Strikingly, among the 21 drug-naïve individuals, 24% harbored viruses with drug-resistance mutations, suggesting that HIV-1 drug-resistant variants are being transmitted in Cameroon. Given the high frequency of resistance mutations among those on first-line HAART, coupled with the high prevalence of HIV-1 variants with drug-resistance mutations among drug-naïve individuals, this study emphasizes the need for extensive monitoring of resistance mutations and the introduction of a second-line HAART strategy in Cameroon."
2417,0.004,4.0,"We conducted a community-based study of the prevalence and correlates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and immunization among young adults in a ""drug supermarket"" neighborhood in New York City. Four hundred eighty-nine young adults ages 18-24 years were recruited from Bushwick, Brooklyn through multistage household probability sampling (n = 332) and targeted sampling (n = 157), interviewed, and tested for three hepatitis B markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs). Serological evidence of HBV infection was found in 8.0% (6.0% in the household sample and 12.1% in the targeted sample) and of hepatitis B immunization in 19.6% (22.6% in the household sample and 13.4% in the targeted sample). HBV infection was higher among young adults who either used crack or injected drugs and among those who traded sex for money or drugs. Having Medicaid was significantly associated with lower odds of infection in the household sample and higher odds of immunization in the targeted sample. Although adolescent hepatitis B immunization has been a public health priority in the United States since 1995, nearly three-quarters of young adults in this community did not have serological evidence of being either exposed or immunized. Whereas subsequent younger generations benefited from universal childhood hepatitis B immunization, this particular cohort of young adults who live in communities like Bushwick presents a unique group for prevention intervention."

In 2013, the WHO revised its recommendations for initiating ART among people living with HIV (PLHIV) by increasing the threshold for ART initiation to a CD4 count ≤500 cells/uL. For certain patient groups, ART is recommended irrespective of CD4 count (PLHIV with active tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus infection, pregnant and breast feeding women, children aged under five years and those living in a sero-discordant relationship). In this operational research, we assess the effect of applying this recommendation on the number of PLHIV additionally eligible for ART."
8997,0.004,4.0,"Mutation rates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomes have been estimated using purified reverse transcriptase or single-round infection system. Since small sequences were used as templates, the overall mutation rates could only be extrapolated and the biological significance of mutations is unknown. For direct estimation of HIV-1 mutation rates and understanding of the potential biological influences of mutations, we obtained 19 complete or nearly full-length proviral genomes from single-round-infected adherent cells of lymphocytes by using a lambda phage library method and a long-range PCR technique. Analysis of 160,000 bp of sequences showed that the overall mutation rate of HIV-1 genomes was 5.4 x 10(-5) per base per replication cycle. On average, 1.1 mutations (range, 0 to 3) were generated in each viral genome during one infection cycle. Inspection of the mutations in the HIV-1 genome revealed that all site mutations within protein-coding regions were nonsynonymous mutations. Among all mutations, half were deleterious (premature stop codon and deletions) and would result in defective genomes. By applying the same system to an HIV-1 genome with a G262A mutation in the thumb region of the reverse transcriptase, a significant increase was observed in deletion and insertion mutation rates but no increase in the overall mutation rate in viral genomes was found."
8553,0.004,4.0,"Cohort studies of young (aged 18-30 years) injecting drug users recruited in 1997-1999 in the Harlem and Lower East Side areas of New York City, New York, were used to assess the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The authors found that HIV incidence was low at both sites: 0.8/100 person-years at the Harlem site and 0/100 person-years at the Lower East Side site. In contrast, HBV incidence was moderate (12.2/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (30.7/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Similarly, HCV incidence was moderate (9.3/100 person-years) at the Harlem site and high (34.0/100 person-years) at the Lower East Side site. Results show that high rates of HBV and HCV transmission do not imply high rates of HIV transmission, even within an area of high HIV seroprevalence."
1305,0.004,4.0,"To explore the biologic significance of the presence of a heterogeneous human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) population within infected individuals with regard to ultimate disease progression, the effect of coinfection of more than one variant of HIV on infectivity and cytopathogenicity in CD4-positive cells was examined. Using the lowest and highest infectious clones of HIV obtained by the plaque-cloning method, a clear consistent synergism of infectivity and cytopathic effects was detected when different cell lines were coinfected with a mixture of the two clones. These data suggest that the emergence of a highly infectious variant of HIV due to mutation may modify the infectivity of a minimally infectious latent variant with the final progression of HIV infection to overt AIDS."
9021,0.004,4.0,"The production of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has been reported as being significantly associated with the gene polymorphism in the leader sequence at positions +29. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations between the polymorphism and the clinical characteristics of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). A total of 422 (252 men; mean age: 49.7 +/- 11.2 years) Taiwanese CHC patients with liver biopsies were enrolled. The TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism at position +29 (T or C), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genotypes, and serum HCV RNA levels of these patients were determined. Of the 422 patients, the frequency of the T allele was 45.4%. Based on univariate analyses, a significantly lesser proportion of patients with allele T had high viral loads than those who were without allele T (P = 0.026). The lesser HCV RNA levels and HCV genotype 1b infection were significantly associated with the inheritance of the T allele in female patients based on univariate (P = 0.012 and 0.007, respectively) and multivariate regression (odds ratio/95% confidence interval: 0.434/0.219-0.859 and 0.468/0.237-0.927, respectively) analyses. In male patients with or without inheritance of the T allele, the clinical characteristics were similar. In conclusion, the association between TGF-beta1 polymorphism and virologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection implicated a significant role of host genetic factors on the clinical features of CHC. Female patients who carry T allele at position +29 were predisposed to be associated with HCV genotype non-1b infection and lesser HCV viral load, which revealed the gender effect."
8320,0.004,4.0,"This study shows first data on HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence among pregnant women in the non-endemic region of Argentina. In a retrospective study a representative sample (n = 3,143) of the pregnant women registered in the health public service in the province of Córdoba was evaluated. HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence was 0.191% +/- 0.0857 [IC 0.022-0.359]. This prevalence was 10 times higher in pregnant women than in blood donors [0.019 (4/21.183)]. The pregnant women would reflect the epidemiology of the general population more accurately since it constitutes a more heterogeneous group than that of blood donors. The prevalence of infection with HIV was 2.8 times higher than that of HTLV-1/2 (P < 0.05) and the presence of any of these two viruses was not a subrogating indicator of the presence of the other (Goodman and Kruskal's Tau coefficient = 0.0092). The prevalence of HBV was not significantly different from that of HTLV-1/2 (P > 0.05). We consider that it is necessary to carry out continuous studies in order to define the main risk factors for infection of these women. Thus, a decision could be made to apply the best policy in public health to prevent vertical transmission of the virus in Argentina."
3633,0.004,4.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C coinfections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected adults at an HIV center in Gaborone, Botswana. A retrospective review was performed of charts of currently active HIV-infected adult patients in the Family Model Clinic (FMC) of the Botswana-Baylor Children's Clinical Center of Excellence (BCOE) in Gaborone, Botswana, for the results of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antihepatitis C IgG tests performed between January 1, 2005 and December 15, 2009. Of 308 active FMC patients, 266 underwent HBsAg serology testing within the period of study. The HBsAg coinfection prevalence was 5.3% (14/266); 2 of 252 patients had at least one positive antihepatitis C IgG serology, a 0.8% prevalence. Hepatitis B coinfection is relatively common in HIV-infected adults at our center in Botswana, whereas hepatitis C coinfection is rare. In this setting, where the diagnosis of hepatitis B coinfection with HIV has implications for choice of first-line antiretroviral therapy and prevention of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, broader sampling to establish the true population prevalence of hepatitis B coinfection and the desirability of adding screening to HIV management should be considered. These findings provide little justification for adding hepatitis C coinfection screening to the management of HIV infection in Botswana."
1123,0.004,4.0,"In the last two decades, HIV-1, the retrovirus associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is globally one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, existing approaches for interventions are not able to suppress the progression of infection due to this virus. Of the many obstacles, viral entry into the mono-nuclear phagocyte system encompassing monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is a major concern. Viral infection is also responsible for the subsequent distribution of the virus into various tissues throughout the organism. Tremendous progress has been made during the past few years to diagnose and treat patients with HIV/AIDS infection, yet much remains to be done. Recommended treatment involves long-term and multiple drug therapy that causes severe side effects. With almost 12% of the world population suffering from HIV/AIDS, better management of this global threat is highly desired. Nanostructured delivery systems hold promise for improving the situation. Such systems can facilitate the uptake of antiretroviral drugs, causing a considerable improvement in HIV/AIDS therapy. Nanoscale systems have intriguing potential to drastically improve existing HIV/AIDS diagnosis and treatment platforms. Nanosystems constitute a wide range of systems varying from polymeric nanoparticles, to solid-lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, micro- and nanoemulsions, dendrimers, and self-nanoemulsifying systems. Improved bioavailability, solubility, stability, and biocompatibility make them an ideal choice for delivery of antiretroviral drugs. The present review initially describes an updated bird's-eye view account of the literature. Then, we provide a relatively sententious overview on updated patents of recent nanostructured delivery systems for antiretroviral drugs. Finally, we discuss low-cost therapy (such as antioxidants and immune modulators) for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. "
1140,0.004,4.0,"To better understand patient beliefs, which may influence adherence to HIV care and treatment, we examined three dimensions of beliefs among Ethiopian adults (n = 1177) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Beliefs about benefits of ART/HIV clinical care were largely accurate, but few patients believed in the ability of ART to prevent sexual transmission and many thought Holy Water could cure HIV. Factors associated with lower odds of accurate beliefs included advanced HIV, lack of formal education, and Muslim religion (benefits of ART/clinical care); secondary or university education and more clinic visits (ART to prevent sexual transmission); and pregnancy and Orthodox Christian religion (Holy Water). Assessment of patient beliefs may help providers identify areas needing reinforcement. In this setting, counselors also need to stress the benefits of ART as prevention and that Holy Water should not be used to the exclusion of HIV care and ART."

6867,0.003,3.0,"In this study, we aimed to explore whether interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene-promoter polymorphisms are associated with the outcome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In all, 204 chronically HBV-infected patients were recruited in this study. Of the 204 HBV-infected patients, 43 were considered to be inactive HBV carriers based on the sustained normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) together with seropositivity for the antibody to hepatitis B e-antigen (anti-HBe). A total of 161 patients were found to have chronic progressive liver disease, which included cirrhosis. In these HBV-infected patients, the frequencies of AA genotype of IL-18 gene-promoter polymorphisms at position -607 and C allele at position -137 were significantly higher in inactive HBV carriers compared with those in patients with chronic progressive liver disease. These polymorphisms of the IL-18 promoter regions (-607 and -137) could be associated with different outcomes of HBV infection."
5417,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Yupik Eskimos in southwestern Alaska, detected in early stages as a result of screening, appears to be more frequently associated with variants of chronic portal inflammation in the noninvolved liver than with fully developed cirrhosis, otherwise common in HBV-associated HCC from other geographic areas. Of 38 patients diagnosed with HCC since 1969, adequate tissue was available from both the tumor and nontumorous liver in 17. Of the 17 specimens, 14 had chronic portal inflammation and three had advanced cirrhosis; 12 of the 14 were from hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. These 12 cases were studied in detail to examine the features accompanying the development of HCC unobscured by cirrhotic transformation. In the noninvolved parenchyma they included hepatocytic nodules as apparent precursors to HCC and, as markers of phenotypic alterations, dysplastic hepatocytes and hepatitis B surface antigen-laden ground-glass hepatocytes. The latter were observed in eight instances and often accumulated in nodules. Parenchyma within 1 mm of the HCC exhibited increased confluent hyperplasia and frequently conspicuous necroinflammation associated with pericellular and periductular fibrosis, which contributed, in addition to fibrous connections between displaced and heavily inflamed portal tracts, to the capsule that was forming in all cases to varying degrees in the pericarcinomatous region. The HCC was uniformly trabecular and in a few specimens, a continuous transition from hyperplasia and dysplasia near the periphery of the tumor to increasing anaplasia in the center could be made out in addition to pressure effects of the HCC. The pericarcinomatous changes, including hyperplasia progressing to neoplasia and necroinflammation, are also observed in experimental models, particularly the woodchuck HCC induced by a hepadna virus related to HBV. Coordinated morphologic and molecular biologic studies on such animal models and on human HCC detected by screening, as for instance in Eskimos, neither complicated by cirrhosis, should elucidate the direction of the evolution of the HCC and the postulated promoting role of the inflammation."

Information is lacking regarding the prevalence of cigarette smoking among people living with HIV or about their intentions to quit smoking. A survey was conducted with a sample of patients attending an HIV outpatient clinic at San Francisco General Hospital to assess the prevalence of cigarette smoking and the level of interest in quitting. In total, 228 assessments were completed. Study results revealed a high percentage of smokers among our sample of individuals living with HIV compared to the percentage of smokers found in the general adult population. A total of 123 individuals (54%) reported that they smoked cigarettes. Men were more than twice as likely to have made previous attempts at smoking cessation than were woman. The majority of cigarette smokers (63%) reported that they were currently thinking about quitting. Respondents' preferences for types of smoking cessation methods are discussed, and recommendations are proposed for identifying and treating tobacco dependence in this population."
1286,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) introduced in association with the luciferase reporter gene into Jurkat T cells was strongly activated by a combination of human neutrophils and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Activation was not observed when normal neutrophils were replaced by neutrophils which lack a respiratory burst, ie, from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), was strongly inhibited by catalase, was potentiated by vanadate, was stimulated by relatively low concentrations of azide, and was inhibited by selective inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC). The PMA affected activation in three ways: (1) by directly activating the LTR in Jurkat LTRluc; (2) by inducing a respiratory burst in neutrophils with the formation of H2O2; and (3) by increasing the sensitivity of Jurkat LTRluc to the activating effect of H2O2. When PMA was replaced by opsonized zymosan as the neutrophil stimulus, activation of the LTR was low unless azide was added. Activation in the presence of azide was not seen when CGD neutrophils were used or when catalase was added, suggesting that azide acts by inhibiting the degradation of H2O2. These findings indicate that activation of the HIV-1 LTR in Jurkat T cells can be induced by H2O2 released by neutrophils, particularly when PKC is concomitantly activated."
8726,0.003,3.0,"We report the first study on prevalence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations in Venezuela. Protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) coding regions were analyzed in DNA samples obtained from 100 HIV-1-infected individuals. Primary resistance mutations to RT inhibitors were identified in 26% of patients treated with these drugs. Transmission of HIV-1-resistant strains was detected in a drug-naive patient (3%). Primary resistance mutations to protease inhibitors (PIs) were present in 9% of the 44 PI-treated patients and in 1 PI-naive individual. Phylogenetic analysis of these samples has resulted in the most extensive survey, to date, of HIV-1 genetic forms circulating in Venezuela. Ninety-nine samples clustered with subtype B, and 1 individual harbored the first B/F recombinant virus reported in Venezuela, with protease clustering with subtype F and RT with subtype B.

2792,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence and the clinical course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were studied in 23 HIV-1-infected children, who were born to 22 mothers with HIV-1/HCV coinfection. During the follow-up only two children (8.7%) showed persistent anti-HCV antibodies and circulating HCV RNA. Both children, who were aged 10 and 10.6 years respectively at the end of follow-up, had chronically-evolving liver disease and autoimmune thrombocytopenia but no signs of progressive HIV disease. Based on our experience, vertically-acquired HIV-1/HCV coinfection is less frequent than is generally reported and may be associated with the development of chronic thrombocytopenia in addition to liver disease. Moreover, perinatal HIV-1/HCV coinfection appears to be associated with a slow progression of HIV disease."
8834,0.003,3.0,"Our aim was to study the characteristics of hepatitis G virus (HGV) infection in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We evaluated 108 patients from two different units (A: 67 patients; B: 41 patients). HGV RNA and HCV RNA were detected by PCR. Nineteen patients (17.6%) were HGV RNA positive (20.9% in unit A and 12.2% in unit B (NS)). HCV RNA was positive in 19 patients (17.6%) (28.4% in unit A and 0 in unit B (p < 0.01)). Eight patients were HGV RNA and HCV RNA positive (group I), 11 HGV RNA positive (group II), 11 HCV RNA positive (group III), and 78 negative for both viruses (group IV). Time on HD was 51.3 +/- 37.0 months for group I, 36.0 +/- 27.9 months for group II, 63.5 +/- 40.2 months for group III, and 26.4 +/- 27.1 months for group IV (p < 0.01 for I and III). Seven patients (87.5%) from group I, 9 (81.8%) from group II, 10 (90.9%) from group III, and 44 (56.4%) from group IV had a history of transfusion (p < 0.03 for I, II and III). Two patients (25%) from group I, none from group II, 5 (45.4%) from group III, and 6 (7.7%) from group IV had chronic ALAT elevation (p < 0.01 for I and III). We conclude that HGV infection was frequent in our HD patients, related to transfusions and independent of HCV prevalence, and that HGV infection itself was not a cause of ALAT elevation suggesting chronic hepatitis."
2568,0.003,3.0,"Background Portugal has the highest prevalence rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. Objective A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. Methods Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV-1/HIV-2 or HIV p24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. Results During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from <1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI ( p < 0.01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients ( p < 0.05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80% of patients are currently retained in care. Conclusion This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. As in the past, the importance of Dermato-Venereology for HIV infection diagnosis remains present in daily clinical practice."
9176,0.003,3.0,"The authors aimed to describe cell phone and Internet use and assess the correlation of Internet use for health care engagement purposes and HIV clinical outcomes among HIV-positive individuals. The authors conducted a national survey using online social media to examine cell phone and Internet use, self-reported HIV viral load (detectable vs. undetectable), and antiretroviral adherence rating (excellent vs. less than excellent). Participants (N = 1,494) were asked about their Internet use for health care engagement purposes (including e-mailing health care providers, refilling medications online, and making medical appointments online). Approximately 95% of participants accessed the Internet nearly daily or daily in the past month (mean hours on Internet use per day = 5.2) and 55.5% used the Internet for health care engagement purposes. Those who used the Internet for any health care engagement purposes had a 1.52-fold odds of reporting an undetectable viral load (p = .009) and a 1.49-fold odds of reporting excellent adherence (p = .001). Although Internet access and use were similar across racial/ethnic, educational, and socioeconomic groups, disparities existed with the use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes among racial/ethnic minorities, those with low to moderate financial stability, lower education, and history of incarceration. The authors' data reveal that among HIV-positive users of online social media, use of the Internet for health care engagement purposes is associated with better self-reported virologic and adherence outcomes."

The anti-HCV was performed by third generation immunoenzymatic technique, and the HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C virus was 16% (CI: 12.4 - 19.6). Multivariate analysis showed association between virus C infection and age, with significant risk in the group about fifty years old or more (OR=9.75), blood transfusion (OR=4.74) and use of injecting drugs (OR=149.28). The hepatitis C virus infection was detected in 83.7% of intravenous drug users and 22.1% of transfused patients.

Cell culture for CMV detected 9.3% of the PCR-positive samples, whilst histology identified CMV inclusions in 15.9% of samples, all of which were CMV PCR-positive. CMV was most frequently detected in adrenal and lung tissues by histology. These results show that co-infection with CMV and HIV is a common occurrence in organs from AIDS patients and provide further evidence for a role of cytomegalovirus in the pathogenesis of AIDS."
3774,0.003,3.0,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals do not have any obvious risk factors and one of the putative sources of infection may be inadvertent exposure to infected blood or body fluids in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to assess the role of medical procedures in transmission of hepatitis C in north-eastern Poland. In total, 194 patients with chronic hepatitis C were eligible for the study. The control group consisted of 275 age- and sex-matched individuals. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use were excluded. On multivariate analysis, transfusions [odds ratio (OR) = 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-6.3], minor surgery (OR = 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.7) and dental care (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4-4.0) were independently associated with HCV infection. We conclude that apart from transfusion, minor medical procedures and dental care may carry a significant risk of hepatitis C infection. Improvements in basic hygiene routines and strict adherence to universal precautions may be essential to prevent iatrogenic transmission of the infection."

5501,0.003,3.0,"Thirty-four patients from the Philadelphia area with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were matched with colon cancer patients, lung cancer patients and blood donors according to age and sex. Sera from the four groups were tested to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Five of the HCC patients (14.7%) and none of the controls were positive for HBsAg. At least one of the three serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was found in 51.5% of the HCC patients, 5.3% of the colon cancer patients, 11.1% of the lung cancer patients, and 10.7% of the blood donors. Twelve of the seventeen seropositive HCC patients (70.6%) were positive for anti-HBc alone, while all of the seropositive lung cancer patients and donors were positive for anti-HBs alone. Sera positive for any HBV marker were also tested for e antigen (HBeAg) and its antibody (anti-HBe). Four of the HCC patients (23.5% of the seropositives) had anti-HBe, while none of the sera tested had HBeAg. A history of alcoholism did not appear to influence HBV seropositivity in the HCC patients. This study supports the hypothesis that HBV infection is closely associated with HCC even in areas where both conditions are uncommon. The wide disparity between seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HBc in the HCC patients is an unusual feature, for which an age effect may be the best explanation."
7585,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was determined in the relatives, friends, and sex partners of AIDS patients in Haiti and in other unrelated Haitian population groups. Among contacts of AIDS patients, HIV seroprevalence was highest among sex partners of the opposite sex (55%) and lowest among female relatives and friends (9%) of female AIDS patients. Male relatives and friends of male AIDS patients had a seroprevalence rate of 19% and also had a history of multiple heterosexual partners and frequent contact with prostitutes. The HIV seroprevalence rate among unrelated groups of Haitian adults ranged from 2% in rural healthy adults to 22% among tuberculosis patients to a high of 49% among Haitian prostitutes. This seroprevalence pattern suggests that HIV infection is widespread in Haiti and that heterosexual activity plays a major role in transmission."
5986,0.003,3.0,"To address the unique manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among adolescents aged 13 through 21 years, a comprehensive evaluation and treatment program for high-risk and HIV-positive adolescents was developed in New York City in 1987. Among HIV-infected youth, mean age of testing was 18.2 years. One third of the HIV-positive patients were female and four fifths were African-American or Hispanic. No significant differences were found between HIV-positive (n = 50) and HIV-negative (n = 43) patients for age at first intercourse, injecting or other illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted diseases, or survival sex (exchange of sex for money or drugs). HIV-positive males were more likely than HIV-negative males to have engaged in anal intercourse and to report a history of sexual abuse. Among infected females, 82% acquired HIV through heterosexual intercourse. Almost half (48%) of HIV-positive adolescents had significant immune dysfunction at the time of their initial visit (CD4 < 500/mm3) and were eligible for zidovudine. Many HIV-positive adolescents continued high-risk behaviors such as intercourse without condoms, particularly those with ongoing dependence on drugs or alcohol. With the epidemic of HIV infection increasing nationwide among adolescents, specialized, comprehensive programs are needed to counsel and treat HIV-infected adolescents and youth in high-risk situations."
10004,0.003,3.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has become the gold standard treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. NRTI-related mitochondrial toxicity has been recognized as a serious adverse effect of HAART. The mechanisms underlying NRTI-induced mitochondriopathy involve the inhibition of the human DNA polymerase gamma mtDNA mutations and oxidative stress. The clinical spectrum of NRTI-related toxicity ranges from a subclinical disease e.g. mild hepatic abnormalities, to a rare life-threatening condition with lactic acidosis and hepatic insufficiency. In the latter, liver histology shows massive steatosis. Ultrastructural assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities may be of help to address the NRTI toxicity in poorly symptomatic patients. Efforts have been recently made to assess the clinical relevance of non-invasive tests including the evaluation of mtDNA or mitochondrial functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for the diagnosis of NRTI-associated toxicity."
6231,0.003,3.0,An increase of the mean corpuscular volume of the red blood cells has been repeatedly described in antiretroviral treated patients. Most commonly macrocytosis was associated with the use of certain nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to analyse if macrocytosis might be a marker of mitochondrial toxicity in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients. Using the (13)C-methionine breath test we analysed the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo in antiretrovirally treated HIV-infected patients with macrocytosis. MCV was significantly negatively correlated to the breath test results. For the first time we could show a significant association between an increase of the mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume by treatment with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and the hepatic mitochondrial function in vivo.
5112,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly endemic in the Solomon Islands. However, little is known about the status of occult HBV infection in the Solomon Islands. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV infection and its clinical and virological features in the community of Solomon Islands. Blood samples were collected from a total of 564 asymptomatic individuals aged over 18 years in the Western province. The samples used in the present study consisted of 200 samples from 108 males and 92 females (mean age, 37.4 years; range, 18-71 years) that were randomly selected among the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative samples from all the participants enrolled in this study. HBV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR in 25 (12.5%) of the 200 HBsAg-negative samples. Most of the HBV-DNA-positive individuals were infected with wild-type HBV, and only 3 strains demonstrated specific amino acid substitutions (P121X, T123N, C138S, P142S and D144E) in the α determinant region. In conclusion, occult HBV infection was documented in 12.5% of individuals that demonstrated serologic evidence of resolved HBV infection in this study. The prevalence of occult infection was also influenced by ethnicity; it was more prevalent in Melanesians than Micronesians. In addition, occult HBV infection demonstrated a weak association with the S-variants."
7127,0.003,3.0,The advent of new chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapies requires characterization of patients in order to predict adequate treatment. A good candidate marker is Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) which is involved in progression of HCV infection.

4403,0.003,3.0,"The successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), a combination of potent antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, has impacted positively on morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. Over time, HAART has been associated with a number of metabolic and anthropometric abnormalities, including dyslipidemia and insulin resistance as well as subcutaneous fat loss and abdominal obesity, potentially contributing to cardiovascular risk. Recent studies have more firmly established that both HIV infection and HAART might increase the risk of clinical cardiovascular events. Furthermore, whereas HIV/HAART is associated with multiple aspects of endocrine dysfunction, there has been less focus on bone disease, although some studies indicate a higher prevalence of osteoporosis among HIV-positive subjects compared to HIV-negative controls. The relationship between bone and fat metabolism under HIV-positive conditions deserves further attention, and available data suggest the possibility of an intriguing connection. In the future, an increasing population of aging HIV-positive patients with a spectrum of antiretroviral therapies and accumulation of endocrine abnormalities and conventional cardiovascular risk factors will present preventive and therapeutic challenges to our health-care system."
2402,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progressively depletes GSH content in humans. Although the accumulated evidence suggests a role of decreased GSH in the pathogenesis of HIV, significant controversy remains concerning the mechanism of GSH depletion, especially in regard to envisioning appropriate therapeutic strategies to help compensate for such decreased antioxidant capacity. Tat, a transactivator encoded by HIV, is sufficient to cause GSH depletion in vitro and is implicated in AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphoma. In this study, we report a decrease in GSH biosynthesis with Tat, using HIV-1 Tat transgenic (Tat+) mice. A significant decline in the total intracellular GSH content in liver and erythrocytes of Tat+ mice was accompanied by decreased gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulatory subunit mRNA and protein content, which resulted in an increased sensitivity of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase to feedback inhibition by GSH. Further study revealed a significant reduction in the activity of GSH synthetase in liver of Tat+ mice, which was linearly associated with their GSH content. Therefore, Tat appears to decrease GSH in vivo, at least partially, through modulation of GSH biosynthetic enzymes."
3710,0.003,3.0,"In order to evaluate the interference of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in hepatitis B viral particle (HBsAg, HBcAg) expression in the liver of chronic HDV patients, 39 and 81 liver biopsies of HBsAg carriers seropositive for anti-HDV and anti-HDV negative controls, respectively, were studied. HBcAg was positive in 16.7% of the HBeAg-positive patients with HDAg in the liver and in 91,4% of controls. In contrast, in HBeAg- and anti-HDV negative patients the intrahepatic expression of HBcAg was detected in 32.6%. In anti-HDV negative patients the HBcAg liver expression correlated significantly with the HBeAg in serum (p < 0.00001). The distribution of HBcAg was exclusively cytoplasmatic in 30% of HDV-infected patients but mixed nuclear and cytoplasmic in 38.3% of the controls. The nuclear expression of HBcAg was decreased in chronic HDV infection. HBsAg was positive in 70.3% of patients who were anti-HDV positive and in 82.3% of controls. The membranous expression of HBsAg was detected less frequently in HDV-infected patients (p < 0.05) than in controls, while associated with HBeAg in serum of HBV carriers without HDV superinfection (p < 0.00001). The prevalence and the HBsAg cytoplasmic expression was not different for the chronic HDV infection or controls. Our results show: 1) decreased intrahepatic expression of HBcAg and membranous HBsAg in HBV carriers superinfected with HDV, suggesting decreased HBV replication in the liver of these patients. 2) the changing of HBcAg and HBsAg expression in the liver of HDV-infected patients, suggest not so much a decrease but rather a modulation in HBV replication."
303,0.003,3.0,"Subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk for atherosclerosis. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) assessed using ultrasound and coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected using computed tomography predict cardiovascular risk in the general population; however, their usefulness and comparability in patients with HIV are less well defined. The purpose of this study was to compare IMT and CAC in the detection of atherosclerosis in subjects with HIV. CAC and IMT were measured in 253 HIV-infected and 58 uninfected adults. Associations among HIV-related factors, traditional risk factors, and CAC and IMT were evaluated. The distribution of IMT among subjects with and without CAC was compared. Among the patients with HIV, 37% had detectable CAC compared to 28% of controls (p = 0.19); 16% of the patients with HIV had CAC >100 compared to 5% of controls (p = 0.03). With either detectable or undetectable CAC, HIV-infected subjects had higher IMT compared to controls (1.02 ± 0.34 vs 0.78 ± 0.12 mm, p <0.0001), even after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Among those with undetectable CAC, 34% of patients with HIV had markedly increased IMT (≥1 mm) compared to no controls (p <0.0001). HIV-related factors were associated with IMT but not with CAC. In conclusion, patients with HIV and controls had similar rates of detectable CAC, while absolute CAC scores were modestly higher in the HIV group. Conversely, carotid IMT detected advanced subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with HIV even in the absence of CAC. Thus, with HIV, IMT is associated with disease-related factors and may be a more sensitive indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis than CAC."

5527,0.003,3.0,"To explore the relationship between absolute dendritic cell (DC) counts at the early stage of primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection (PHI) and subsequent disease progression, we performed a prospective study of 16 rapid progressors (RPs) and 12 typical progressors (TPs) from a PHI cohort of men who have sex with men. Significantly decreased plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and myeloid DC (mDC) counts in the blood of RPs were observed at study entry as compared with TPs and healthy HIV-1-negative subjects. Low baseline pDC counts were significantly associated with rapid disease progression after adjustment for baseline CD4(+) T cell counts, mDC counts, and HIV-1 load. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that low pDC counts were strongly associated with rapid disease progression. Our findings demonstrated the predictive value of blood absolute pDC counts at baseline in PHI for HIV-1 disease progression. Further studies are required to confirm this notion."

The incidence rate in China is escalating obviously. Currently there is lack of large samples and long-term systematic observations of ocular pathological changes in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected and AIDS patients. Diagnostic errors and missed diagnosis still exist in hospitals, even in some advanced hospitals. They delay the therapy of patients, also easily result in hospital acquired infections. It is notable that there is insufficient attention to preoperative test of anti-HIV in some hospitals, especially in outpatient surgeries. Therefore potential iatrogenic infection risks are hidden. Some clinical doctors are afraid of AIDS patients, therefore they are lack of subjective initiative to comprehensively examination and treatment the patients. For the past few years, highly active antiretroviral therapy is widely used, AIDS related morbidity and mortality is significantly reduced, and the prevalence rate of ocular complications decreased from 55% to 95%. But due to the HIV/AIDS patient volume increased year by year, and the survival rate raised, prolonged survival, results in the increase of the absolute number of patients with ocular complications. Therefore it is critical to pay attention to the HIV/AIDS ocular lesions in the diagnosis and treatment of iatrogenic infection. "

2019,0.003,3.0,"The main goal of the present paper was to analyze the molecular diversity of the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) of the HIV 1 gp120 in samples from patients of Argentina. The study was carried out on a total of 30 HIV 1 positive blood samples, obtained during 1991-1992, belonging to 15 intravenous drug users (group A), 5 homosexual men (group B), 8 children born to HIV 1 positive mothers (group C) and 2 AIDS patients (group D). By using extracted DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from infected cells of the viral isolates in the case of the 2 AIDS patients, the V3 loop region was amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequencing by Sanger methodology was then performed on DNA fragments and nucleotide sequences obtained were translated into the correspondent amino acids. Consensus sequences for each group and a general consensus sequence were established (Table 1). Its alignment with V3 loop amino acid sequences of the major HIV 1 strains isolated worldwide is showed in table 2. Homology analysis between each sequence of the study population and sequence of different HIV 1 isolates showed that most of these samples share high homology with SF2 and BH10 strains. In contrast a low homology was found with JH3 and MN isolated (table 3). The presence of highly conserved amino acid residues as substitutions and insertions was determined in the Argentinian V3 loop sequences giving them a local pattern. The present paper is of great importance for our country, considering that the V3 loop is the main neutralizing domain becoming a major target in the development of HIV 1 vaccine. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the sequencing of the principal neutralizing domain of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 in Latin America."
5875,0.003,3.0,"The knowledge of being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) brings about psychological distress and social problems including anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Participating in psychosocial intervention programs can help to reduce these problems. To date, however, very little is known about the efficacy of different intervention strategies. We implemented a study with a randomized experimental design to investigate the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral group psychotherapy (CBT) and an experiential group psychotherapy (ET) program for 39 asymptomatic HIV-infected homosexual men. Both therapies consisted of 17 sessions over a 15-week period. The major finding of this study was that psychosocial intervention, independent of the therapeutic orientation, decreased distress significantly, as compared with a waiting-list control group (WCG). There were no significant changes in the intervention groups as compared with the WCG in coping styles, social support, and emotional expression. Finally, CBT and ET did not differ in their effects on psychological distress or on the other psychosocial variables measured in this study."
8468,0.003,3.0,"Recently, a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutant with HBe antigen-negative phenotype has been characterized, in which one TATA box-like motif of the precore/core promoter had degenerated: most frequently by both A-->T and G-->A mutations at positions 1762 and 1764, respectively. The clinical significance of this mutant is as yet unknown. In our present study, the T1762 A1764 mutant was sought in sera from HBV-infected blood donors and chronic liver disease patients by directly sequencing a PCR-amplified region of HBVDNA. Also, because the A1764 mutation generates a Sau3AI cleavage site (GGTC-->GATC), we digested the PCR products with Sau3AI to see if cleavage would occur at this specific site. Our results mostly corroborated the earlier report but we found a higher-than-predicted frequency of HBe antigen-positive blood donors positive for the mutant (22%). The titres of HBe antigen in these mutant-positive sera were slightly decreased compared to the titres in wild-type HBV infection. In addition, these blood donors had relatively high (though within the normal range) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, suggesting that the T1762 A1764 mutation could be used as a sensitive laboratory marker for insidious hepatitis in these otherwise 'asymptomatic' carriers. The Sau3AI assay, which is much more convenient than sequencing, was shown to be useful for the detection of the T1762 A1764 mutant in an extensive number of clinical samples."

2626,0.003,3.0,"We have studied the roles of immunoprophylaxis, patient selection policy and coexistent hepatitis D virus infection in the outcome of 56 HBsAg-positive elective liver transplant recipients. Twenty-nine unselected patients not treated with immunoprophylaxis formed group 1 and were compared to a recent consecutive series of 27 patients (group 2) in whom pre-transplant serological status was determined and who received immunoprophylaxis. One-year actuarial HBsAg serological recurrence rates were 48% in group 2 and 90% in group 1 with particular improvement in recipients who were either HBV DNA-negative or who had co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection. One-year patient survival has improved from 62% in group 1 to 86% in group 2 with improvements in hepatitis delta virus-negative and replicating recipients. Patients who have either co-existent hepatitis delta virus infection or are in group 2 have 1-year survival rates comparable to elective HBsAg-negative recipients (19/21 (90%), 22/27 (86%) vs 87%, respectively). In the event of recurrence, severe graft injury is diminished in recent patients and in those with coexistent delta infection who also have lower levels of circulating HBV DNA. Retransplantation for associated graft injury has a poor prognosis irrespective of administration of immunoprophylaxis. In elective liver recipients, immunoprophylaxis and/or hepatitis delta virus infection modulate hepatitis B virus recurrence and associated graft injury with consequent improvement in patient survival."
6774,0.003,3.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (OBI) is highly prevalent worldwide. In some cases, it is a consequence of infection with variant viruses mutated in the S gene and producing a surface antigen not recognized by diagnostic kits. In most cases, OBI is due to a strong inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV) activities exerted by host defense mechanisms. OBI may reactivate in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy and/or chemotherapy with the possibility of a consequent development of acute hepatitis that may lead to hepatic failure. Hematological malignancies and therapeutic schedules including rituximab are the conditions most frequently associated with OBI reactivation. However, this event may occur in a large number of additional clinical and therapeutic settings. Identification of patients prone to undergo reactivation is of great importance for promptly starting a proper antiviral therapy that may stop the HBV reactivation and prevent its clinical sequelae."
8806,0.003,3.0,"This study focused on dietary glycemic index because insulin resistance can be important in the pathogenesis of fat deposition in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated differences in past dietary glycemic intake between men with HIV who developed fat deposition and those who did not. This was a nested case-control study consisting of 37 cases and 37 controls from the Nutrition for Healthy Living cohort. Food records from 6 to 24 months prior to development of fat deposition in cases were analyzed and compared with controls. Cases were defined as men with a waist-to-hip ratio >0.95 and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) between 23 and 26. Controls were matched by age, race, body mass index, highly active antiretroviral therapy use, and CD4 count. Food records were analyzed using t tests for normally distributed nutrients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for nutrients with skewed distributions. Glycemic index was calculated for each meal and day. There was no significant difference in glycemic index for meals and day between participants with or without fat deposition. Both groups had a moderate dietary glycemic index intake. This study showed no association between dietary glycemic index and development of fat deposition in HIV. Instead, results of this study depict the potential benefits associated with eating high-quality diets, primarily adequate fiber and protein intake. Diet can be important in preventing development of fat deposition in patients with HIV."

This study aimed to describe the frequency of primary mutations associated with HIV-1 drug resistance and the prevalence of genetic HIV subtypes in a population of vertically infected children before the initiation of HAART. At the time of genotypic testing, the median age was 6.0 years (IQR 25-75%: 3.8-9.2) and the median age at admission was 3.84 years (IQR 25-75%: 1.23-6.11). Antepartum maternal ARV exposure for PMTCT occurred for three (7.3%) mothers. According to the WHO criteria, primary ARV resistance mutations were detected in four out of 41 (9.8%) children. Subtype B was the most prevalent (63.4%). The relatively high prevalence of primary HIV-1 DRMs in this cohort of perinatally infected children in Brazil supports the local recommendation to perform resistance testing in all newly diagnosed children, regardless of age at diagnosis and antenatal ARV exposure."
4703,0.003,3.0,"Injection drug use is a common route of infection for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the UK. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence and force of infection for HBV among injecting drug users (IDUs) recruited from multiple community and drug agency settings in England and Wales between 1990 and 2004. Cross-sectional studies of IDUs in and out of contact with drug agencies were conducted throughout the 15-year period. Oral fluid samples were tested for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between risk factors and anti-HBc positivity and force of infection models were explored. In total, 2527 injectors were recruited from community settings, and 29 386 from drug agencies. Anti-HBc prevalence was 31% (95% CI 30.7-31.8%). It declined in the early 1990s from around 50% in 1992 to 25% in 1999, after which it increased slightly. It was also higher in those who had injected for longer, older IDUs, those recruited in London and North West England, and those reporting having a previous voluntary confidential HIV test. The force of infection models suggested that the incidence of infection increased in 1999-2004 compared with 1993-1998, and was higher in new injectors compared with those injecting for > or =1 year. In conclusion, findings suggest ongoing HBV transmission in recent years despite an overall decline in prevalence in the early and mid-1990s, and highlight the importance of targeting vaccination programmes at new IDUs who have high incidence rates of infection."

Using qualitative data, this paper identifies potential lay social resources for support of PrEP adherence by HIV serodiscordant couples in Uganda, laying the groundwork for incorporation of these resources into adherence support initiatives as part of implementation. The qualitative analysis characterizes support for PrEP adherence provided by HIV-infected spouses, children, extended family members, and the larger community. Results suggest social resources for support of PrEP adherence in Africa are plentiful outside formal health care settings and health systems and that couples will readily use them. The same shortage of health professionals that impeded scale-up of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS in Africa promises to challenge delivery of PrEP. Building on the treatment scale-up experience, implementers can address this challenge by examining the value of lay social resources for adherence support in developing strategies for delivery of PrEP."

Data analysis showed reflections that evidence the paradox in the AIDS epidemic: knowledge does not change behavior; gender relations; fear of death; fear of stigma; financial problems; disbelief in the virus' existence. Identifying beliefs and understanding how to influence the conduction of the health problem can help services to promote patients' adherence."
9328,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) causes liver fibrosis, which is accelerated by unknown mechanisms in patients with HIV-1 coinfection. The evolution of HCV quasispecies in this setting of coinfection is not fully understood. To compare HCV quasispecies between HIV-HCV coinfection and HCV monoinfection, we sequenced 340 HCV clones from the HVR-1 and NS3 regions at two different time points in two groups of treatment-naïve patients with HCV-1a infection: (1) HIV-HCV positive (n=6); and (2) HIV negative-HCV positive (n=3). In HCV/HIV coinfection, we found a trend for reduced HCV genetic complexity and diversity, and a trend towards reduced dN/dS ratios in the HVR-1 region, especially in those patients with CD4<200cells/mm(3), who lost positive selective immune pressure in the HVR-1 region. Differences in immune regulation of HCV quasispecies in HIV coinfected individuals deserve further exploration to clarify the different outcomes of chronic hepatitis C noted between the immunocompromised and the immunocompetent host."
4327,0.003,3.0,"The rate of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or 2 and human lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I or II was determined in Nigeria using 4153 human sera collected from different categories of people in 21 locations in the country. Eight (0.2%) of samples showed evidence of mixed infection with different combinations of HIV-1 or 2 and HTLV-I or II. One of the eight samples was positive for the four human retroviruses. Patients with other sexually transmitted diseases and those of sexually active age groups are more likely to be infected with multiple human retroviruses than other categories of people whose sera were tested. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between genders. The clinical and virological implications of this finding are discussed."
4738,0.003,3.0,"Opportunistic infections such as cryptosporidiosis and cyclosporiasis are commonly encountered in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We investigated the existence of opportunistic protozoans that significantly affect the quality of life in HIV-1 infected patients using conventional and molecular methods. The study group comprised 115 HIV-1 positive patients. In the identification of Cyclospora cayetanensis and Cryptosporidium, the formol-ether precipitation method was used and smears were evaluated in optical microscope by staining modified Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN). The primers and probes used for PCR were Heat shock protein 70 for C. cayetanensis and the oocysts wall protein for Cryptosporidium spp.. Cyclospora and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in one and two patients, respectively, by staining, whereas we detected C. cayetanensis in three patients out of 115 (2.6%) by PCR, and Cryptosporidium spp. in a further three patients (2.6%). C. cayetensis was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 64 cells/μm, 182 cells/μm and 287 cells/μm, respectively. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in patients with CD4 counts of 176 cells/μm, 241 cells/μm and 669 cells/μm. As conclusion, PCR method is faster and more sensitive than microscopic methods and to screen intestinal pathogens routinely in patients infected with HIV should not be neglected in developing countries like Turkey."
430,0.003,3.0,"Because of the advent of highly effective treatments, routine screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been recommended for many Americans. This study explored the perceived barriers surrounding routine HIV and HCV screening in a diverse sample of community health centers (CHCs). The Community Health Applied Research Network (CHARN) is a collaboration of CHCs, with a shared clinical database. In July, 2013, 195 CHARN providers working in 12 CHCs completed a survey of their attitudes and beliefs about HIV and HCV testing. Summary statistics were generated to describe the prevalence of HIV and HCV and associated demographics by CHCs. HIV and HCV prevalence ranged from 0.1% to 5.7% for HIV and from 0.1% to 3.7% for HCV in the different CHCs. About 15% of the providers cared for at least 50 individuals with HIV and the same was true for HCV. Two-thirds saw less than 10 patients with HIV and less than half saw less than 10 patients with HCV. Less than two-thirds followed USPHS guidelines to screen all patients for HIV between the ages of 13 and 64, and only 44.4% followed the guidance to screen all baby boomers for HCV. Providers with less HIV experience tended to be more concerned about routine screening practices. More experienced providers were more likely to perceive lack of time being an impediment to routine screening. Many US CHC providers do not routinely screen their patients for HIV and HCV. Although additional education about the rationale for routine screening may be indicated, incentives to compensate providers for the additional time they anticipate spending in counseling may also facilitate increased screening rates."

The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of previous or occult HBV infection in a cohort of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with histologically advanced chronic hepatitis C in the United States who did or did not develop HCC. Stored sera from 91 patients with HCC and 182 matched controls who participated in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial were tested for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody, and HBV DNA. Frozen liver samples from 28 HCC cases and 55 controls were tested for HBV DNA by way of real-time polymerase chain reaction. Anti-HBc (as a marker of previous HBV infection) was present in the serum of 41.8% HCC cases and 45.6% controls (P=0.54); anti-HBc alone was present in 16.5% of HCC cases and 24.7% of controls. HBV DNA was detected in the serum of only one control subject and no patients with HCC. HBV DNA (as a marker of occult HBV infection) was detected in the livers of 10.7% of HCC cases and 23.6% of controls (P=0.18)."
7202,0.003,3.0,"Directly addressing HIV medication adherence and substance use together is ideal in light of the research on the complex connections between these two behaviors. This paper describes the development of a pilot program in which a combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention was used to increase adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and reduce substance use in HIV-infected adults. The main goals of the pilot study were (1) to confirm the ability to recruit HIV-positive substance users taking HAART; (2) to demonstrate the ability to retain participants over the course of an eight-session intervention; and (3) to examine changes in substance use and HAART adherence from pretreatment to posttreatment. Twelve HIV-positive adults with a substance use disorder participated in an 8-week intervention, which consisted of weekly individual sessions with a trained therapist. Results showed that despite the small sample size, there was a significant reduction in substance use from pretreatment to posttreatment. No statistically significant differences were found for changes in HIV medication adherence, but the trends suggest the potential for positive results with a larger sample. Retention for all eight sessions of the treatment was 73.3%. Eighty percent completed the 3-month follow-up assessment. Participants reported high therapeutic alliance reflecting comfort with their therapists and in the treatment. Overall, the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the treatment. Furthermore, results suggest that this may, in fact, be an effective intervention to reduce substance use and improve HIV medication adherence."
6760,0.003,3.0,"The objective was to determine whether there is an association between carriage of oral yeasts, malnutrition and HIV-1 infection among Tanzanian children. A case-control study design within a cross-sectional study was used, and the outcome was carriage of oral yeasts. The exposure variables were malnutrition and HIV-1 antibody, and confounders to be adjusted for were age, sex, and breastfeeding. The study was carried out in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, in two maternal and child health (MCH) clinics that offer routine medical checkups to all expectant mothers and children aged between 0 and 5 years in the catchment area. A total of 882 children aged between 18 months and 5 years participated. Smears from the tongue and buccal mucosa were examined for oral yeasts. Malnutrition was categorized according to standards on the MCH chart and World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control (WHO/CDC) standards as weight-for-height (wasted), weight-for-age (underweight), and height-for-age (stunted). HIV-1 infection was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive sera were confirmed by Western Blot. About 27% of the children were slightly or severely malnourished according to standards on the MCH chart. According to WHO/CDC standards, 2.6% were wasted, 16.3% were underweight, and 29.6% were stunted. Fourteen (1.6%) were seropositive for HIV-1 antibody. Hyphal forms and blastospores were much more frequent among children infected with HIV-1 with odds ratios ranging from 3.8 (95% CI: 1.3;11.2) to 6.2 (95% CI: 2.1;18.4) depending on categorization of malnutrition. Malnutrition was a risk factor, too, albeit to a much lesser and insignificant degree. The study supports our previous findings that malnutrition may predispose to carriage of oral yeasts and subsequent infection. However, in this study population HIV infection was clearly the predominant risk factor."
44,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels in plasma are currently widely used clinically for prognostication and in monitoring antiretroviral therapy. Accurate and reproducible results are critical for patient management. To determine the effects of specimen collection and handling procedures on quantitative measurement of HIV-1 RNA, we compared anticoagulants and sample processing times. Whole blood was collected from 20 HIV-1-infected patients in EDTA, acid citrate dextrose (ACD), and heparin tubes, aliquoted, and stored at room temperature. Plasma was separated from whole-blood aliquots prepared at < or =1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h postcollection and then stored at -70 degrees C until use. HIV-1 RNA levels were determined by the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR assay. Heparinized plasma samples, which were pretreated with heparinase prior to analysis, had the lowest baseline HIV-1 RNA levels. In the first 6 h, HIV-1 RNA levels decreased by 10, 20, and 31% in EDTA, ACD, and heparin tubes, respectively. From 6 to 48 h postcollection, HIV-1 RNA levels decreased in all anticoagulants, albeit at a slower, more consistent rate. Our results indicate that EDTA should be the anticoagulant of choice for plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement by reverse transcriptase PCR, but ACD tubes are acceptable if the plasma is separated within 6 h of blood collection. Caution must be applied in the interpretation of absolute HIV-1 RNA copy number values obtained with suboptimal specimen collection and processing procedures."
5021,0.003,3.0,"The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the neurological manifestations of HIV infection, CD4+ lymphocyte count and the levels of HIV-1 RNA (viral load) in plasma. A total of 62 adult antiretroviral naïve HIV infected patients were enrolled in the study. Among them 26 had neurological complications of HIV infection (1st group), 16 patients had symptomatic disease without neurological involvements (2nd group) and 20 were asymptomatic patients (control group). Measurement of CD4 count was performed by indirect immunofluorescent assay by using the monoclonal antibodies and viral load (VL) in plasma--by RT PCR method. CD4 count was significantly lower in the 1st and 2nd group compared to the control group. There was correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation. VL was comparable between the 1st and 2nd groups and was higher than in control group. There is a significant correlation between the level of CD4 count and type of neurological manifestation of HIV infection. Presence of neurological complication as well as other clinical manifestations is associated with decreased CD4 count and increased VL. Level of CD4 count can serve as an indicator for initiation of prophylaxis treatment of certain opportunistic pathogens."
7825,0.003,3.0,"Non invasive liver fibrosis scores have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy in hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infected patients. We assessed the impact of antiviral treatment on non invasive serological markers of liver fibrosis in HIV-HCV co-infected patients who received 48-weeks of HCV treatment. In HIV-HCV co-infected patients, HCV clearance was associated with a significant reduction in non invasive fibrosis serological markers, which most likely reflect the histological improvement associated with sustained virologic response. We assessed the association between insulin resistance, liver fibrosis, and liver steatosis in HIV-HCV and HCV-infected patients. Insulin resistance was associated with liver fibrosis and steatosis in HCV mono-infected but not in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Significant liver fibrosis was associated with insulin resistance independent of liver steatosis only in HCV mono-infected patients. We also assessed the impact of insulin resistance on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. A high HOMA-IR level was frequently found in HIV-HCV co-infected patients and was associated with a reduced sustained virologic response rate. Improving insulin sensitivity may be a useful adjunct to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients."

5823,0.003,3.0,"Nevirapine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as part of combination therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Nevirapine may be prescribed for patients with hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Significant autoinduction of cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2B6 following multiple dosing prompted an assessment of the metabolic profiles in patients with liver disease receiving chronic nevirapine therapy. HIV-infected patients with hepatic fibrosis who were receiving a stable antiretroviral regimen containing nevirapine for > or = 6 weeks had liver biopsy specimens assessed by Ishak histologic scoring and were grouped by severity (group 1, Ishak scores of 1 and 2; group 2, Ishak scores of 3 and 4; group 3, Ishak scores of 5 and 6). Steady-state trough nevirapine levels were determined for all patients, and additional measurements were obtained at 1, 2, and 4 h following nevirapine dosing for a subset of patients. The pharmacokinetics of nevirapine and its five metabolites were characterized, and a comparison of the results for the different Ishak groups was performed. Among 51 patients with hepatic fibrosis, the majority of whom were coinfected with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, differences between the maximum and the minimum observed plasma concentrations demonstrated a statistically significant flattening of the systemic exposure curves with progression from Ishak group 1 to Ishak group 2 or 3, suggesting a decrease in systemic clearance with the progression of liver disease. However, there were no significant differences in the trough and the maximum nevirapine concentrations between the Ishak groups. The metabolite profiles were also comparable across the Ishak groups. In HIV-infected patients who were chronically treated with nevirapine and who had various degrees of hepatic fibrosis, including cirrhosis, trough plasma nevirapine concentrations were not significantly increased, and thus, no dose adjustment is warranted."
4070,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease in patients on hemodialysis. As no useful noninvasive predictors of disease activity and fibrosis have been found, liver biopsy is essential in these patients to accurately assess the severity of disease and thus the prognosis and plan management. The present study was undertaken to assess the degree of severity of necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis in liver biopsies of patients on hemodialysis with chronic HCV infection. Liver biopsies obtained from 45 patients on hemodialysis with serological evidence of chronic hepatitis C were studied. The grading of necroinflammatory activity and staging of fibrosis were histologically assessed. The majority of patients (30, i.e. 66.7%) had mild disease with mild inflammatory activity and stage 0, 1 or 2 fibrosis. There was no significant correlation between the degree of fibrosis and the age of the patients (rs = 0.015), the duration of hemodialysis (rs = 0.047) or the presence of steatosis (rs = 0.064). There was a positive correlation between the presence of bile ductular proliferation and the severity of fibrosis (rs = 0.612). It was concluded that chronic HCV infection in hemodialysis patients is relatively mild early in its course. However, serial follow-up liver biopsies are mandatory to plan appropriate intervention strategies."
2708,0.003,3.0,"The process of transcriptional activation directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) was investigated by in vivo footprinting using ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction in a human epithelial cell line infected with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6). Infection with both viruses induces a remarkable enhancement in LTR-mediated gene expression that correlates with a change in the pattern of protein binding to the downstream kappa B site of the enhancer region. In HHV-6 infected cells, this change in the genomic footprinting pattern is concomitant with the induction of specific enhancer-binding proteins in the nucleus. The similarity of these events to those detected in other previously investigated experimental systems suggests that the LTR enhancer region is the ultimate target for the induction of the HIV-1 transcriptional response upon stimuli acting through different upstream pathways."
4202,0.003,3.0,"Little is known about the direct cytopathic effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its association with particular viral genotype or genetic mutation. In some immunosuppressed chronic HBV patients who had liver transplantation or HIV-coinfection, high viremia and liver fibrosis may occur. These findings suggest that hepatic injuries could arise in the absence of a mature immune system and the difference of genotype and/or specific mutation would affect cytopathic potential of the virus. We investigate HBV genotype-related differences in viral replication, antigens expression and histopathology using in vitro replication model or uPA/SCID mice harboring human hepatocytes, demonstrating that different HBV genotypes and even particular mutation are associated with different virological and histopathological characteristics. Infection with HBV/C2 as well as PC mutant of the HBV/B1 in immunosuppressive conditions can induce direct cytopathic effect in ""humanized"" part of the murine liver."
2302,0.003,3.0,"The genetic diversity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains has evolved through mutations such as point mutations, deletions or insertions, and recombination. We identified and characterized a novel type of mutation which is a complex of external insertion, deletion, and internal duplication in sequences from one of six patients with chronic hepatitis B virus genotype E (HBV/E). We provisionally named this mutation a ""replacement mutation""; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with a part of the S1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower hepatitis B (HB) e antigen titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding. Additionally, this HNF1 site replacement mutation was associated with excessive HB nucleocapsid protein expression in hepatocytes, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This novel mutation may be specific to HBV genotype E, and its prevalence requires further investigation."
22,0.003,3.0,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 functions as a bimodal tether during lentiviral DNA integration: its C-terminal integrase-binding domain interacts with the viral preintegration complex, whereas the N-terminal PWWP domain can bind to cellular chromatin. The molecular basis for the integrase-LEDGF/p75 interaction is understood, while the mechanism of chromatin binding is unknown. The PWWP domain is homologous to other protein interaction modules that together comprise the Tudor clan. Based on primary amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structural similarities, 24 residues of the LEDGF/p75 PWWP domain were mutagenized to garner essential details of its function during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mutating either Trp-21 or Ala-51, which line the inner wall of a hydrophobic cavity that is common to Tudor clan members, disrupts chromatin binding and virus infectivity. Consistent with a role for chromatin-associated LEDGF/p75 in stimulating integrase activity during infection, recombinant W21A protein is preferentially defective for enhancing integration into chromatinized target DNA in vitro. The A51P mutation corresponds to the S270P change in DNA methyltransferase 3B that causes human immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, and facial anomaly syndrome, revealing a critical role for this amino acid position in the chromatin binding functions of varied PWWP domains. Our results furthermore highlight the requirement for a conserved Glu in the hydrophobic core that mediates interactions between other Tudor clan members and their substrates. This initial systematic mutagenesis of a PWWP domain identifies amino acid residues critical for chromatin binding function and the consequences of their changes on HIV-1 integration and infection."
5086,0.003,3.0,"Conceptually, blocking human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integration is the last possibility for preventing irreversible cellular infection. Using cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and CD4(+) T cells, which represent primary targets in sexual transmission, we demonstrated that blocking integration with integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTIs), particularly L-870812, could consistently block cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 infection. In a pretreatment setting in which the compound was present before and during infection and was afterwards gradually diluted during the culture period, the naphthyridine carboxamide L-870812 blocked infection with the cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 Ba-L strain at concentrations of, respectively, 1,000 and 10,000 nM. The potency of L-870812 was similar to that of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor R-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (PMPA) but one or two orders of magnitude lower than those of the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC781 and TMC120. In contrast, the diketo acid RDS derivative InSTIs showed clear-cut but weaker antiviral activity than L-870812. Moreover, L-870812 completely blocked subtype C and CRFO2_AG primary isolates, which are prevalent in the African heterosexual epidemic. Furthermore, the addition of micromolar concentrations of L-870812 even 24 h after infection could still block both cell-free and cell-associated Ba-L, opening the prospect of postexposure prophylaxis. Finally, an evaluation of the combined activity of L-870812 with either T20, zidovudine, PMPA, UC781, or TMC120 against replication-deficient HIV-1 Ba-L (env) pseudovirus suggested synergistic activity for all combinations. Importantly, compounds selected for the study by using the coculture model were devoid of acute or delayed cytotoxic effects at HIV-blocking concentrations. Therefore, these findings provide evidence supporting consideration of HIV-1 integration as a target for microbicide development."
1603,0.003,3.0,"Lentiviral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) show great promise as gene carriers for future gene therapy. Insertion of a fragment containing the central polypurine tract (cPPT) in HIV-1 vector constructs is known to enhance transduction efficiency drastically, reportedly by facilitating the nuclear import of HIV-1 cDNA through a central DNA flap. We have studied the impact of the cPPT on the kinetics of HIV-1 vector transduction by real-time PCR. The kinetics of total HIV-1 DNA, two-long-terminal-repeat (2-LTR) circles, and, by an Alu-PCR, integrated proviral DNA were monitored. About 6 to 12 h after transduction, the total HIV-1 DNA reached a maximum level, followed by a steep decrease. The 2-LTR circles peaked after 24 to 48 h and were diluted upon cell division. Integration of HIV-1 DNA was first detected at 12 h postinfection. When HIV-1 vectors that contained the cPPT were used, DNA synthesis was similar but a threefold higher amount of 2-LTR circles was detected, confirming the impact on nuclear import. Moreover, a 10-fold increase in the amount of integrated DNA was observed in the presence of the cPPT. Only in the absence of the cPPT was a saturation in 2-LTR circle formation seen at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting a role for the cPPT in overcoming a barrier to the nuclear import of HIV-1 DNA. A major effect of the central DNA flap on the juxtaposition of both LTRs is unlikely, since transduction with HIV-1 vectors containing ectopic cPPT fragments resulted in increased amounts of 2-LTR circles as well as integrated DNA. Inhibitors of transduction by cPPT-containing HIV vectors were also studied by real-time PCR. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine (AZT) and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor alpha-APA clearly inhibited viral DNA synthesis, whereas integrase inhibitors such as the diketo acid L-708,906 and the pyranodipyrimidine V-165 specifically inhibited integration."
2587,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity has been suggested to correlate with protection from progression to AIDS. We have examined the relationship between HIV-specific CTL activity and maintenance of peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocyte counts and control of viral load in 17 long-term survivors (LTSs) of HIV-1 infection. Longitudinal analysis indicated that the LTS cohort demonstrated a decreased rate of CD4+ T cell loss (18 cells/mm3/year) compared with typical normal progressors (approximately 60 cells/mm3/year). The majority of the LTSs had detectable, variable, and in some individuals, quite high (>10(4) RNA copies/ml) plasma viral load during the study period. In a cross-sectional analysis, HIV-specific CTL activity to HIV Gag, Pol, and Env proteins was detectable in all 17 LTSs. Simultaneous analysis of HIV-1 Gag-Pol, and Env-specific CTLs and virus load in protease inhibitor-naive individuals showed a significant inverse correlation between Pol-specific CTL activity and plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (p = 0.001). Furthermore, using a mixed linear effects model the combined effects of HIV-1 Pol- and Env-specific CTL activity on the viral load were significantly stronger than the effects of HIV-1 Pol-specific CTL activity alone on predicted virus load. These data suggest that the presence of HIV-1-specific CTL activity in HIV-1-infected long-term survivors is an important component in the effective control of HIV-1 replication."

6820,0.003,3.0,"Perceived social standing (PSS) was evaluated as a determinant of differences in health outcomes among Ugandan HIV-infected adults from Kampala using cross-sectional study design. PSS was defined using the MacArthur scale of subjective social status translated and adapted for the study setting. Socio-demographic and psychosocial correlates of PSS ranking at enrollment were determined using linear regression models. High versus low PSS was defined based on the median PSS score and evaluated as a determinant of body mass index, hemoglobin, quality of life (QOL) and frailty-related phenotype via linear regression. A log-binomial regression model estimated the relative-risk of good, very good or excellent versus fair or poor self-rated health (SRH) in relation to PSS. Older age, increasing social support and material wealth were correlated with high PSS ranking, whereas female sex, experience of multiple stigmas and multiple depressive symptoms were correlated with low PSS ranking. High PSS participants were on average 1.1 kg/m(2) heavier, had 4.7 % lower frailty scores and 3.6 % higher QOL scores compared to low PSS patients (all p < 0.05); they were also more likely to self-classify as high SRH (RR 1.4, 95 % confidence interval 1.1, 1.7) but had comparable hemoglobin levels (p = 0.634). Low PSS correlated with poor physical and psychosocial wellbeing in HIV-positive Ugandan adults. The assessment of PSS as part of clinical management, combined with efforts to reduce stigma and improve social support, may identify and possibly reduce PSS-associated health inequality in Ugandan adults with HIV."
6020,0.003,3.0,"Scaling up access to HIV viral load testing for individuals undergoing antiretroviral therapy in low-resource settings is a global health priority, as emphasised by research showing the benefits of suppressed viral load for the individual and the whole population. Historically, large-scale diagnostic test implementation has been slow and incomplete because of service delivery and other challenges. Building on lessons from the past, in this Personal View we propose a new framework to accelerate viral load scale-up and ensure equitable access to this essential test. The framework includes the following steps: (1) ensuring adequate financial investment in scaling up this test; (2) achieving pricing agreements and consolidating procurement to lower prices of the test; (3) strengthening functional tiered laboratory networks and systems to expand access to reliable, high-quality testing across countries; (4) strengthening national leadership, with prioritisation of laboratory services; and (5) demand creation and uptake of test results by clinicians, nurses, and patients, which will be vital in ensuring viral load tests are appropriately used to improve the quality of care. The use of dried blood spots to stabilise and ship samples from clinics to laboratories, and the use of point-of-care diagnostic tests, will also be important for ensuring access, especially in settings with reduced laboratory capacity. For countries that have just started to scale up viral load testing, lessons can be learnt from countries such as Botswana, Brazil, South Africa, and Thailand, which have already established viral load programmes. This framework might be useful for guiding the implementation of viral load with the aim of achieving the new global HIV 90-90-90 goals by 2020."
5712,0.003,3.0,"Acute HIV-1 infection is often diagnosed as infectious mononucleosis and the symptoms resolve spontaneously after varying periods of time. After the infection of HIV-1 through the mucosa, the characteristic clinical symptoms and laboratory markers of acute HIV-1 infection appear in each patient through a complicated virus-host interaction. To understand the host responses, we measured two unique proinflammatory cytokines, galectin-9 (Gal-9) and osteopontin (OPN). A β-galactoside-binding mammalian lectin, Gal-9, reduces pro-inflammatory type-1 helper T (Th1) cells and Th17 cells and increases anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. The plasma level of Gal-9 is known to be associated with HIV-1 viral load in chronic HIV-1 infection. On the contrary, osteopontin induces Th1/Th17 cells and promotes tissue inflammation. OPN is synthesized by variety of cells in the body, and dendritic cells are known to synthesize OPN in HIV-1 infected individuals. It was hypothesized that Gal-9 and/or OPN could be not only immune-modulators but also novel biomarkers of acute HIV-1 infection. We experienced 3 patients with acute HIV-1 and measured the levels of Gal-9 and OPN periodically before and after antiretroviral treatment. The results showed that the plasma levels of Gal-9 were extremely elevated [more than 2,300 pg/ml (normal range < 46 pg/ml)] in all three acute HIV-1 infected individuals and decreased rapidly after treatment. The changes in the OPN levels were less marked. In conclusion, the plasma levels of Gal-9 may be predictive of a severe inflammation status during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection and could be a potential biomarker during acute infection."

In order to assess this chemokine in central nervous system (CNS) HIV infection, we measured the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of CXCL10 by immunoassay in samples derived from 97 HIV-infected subjects across a spectrum of immunological progression and CNS complications and from 16 HIV seronegative control subjects studied at three clinical centers between 1994 and 2001. We also examined changes in the CSF and plasma CXCL10 concentrations in 30 subjects starting and three stopping antiretroviral therapy. CSF CXCL10 concentrations: (1) correlated with CSF HIV RNA and white blood cell (WBC) counts, but not with blood CXCL10, HIV RNA, or CD4 counts; (2) were increased in subjects with primary and asymptomatic HIV infections and AIDS dementia complex, but less frequently in those with more advanced infection, with or without CNS opportunistic diseases except cytomegalovirus encephalitis; (3) decreased in subjects starting antiretroviral in association with decreases in CSF and plasma HIV RNA and CSF WBCs; and (4) conversely, increased in subjects stopping treatment in parallel with CSF HIV RNA and WBCs. These results confirm that CSF CXCL10 associates closely with both CSF HIV and WBCs and suggest that this chemokine may be both a response to and contributing determinant of local infection. High CSF levels may be useful in the diagnosis of ADC in subjects with advanced immunosuppression in whom CMV encephalitis has been ruled out, though this issue requires further study."
268,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 disease is associated with pathological effects on T-cell production, destruction, and distribution. Using the deuterated (2H) glucose method for endogenous labeling, we have analyzed host factors that influence T-cell turnover in HIV-1-uninfected and -infected humans. In untreated HIV-1 disease, the average half life of circulating T cells was diminished without compensatory increases in cell production. Within 12 weeks of the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the absolute production rates of circulating T cells increased, and normal half-lives and production rates were restored by 12-36 months. Interpatient heterogeneity in the absolute degree of turnover correlated with the relative proportion of naive- and memory/effector-phenotype T cells in each of the CD4+ and CD8+ populations. The half-lives of naive-phenotype T cells ranged from 116-365 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.19-0.60% per day), whereas memory/effector-phenotype T cells persisted with half-lives from 22-79 days (fractional replacement rates of 0.87-3.14% per day). Naive-phenotype T cells were more abundant, and the half-life of total T cells was prolonged in individuals with abundant thymic tissue, as assessed by computed tomography. Such interpatient variation in T-cell kinetics may be reflective of differences in functional immune reconstitution after treatment for HIV-1 disease."
391,0.003,3.0,"Traditional healers provide healthcare to a substantial proportion of people living with HIV infection (PLHIV) in high HIV burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the impact on the health of retained patients visiting traditional healers is unknown. In 2011, a study to asses adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) performed in 18 purposefully selected HIV treatment centers in Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda showed that 'consulting a traditional healer/herbalist because of HIV' was an independent risk factor for incomplete ART adherence. To identify characteristics of PLHIV on ART who were also consulting traditional healers, we conducted a secondary analysis of the data from this study. It was found that 260 (5.8%) of the 4451 patients enrolled in the study had consulted a traditional healer during the last three months because of HIV. In multivariable analysis, patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who had been on ART for >5.3 years and those from Tanzania were more likely to have consulted a traditional healer. However, at the time of the study, there was a famous healer in Manyara district, Loliondo village of Tanzania who claimed his herbal remedy was able to cure all chronic diseases including HIV. HIV treatment programs should be aware that patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who have been on ART for five or more years, and patients attending ART centers near famous traditional healers are likely to consult traditional healers. Such patients may need more support or counseling about the risks of both stopping ART and poor adherence. Considering the realities of inadequate human resources for health and the burden of disease caused by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating a collaboration between allopathic and traditional health practitioners is recommended."
4355,0.003,3.0,"We studied barriers to HIV care among HIV-positive Latinos in the US-Mexico border region, where HIV prevalence is increasing. HIV-positive participants receiving HIV care were recruited from clinics in Southern California and underwent structured interviews (n = 157). Logistic regression explored covariates associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care. HIV-positive patients were mostly male (84.7%), of Mexican-origin (82.8%), and had a mean age of 37.3 years. Among males (n = 133), 67% identified as men who have sex with men. In the prior year, patients received the following care in Mexico: HIV care (33.1%), non-HIV care (43.3%), prescription medications (51.6%), and traditional medications/herbs (17.2%). The most common barriers to HIV care included stigma and medication side effects concerns. Factors independently associated with > or =1 barrier to HIV care were HIV diagnosis >1 year ago; being of Mexican-origin; crossing the US-Mexico border <5 times in the past year; obtaining medications in Mexico; and age. Findings illustrate that bi-national health care utilization is common, which has implications for HIV service delivery in both countries. Additional studies are needed to better understand individual, provider and system level barriers to HIV care in the San Diego/Tijuana border region."

However, it is technically difficult to demonstrate CTL responses consistently in nonhuman primate and human subjects using traditional cytotoxicity assay methods. In this study, we systematically evaluated culture conditions that may affect the proliferation and expansion of CTL effector cells and presented a sensitive method for detection of cytotoxicity responses with bulk CTL cultures. We confirmed the sensitivity and specificity of this method by demonstration of vigorous CTL responses in a simian-HIV (SHIV)-infected rhesus macaque. The expansion of epitope-specific CTL effector cells was also measured quantitatively by CTL epitope-major histocompatibility complex tetramer complex staining. In addition, two new T-cell determinants in the SIV gag region are identified. Last, we showed the utility of this method for studying CTL responses in chimpanzee and human subjects."
9020,0.003,3.0,"There is an increase in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity in individuals infected with HIV that may be due to inflammatory lipid modulation not captured by traditional lipid measures. The objective of this study was to perform advanced lipoprotein phenotyping inclusive of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol efflux capacity and lipoprotein particle concentration and size in a well-phenotyped group of 118 patients infected with HIV. We used simple and multivariable analyses to determine the associations between advanced lipoprotein parameters and known cardiometabolic risk factors. Participants were on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART) and had benign traditional lipid panels [median total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides of 178 mg/dl, 108 mg/dl, 44 mg/dl, and 122.5 mg/dl, respectively]. However, advanced lipoprotein phenotyping demonstrated an elevation of LDL particle number (median of 1,233 nmol/liter) and a decrease in LDL size (median of 20.4 nm), along with a decrease in protective, large HDL particles (median of 3.15 μmol/liter) and reduced HDL cholesterol efflux capacity in comparison to controls of other studies. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with HDL levels (β=0.395, p<0.001), small LDL particle concentration (β=-0.198, p=0.031), insulin sensitivity by the Matsuda index (β=0.218, p=0.029), and the Framingham Risk Score (β=-0.184, p=0.046).

Awareness of HTLV-1 and related condition should be encouraged in this region and routine screening should be applied to blood donors.
525,0.003,3.0,"A health care worker (HCW) was infected via needlestick with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 from a subject with AIDS who harbored a zidovudine-resistant, syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV strain. The phenotypic characteristics of the HIV-1 isolates obtained from the HCW and markers of virus load were followed for 20 months. Although the HCW was initially infected with an SI strain, within 75 days of infection the isolate became non-SI and remained so for > or = 635 days. Even though the AIDS patient had a zidovudine-resistant virus, the HCW was infected with a zidovudine-sensitive virus. Plasma RNA levels peaked 20 days after infection, declined rapidly within 2 weeks, and remained stable for the duration of follow-up. Similarly, the HCW's CD4 lymphocyte count remained stable throughout the study. Thus, selection for non-SI and zidovudine-sensitive virus occurred in the HCW, who, after initial symptomatic infection associated with high levels of plasma HIV-1 RNA, developed low plasma RNA copy numbers and stable CD4 lymphocyte counts."
8674,0.003,3.0,"Malnutrition, skeletal muscle wasting, and changes in cardiac muscle mass and function have been described in children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This report analyzes the relation of nutritional status to cardiac muscle mass and function in HIV-infected children. Thirty-six children with symptomatic HIV infection underwent simultaneous anthropometric and echocardiographic evaluations before antiretroviral therapy or supplemental feedings. Nutritional measurements included weight, height, triceps skinfold thickness, and arm muscle circumference. Cardiac measurements included left ventricular mass, contractility, end-diastolic dimension, fractional shortening, blood pressure, and heart rate. In a cross-sectional analysis, children infected with HIV were significantly below age-adjusted standards for height (P = 0.0001), weight (P = 0.0001), triceps skinfold thickness (P = 0.001), and arm muscle circumference (P = 0.04). Left ventricular mass normalized to body surface area was below standard, but contractility was normal. Correlation analyses found an inverse relation between left ventricular mass and weight z score (r = -0.45, P = 0.01), height z score (r = -0.47, P = 0.006), and arm muscle circumference percentile (r = -0.51, P = 0.003). An inverse relation was also found between heart rate and weight z score (r = -0.47, P = 0.007) and arm muscle circumference percentile (r = -0.46, P = 0.007). In malnourished children with HIV infection, a paradoxical relation exists between nutritional status and cardiac muscle mass. The inverse relation between heart rate and nutritional status may suggest altered metabolic rates with possible increased sympathetic tone."

1502,0.003,3.0,"The risk of mycobacterial disease is significantly increased in drug abusers as well as in immunocompromised HIV-1-infected individuals. The essential trace element selenium has an important function in maintaining immune processes and may, thus, have a critical role in clearance of mycobacteria. The impact of selenium status on the development of mycobacterial diseases in HIV-1-seropositive drug users was investigated over a 2-year period (1999-2001). Twelve cases of mycobacterial disease (tuberculosis, 9; infection due to atypical Mycobacterium species, 3) occurred; these 12 cases were compared with 32 controls with no history of respiratory infections who were matched on age, sex, and HIV status. Significant risk for development of mycobacterial disease was associated with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm 3, malnutrition, and selenium levels of <or=135 microg/L (patients with these levels were 13 times more likely to develop mycobacterial disease). Multivariate analyses controlling for antiretroviral treatment and CD4 cell count revealed that both body mass index and selenium level remained significant factors in the relative risk for developing mycobacterial disease (relative risk, 3; p =.015); these findings suggest that selenium status may have a profound impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterial disease."
4145,0.003,3.0,"CR2 (CD21), the EBV receptor, was detected on three of four CD4-positive cell lines by indirect fluorescent labeling, and its corresponding mRNA was found by use of the reverse transcription-based polymerase chain reaction. To determine whether CR2 on CD4-positive cells was functional, their ability to be infected by EBV was analyzed. EBV DNA, EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2A), and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER1) transcripts could be detected in CR2-expressing CD4-positive cells following infection by the B95.8 strain of EBV. Analysis of the terminal region showed the EBV genome remained linear following infection, and copy number decreased with time. Since CD4-positive cell lines are targets for HIV-1 infection, the effects of EBV infection on HIV-1 expression were analyzed. HIV-1 replication was upregulated when CD4-positive cells were coinfected with EBV strain B95.8 but not P3HR-1K. These results suggested that EBNA-2 is involved in upregulation of HIV-1 expression in T lymphoblastoid cell lines. To test this hypothesis an EBNA-2-expression vector was transfected into T lymphoblastoid cell lines and HIV-1 expression measured. First, trans-activation of HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) by Tat was enhanced by EBNA-2 type 1 expression. trans-Activation of the HIV-1 LTR by Tat was also enhanced when CD4-positive cells were infected by EBV (strain B95.8) encoding an intact EBNA-2, but not by P3HR-1K with a deleted EBNA-2. In addition, CD4-positive cell clones stably expressing EBNA-2 supported enhanced HIV-1 replication as measured by accumulation of reverse transcriptase activity and syncytium induction. This provides direct evidence that EBV infection can enhance HIV-1 replication in T cells. Whether this in vitro phenomenon contributes to disease progression in vivo remains to be determined."
2433,0.003,3.0,"A region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp 120 has been claimed previously to be homologous to parts of snake venom neurotoxins and rabies virus glycoprotein (""the neurotoxic loop""). We have determined DNA sequences directly from a polymerase chain reaction amplified fragment corresponding to this region of HIV-1 gp 120 and have translated these to protein sequences. This was performed with the prototype HIVSF2 isolate and several Swedish HIV-1 strains, which were precultivated from blood cells or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or were directly obtained from CSF cells of patients with and without neurological symptoms. The results show that there are sequence similarities between a short segment of gp120 of clinical HIV-1 strains and the neurotoxic loop. The strains of patients with neurological symptoms did not, however, show a genetic shift of their sequences towards a greater similarity to the sequences of snake venom neurotoxins and rabies virus glycoprotein as compared to the strains of asymptomatic individuals."
2489,0.003,3.0,"The T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of 24 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected children were determined by flow cytometry in combination with sequencing of the highly variable TCR complementarity-determining region 3, permitting a quantitative and qualitative assessment of TCR repertoire. Expanded subsets of CD8(+) cells expressing a particular TCR beta-chain variable region were more commonly identified in HIV-1-infected children than in healthy control subjects (75% vs. 13.5%; P<.0001). Older age and lower percentage of CD4(+) cells were correlated with expansions. Oligoclonal populations occupied 71%-95% of each expanded subset, and predominant clones had high absolute counts. There was evidence of functional differentiation to CD28(-) effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cells bearing identical TCRs were identified in both CD28(+) and CD28(-) cell populations. HIV-1 specificity was observed for expanded clones. Children with expansions were not more likely to have increased numbers of CD8(+) T cells, a finding consistent with the possibility that the CD8(+) TCR repertoire has limited diversity."

We aimed to describe the epidemiological, virological and clinical characteristics of HBV infections newly diagnosed in 2011 in University hospitals of Marseille, the second largest French city. HBV serology was performed for 18,130 sera from 15,744 patients. A total of 167 patients were newly-diagnosed with HBV based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis B core antibodies. Clinico-epidemiological features were analyzed for 78 patients. Patients included a majority of men (59%), women being significantly younger with a mean age of 36 ± 17 versus 43.5 ± 16.2 years (P = 0.009). Country of birth was available for 52 patients and 35% of them originated from sub-Saharan Africa. Levels of the liver biological parameters were significantly lower in women compared to men, in whom mean alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase levels were 24 ± 39 versus 37 ± 36 IU/l (P = 0.0001) and 20 ± 20 versus 51 ± 53 IU/l (P = 0.0001), respectively. Co-infections with hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses were found in 5% and 6% of the patients, respectively. HBV DNA was detectable in 90% of the HBeAg-negative patients. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the HBsAg titer and the HBV DNA level (P = 0.001). Genotype D was the most common HBV genotype and was found in 53% of the patients tested, followed by genotype E (21%). HBV remains a major concern with a slightly greater number of new diagnoses than in 2004. HBV genetic diversity was substantial in the present cohort."
6976,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of intrahepatic delta antigen and/or anti-delta antibody was retrospectively investigated in 102 children with chronic HBsAg-positive hepatitis who were seen consecutively in three medical institutions between 1974 and 1982. Delta infection markers were found in 13 patients (12.7%) who exhibited high serum titers of anti-delta antibody; intrahepatic delta antigen was detected in ten. Eleven of the 13 children had severe progressive liver disease associated in all but one with absence of hepatitis B virus replication as evaluated by analysis of serum hepatitis B virus DNA. The factors which seem to increase the risk of delta infection in children who are hepatitis B virus carriers are geographic origin, a history of exposure to blood derivatives and age. A further 37 of 102 children had chronic active hepatitis (20 patients) or cirrhosis (17 patients) without evidence of delta infection. These results indicate that delta infection occurs in children with chronic hepatitis. This possibility should be considered in investigation of children with HBsAg-positive chronic liver disease. Although the delta agent is an important cause of progressive liver disease in children who are chronic HBsAg carriers, severe liver injury and especially cirrhosis can occur without evidence of delta infection."

This study sought to determine the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive attendees of the Directly Observed Treatment of Short Course (DOTS) program at the military hospital in Port Harcourt. The association of HIV prevalence with gender and age as risk factors was also determined. A total of 200 patients aged 15-65 years were screened. Re-screening for HIV was done for confirmation. The overall prevalence for anti-TB antibodies amongst HIV-positive individuals was 14.0% (7.5% in males and 6.5% in females) while HIV prevalence following re-screening was 92%. It was observed that based on employment status and level of education, the highest HIV prevalence was seen in unemployed individuals and individuals with no formal education. The result showed that 29.9% of the HIV seropositives were males while 70.1% were females. Sex-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups indicated significantly higher co-infection rates (P < 0.05) among males (23.1%) than females (9.6%). Age-related prevalence of HIV-TB coinfection within groups showed that co-infection was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in ages below 30 years (21.2%) than in their counterparts 30 years and above (9.6%). This study confirmed the presence of TB co-infections among HIV-positive individuals in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Considering the role of TB in driving the HIV pandemic, it is imperative that HIV-positive patients are screened for TB infection regularly to reduce the scale of active HIV-TB co-infection."
6067,0.003,3.0,"Chronic coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with adverse liver outcomes. The clinical impact of previous HBV infection on liver disease in HCV infection is unknown. We aimed at determining any association of previous HBV infection with liver outcomes using antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) positivity as a marker of exposure. The Scottish Hepatitis C Clinical Database containing data for all patients attending HCV clinics in participating health boards was linked to the HBV diagnostic registry and mortality data from Information Services Division, Scotland. Survival analyses with competing risks were constructed for time from the first appointment to decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related mortality. Records of 8513 chronic HCV patients were included in the analyses (87 HBcAb positive and HBV surface antigen [HBsAg] positive, 1577 HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative, and 6849 HBcAb negative). Multivariate cause-specific proportional hazards models showed previous HBV infection (HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative) significantly increased the risks of decompensated cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.01-1.65) and HCC (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.09-2.49), but not liver-related death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). This is the largest study to date showing an association between previous HBV infection and certain adverse liver outcomes in HCV infection. Our analyses add significantly to evidence which suggests that HBV infection adversely affects liver health despite apparent clearance. This has important implications for HBV vaccination policy and indications for prioritization of HCV therapy."
7302,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence and associated factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected men remain controversial. The authors evaluated ED, clinical, and emotional variables in a group of 501 HIV-infected men in a cross-sectional 4-month observational study. ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 and emotional status using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) questionnaire. Median age (interquartile range) was 42 (35, 48) years. Time since HIV diagnosis was 6.3 (2.6, 17.1) years, 92% were taking antiretroviral treatment and 81.8% had an HIV-RNA viral load <50 copies. The prevalence of ED was 58.5%. ED was mild in 30.1%, mild to moderate in 19.5%, moderate in 6.1%, and severe in 2.5%. ED medications were used by 19% of men. In the univariate analysis, the variables associated with all degrees of ED were older age, longer time since HIV diagnosis, higher scores in HAD, not taking efavirenz, taking etravirine, taking ritonavir, HIV/Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, and taking a protease inhibitor-containing regimen. For mild to moderate, moderate, and severe ED, the same variables were significant, as were lower nadir CD4 cell count, lower social support, taking atazanavir, concomitant conditions, and concomitant treatments. The variables that remained significant in the multivariate analyses, considering all degrees of ED or excluding mild ED were the following: older age and higher scores in HAD total. In summary, ED affected more than half of this cohort of well controlled HIV-infected men. Age and emotional status seemed to play a fundamental role in its presence."

4457,0.003,3.0,"Viruses have been found to exhibit protein kinase activity associated with their purified viral particles. HIV-1 virus particles possess a novel 72 kD protein, Topoisomerase II beta kinase (Topo IIβKHIV) activity. The enzyme, isolated and purified from PEGprecipitated HIV-1 particles, is insensitive against a diverse set of known kinase inhibitors. The pyridine derivatives were found to be active against both Topo IIβKHIV activity and HIV-1 replication. For both kinase antagonism and anti-HIV-1 activity the Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) models were proposed. The CoMFA model was also evaluated independently with a set of test molecules for their anti-viral activity. The kinase inhibition and anti-viral activities for these inhibitors, tested in an in vitro kinase agree with the CoMFA model (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.642 with six principal components), lower acceptable results are obtained with anti- HIV-1 activity (cross-validated r2 (q2) value of 0.358 with four principal components) and also correlate with relative solvation free energy calculations. The predictive power of the models was evaluated with 2 test molecules each and tends to lie within 1 log unit. An in cell validation of the model with a representative inhibitor, 2-methoxypyridine shows its ability to inhibit Topo IIβ phosphorylation during acute HIV-1 infection. Close correlation of molecular fields of inhibitory domains of kinase and HIV-1 inhibitors suggests specificity of action of pyridine derivatives in affecting HIV-1 replication through inhibition of Kinase activity. These investigations suggest that Topo IIβKHIV is a potential target for an effective control of HIV-1 replication that would help in developing new anti-retroviral molecules. "

In combination with other proven HIV-prevention methods, preexposure prophylaxis may be a useful tool for women at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the care of women using preexposure prophylaxis must reinforce adherence to daily medication. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance for preexposure prophylaxis is likely to evolve in the coming years, and obstetrician-gynecologists should remain aware of new developments in this area.

1326,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X-gene product activates transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under control of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). To identify a cis-acting regulatory sequence within the HIV-1 LTR which is responsive to the HBV X-gene trans-activating function, we examined the effects of HBV X-gene expression in cells with a series of LTR/CAT deletion mutants. A region of the HIV-1 LTR containing the previously identified kappa B-like enhancer element was found to be responsive to HBV X-gene activation, and this effect was independent of, and additive with, the effect of the HIV-1 tat-III protein on CAT expression. Since kappa B-like enhancer sequences are known to regulate transcription of a variety of viruses and cellular genes, our results suggest that the X gene could activate such a gene during HBV infection and replication."
1321,0.003,3.0,"Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) X-gene, previously shown to be capable of trans-activating heterologous regulatory elements of the human beta-interferon gene, the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), the simian virus 40 (SV40), and HBV, has the capacity to code for a 17-kDa polypeptide (designated pX17). We now report that pX17 synthesized in Escherichia coli can activate transcription controlled by the HIV-1 LTR using a protoplast fusion technique. Protoplasts of E. coli-containing presynthesized X-protein were fused with lymphocytic H938 cells harboring an integrated copy of a plasmid with the CAT gene under control of the HIV-1 LTR (HIV-1 LTR CAT) and a marked increase in the steady state expression of the CAT mRNA was observed. When the same fused cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide, the pX17-dependent activation of the HIV-1 LTR was abolished. This result indicates that the X-protein expressed in E. coli is biologically active and suggests that the HBV X-protein-mediated trans-activation of the HIV-1 LTR in this system requires de novo cellular protein synthesis."

We observed a case of genotypic ETVr with viral and biochemical breakthrough during ETV treatment of nucleoside-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). A 57-years-old HBeAg-positive man received ETV 0.5 mg/day for 145 weeks. HBV DNA was 7.7 log10 copies/ml at baseline, decreased to below 2 at week 48, declined to a nadir of 0 (negative) at week 72, and rebounded to 2.2 log10 copies/ ml at week 90 and remained this level until 109 weeks and increased to 6.8 log10 copies/ml at week 145. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level increased to 440 IU/L at week 145. The ETVr-related substitution (rtS202P) and lamivudine resistance-related substitutions (rtL180M+rtM204V) were detected by DNA sequencing analysis at week 145. The patient discontinued ETV therapy at week 145, and then received 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Afterwards, HBV DNA level dropped to below 2.6 log10 copies/ml and ALT level was normalized after 19 weeks of TDF dosing. The three substitutions associated with ETV and lamivudine resistance developed after complete viral suppression in a nucleoside-naive CHB patient during ETV treatment. In spite of the extremely rare chance of viral mutation during ETV treatment, nucleoside-naive patients should be carefully monitored for resistance even if complete suppression is present."
5867,0.003,3.0,"Lamivudine is a safe, effective treatment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after renal transplantation. However, prolonged lamivudine therapy can produce resistance to the drug. Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with lamivudine resistance, but there is limited clinical experience in patients with either renal transplants or severe renal insufficiency. A 47-year-old man with asymptomatic HBV infection underwent renal transplantation in November 1995. In September 2000 lamivudine therapy was initiated to treat HBV reactivation. The outcome was good, with negative HBV DNA levels. Two years later, significant viral replication developed again. At that time the patient already had advanced renal insufficiency due to chronic graft nephropathy. The transaminase levels were increased, and the HBV DNA reached greater than 200,000 copies/mL by polymerase chain reaction, with development of ascites and cirrhosis. The patient was started on ADV 10 mg every 72 hours (dose adjusted to renal function). There was rapid normalization of hepatic enzymes and progressive decline of the viral load. HBV DNA became negative after 6 months of ADV treatment. The renal function has since remained stable. This case suggests that ADV can be safe and effective in the treatment of renal transplant patients with lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B, even in the presence of advanced renal insufficiency."
5393,0.003,3.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. The etiology of liver cancer is multifactorial, and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis, or hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dietary exposure to aflatoxin B(1) all contribute to elevating one's risk for this disease. In this study, we sought to determine the contributions of these agents by measuring the occurrence of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation, an aflatoxin-specific 249(G-->T) mutation of the p53 gene, and HCV in plasma of 34 HCC cases and 68 age- and gender-matched controls, and in 25 liver tumors from northern Thailand. In total, 14 cases, 5 controls, and 19 tumors had detectable levels of HBV DNA. All 14 cases, 2 controls (2.9%), and 17 tumors (89.5%) were positive for the HBV double mutation. Nine cases (26.5%), 10 controls (14.7%), and 6 tumors (24%) were positive for the p53 mutation. Five cases (14.7%), no controls, and 4 tumors (16%) had both mutations. The median age of HCC diagnosis in these 5 cases was 34 years versus 51 years for other cases. Five cases (14.7%) and 1 control (1.5%) were HCV enzyme immunoassay positive. Thus, specific HBV, HCV, and aflatoxin biomarkers reveal the complexity of risks contributing to HCC in northern Thailand and suggest further application of these biomarkers as intermediate end points in prevention, intervention trials, and etiologic investigations."

Recent studies have associated HIV infections in Kenya with several invasive health care and cosmetic procedures. To explore the various blood exposures that could contribute to HIV infections in Kenya, we surveyed 320 adolescents and adults aged 15-29 years from the Luo and Kisii ethnic groups. Survey participants reported a wide range of invasive procedures in health care (including circumcisions, dental care, blood tests, and 1-60 injections or infusions for specific health problems), in cosmetic services (including tattooing and piercing) and around the home (through shaving body hair, fights, sports and other activities). Luo were significantly more likely than Kisii to report some risks (e.g. tattooing by a traditional expert, piercing), but less likely to report others (e.g. blood tests for malaria, anaesthetic injections during circumcision)."
1004,0.003,3.0,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) results in gradual immunosuppression due to the loss of CD4+ T cells. In the wake of immune system breakdown, infected individuals may acquire multiple opportunistic infections and develop certain malignancies which ultimately account for the vast majority of deaths in these persons. A limited number of malignancies are directly associated with HIV infection and suggest a common tie between these tumors. Inappropriate immune surveillance resulting in insufficient inhibition of virus replication and inadequate control of the growth of transformed cells may contribute to the development of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals. Alternatively, malignancies in HIV infection may be the consequence of immune dysregulation. Cellular immune responses mediated by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of particular importance for immunologic control of viral infections and substantial information has been gathered about theses cells in HIV infection. The goal of this review is therefore to summarize recent findings regarding the cellular immune response to HIV with a particular focus on cytokines released by HIV-specific CTL."
826,0.003,3.0,"Heterosexual transmission by vaginal intercourse accounts for most transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in Africa and Asia but is less important in the HIV-1 epidemics of the United States and Western Europe. Epithelial Langerhans' cells (LCs) represent a possible source of initial cell contact for vaginal infection. Fifteen primary isolates of HIV-1 from U.S. homosexuals and 18 HIV-1 isolates from Thailand heterosexuals were evaluated for growth in LCs of U.S. origin. All the viruses from the Thai heterosexuals, which were subtype E, grew more efficiently in the LCs than any of the viruses from the U.S. homosexuals, which are subtype B. These results suggest that LC tropism is associated with the efficiency of heterosexual transmission of HIV."
4356,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus genotype 4 (HCV-G4) is prevalent in the Middle East and Africa and has spread to several regions in Europe. HCV-G4 represents a major health problem in Egypt, with a prevalence rate of 13%. Recently, HCV-G4 has been spreading in Europe particularly among intravenous drug users (IDU) populations, who represent the main reservoir for HCV in Europe. This article reviews the current therapeutic strategies for HCV-G4 infections in different populations. HCV-G4 has been considered a difficult-to-treat genotype because of the poor sustained virological response (SVR) rates reported with a conventional interferon (IFN)-based regimen. Pegylated IFN and ribavirin combination therapy was associated with significant improvements in SVR rates that currently exceed 60%, particularly with individualized therapy. Lower response rates have been reported in specific situations, namely chronic HCV-G4 infection in IDUs and patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Rapid and early virological responses have been useful tools for determination of the duration of therapy."
3823,0.003,3.0,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a high risk for exposure to pathogens in the workplace. The objective of this study was to evaluate HCW adherence to follow-up after occupational exposure to blood and body fluids at a tertiary care university hospital in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected from 2102 occupational exposures to blood and body fluids reports, obtained from the Infection Control Division of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Escola Paulista de Medicina/Hospital São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil, occurring between January of 2005 and December of 2011. To evaluate adherence to post-exposure follow-up among the affected HCWs, we took into consideration follow-up visits for serological testing. For HCWs exposed to materials from source patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as from source patients of unknown serological status, follow-up serological testing was scheduled for 3 and 6 months after the accident. For those exposed to materials from source patients co-infected with HIV and HCV, follow-up evaluations were scheduled for 3, 6, and 12 months after the accident. During the study period, there were 2056 accidental exposures for which data regarding the serology of the source patient were available. Follow-up evaluation of the affected HCW was recommended in 612 (29.8%) of those incidents. After the implementation of a post-exposure protocol involving telephone calls and official letters mailed to the affected HCW, adherence to follow-up increased significantly, from 30.5 to 54.0% (P = 0.028). Adherence was correlated positively with being female (P = 0.009), with the source of the exposure being known (P = 0.026), with the source patient being HIV positive (P = 0.029), and with the HCW having no history of such accidents (P = 0.047). Adherence to the recommended serological testing was better at the evaluation scheduled for 3 months after the exposure (the initial evaluation) than at those scheduled for 6 and 12 months after the exposure (P = 0.004). During the study period, there was one confirmed case of HCW seroconversion to HCV positivity. The establishment of a protocol that involves the immediate supervisor of the affected HCWs, in the formal summoning of those HCWs is necessary in order to increase the rate of adherence to post-exposure follow-up.

4910,0.003,3.0,"Patients with human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV)-infection have a high prevalence of abnormal bone metabolism and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D treatment has some benefit in patients with HIV infection. In this paper, we review the evidence for an association between vitamin D and HIV infection. Literature search was done from Medline. Genetic studies have provided the opportunity to determine which proteins link vitamin D to HIV pathology [i.e., the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, vitamin D receptor, cytochrome P(450), renin-angiotensin system, apoli-poprotein E, liver X receptor, toll-like receptor, poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase-1, natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1, and the Sp1 promoter gene]. Vitamin D also exerts its effect on HIV through nongenomic factors, i.e., ultraviolet radiation exposure, matrix metalloproteinase, heme oxygenase-1, the prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase-2, and oxidative stress. In conclusion, vitamin D may have a beneficial role in HIV. Calcitriol, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 should be tested in HIV-infected population because of its active form of the vitamin D3 metabolite and modulates inflammatory cytokine expression. Further investigation with calcitriol in HIV is needed."
6338,0.003,3.0,"To explore the mechanisms underlying liver-directed autoimmune reactions in acute Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, we followed five subjects who were identified in the early incubation phase (30-70 days before the first elevation of transaminases). We assessed serially cellular (using a T-lymphocyte migration inhibitory factor assay) and humoral (RIA) immunity to LSP (a macromolecular, liver-derived lipoprotein complex) and hepatic lectin (HL), the liver-specific receptor for desialylated glycoproteins, which appears to be a major target antigen for autoreactions in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Anti-LSP and anti-HL autoantibodies were found, at some stage during acute HBV infection, in 4/5 subjects, whereas cellular immunity to the same antigens was detected in only two patients. Sustained production of anti-HL antibodies was noted only in patients showing cellular immunity to this antigen and was apparently secondary to liver damage, whereas anti-LSP antibodies were first detected at the onset of liver injury when there was no evidence of T-cell immunity to the same antigenic complex. One explanation for this apparent dichotomy between cellular and humoral responses to LSP is that a helper T-cell response to the major envelope component of HBV, HBsAg, which precedes by 10-20 days the development of anti-LSP antibodies, promotes a humoral reaction to autoantigens contained in the LSP preparation, coexpressed with HBsAg, on the surface of infected hepatocytes."
7393,0.003,3.0,"The selenium concentration in the serum of 67 patients with HIV infection was measured to determine whether selenium deficiency occurred in the different stages of the disease. In the first stage of the study, patients were divided into four groups: symptom-free subjects, PGL (persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), ARC (AIDS related complex), and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Selenium concentrations were normal in HIV antibody positive symptom-free subjects (1.18 +/- 0.27 mumol/L) and lower than normal in the other three groups (p less than 0.001). There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between selenium levels and values of hemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Selenium deficiency was in no case associated with a lack of zinc in serum (also determined in all patients). In the second stage of the study, 12 patients were treated for a period of two months with low doses of selenium to assess whether such supplementation was able to restore their impaired immunological and hematological functions. The therapy increased serum selenium concentrations (from 0.77 +/- 0.23 to 1.44 +/- 0.41 mumol/L) and symptomatic improvements were noted. However, no changes were observed in the immunological and hematological parameters."
3384,0.003,3.0,"An unusual hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant, assigned provisionally to genotype I, was recently reported, characterized by an anomalous genotyping pattern and putative recombination; however, the natural history of this unusual strain is unknown. This study analyzed longitudinal sera collected over a 9-year period from a patient infected with this variant to investigate the clinical profile and intrahost viral evolution over time. The patient, who had immigrated to Canada in 1998 from Vietnam, was treated with lamivudine in 2000. Approximately 4-5 years following the withdrawal of lamivudine therapy, a genomic ""shift"" occurred coincident with ALT flares and increasing HBV viral load, resulting in numerous stable nucleotide substitutions within the core coding region, suggesting altered immune control that may provide a selective advantage to the virus. Analysis of quasispecies diversity over time demonstrated further this shift, with two sequence clusters associated with time points either prior to or following relapse observed, including increased diversity among quasispecies prior to relapse. In keeping with the complex nature of genotype I strains, majority population genomes had a mean genetic distance from genotype C of 7.6 +/- 0.1%, although large genomic segments lacked significant homology with any HBV genotype. Further study is needed to understand the evolutionary origin and natural history of infection with this unique HBV variant."

1167,0.003,3.0,"The protease gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) clinical isolates found in 15 immigrants (most of African origin) living in Spain was examined. Phylogenetic analyses were performed, taking as reference a panel of 26 HIV protease gene sequences deposited with GenBank. All specimens belonged to four distinct HIV-1 non-B subtypes: C (three cases), F (one), G (nine), and H (two). Five patients harboring subtype G strains were further classified within the IbNg recombinant clade. A high degree of genetic polymorphism at the protease gene was seen in all subtypes. Moreover, changes at positions associated with drug resistance were seen in subtype G viruses carried by patients who had not been exposed to protease inhibitors. Plasma viremia was lower than expected for some samples, according to the clinical features and the CD4+ cell count, suggesting that viral load titers were underestimated by all three commercially available techniques. This work represents the first genetic characterization of subtypes C, F, G, and H in Spain."
2271,0.003,3.0,"HIV infection has now been consistently identified as the major cause of death in young Africans in both urban and rural areas. In Africa, several studies have defined the clinical presentation of HIV disease but there have only been a limited number of autopsy studies. Because of the scarcity of autopsy data and the possibility of differing type and frequency of opportunistic infections between different geographic locations we set out to study consecutive new adult medical admissions to a tertiary referral hospital in Nairobi and perform autopsies on a sample of HIV-1-positive and HIV-1-negative patients who died in the hospital ward. Basic demographic data were collected on all patients admitted to two acute medical wards over an 11-month period. Final outcome and final clinical diagnoses were recorded at discharge or death. An autopsy examination was requested if the patient died in the ward. Autopsy examination was performed in 75 HIV-1-positive (40 men, 35 women) and 47 HIV-1-negative (28 men, 19 women) adults who died in the hospital. This represented 48.4% of all HIV-1-positive deaths and 33.3% of all HIV-1-negative deaths. Tuberculosis (TB) and bacterial and interstitial bronchopneumonia accounted for 96% of the major pathology in patients found to be HIV-1-positive at autopsy. TB was present in half the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients and was disseminated in over 80% of cases. Meningeal involvement was present in 26% of those with disseminated TB. By contrast, TB was much less common in the HIV-1-negative patients at autopsy in whom bacterial bronchopneumonia and malignancies were the most common pathologies. The type pathology found in the HIV-1-positive autopsy patients was not different than that found in other areas in Africa so far studied."
5383,0.003,3.0,"To characterize WHO-defined transmitted HIV drug resistance mutation (TDRM) data from recently HIV-infected African volunteers, we sequenced HIV (pol) and evaluated for TDRM the earliest available specimens from ARV-naive volunteers diagnosed within 1 year of their estimated date of infection at eight research centers in sub-Saharan Africa. TDRMs were detected in 19/408 (5%) volunteers. The prevalence of TDRMs varied by research center, from 5/26 (19%) in Entebbe, 6/78 (8%) in Kigali, 2/49 (4%) in Kilifi, to 3/106 (3%) in Lusaka. One of five volunteers from Cape Town (20%) had TDRMs. Despite small numbers, our data suggest an increase in DRMs by year of infection in Zambia (p = 0.004). The prevalence observed in Entebbe was high across the entire study. ARV history data from 12 (63%) HIV-infected sexual partners were available; 3 reported ARV use prior to transmission. Among four partners with sequence data available, transmission linkage was confirmed and two had the same TDRMs as the newly infected volunteer (both K103N). As ARV therapy continues to increase in availability throughout Africa, monitoring incident virus strains for the presence of TDRMs should be a priority. Early HIV infection cohorts provide an excellent and important platform to monitor the development of TDRMs to inform treatment guidelines, drug choices, and strategies for secondary prevention of TDRM transmission."
582,0.003,3.0,"The current study investigated the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection on the rate of change of antiretroviral drugs after the initiation of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART). The data on 1425 HIV-positive patients with recorded serology for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were retrospectively analysed. The estimated rate of treatment change was slightly higher in the HBsAg-positive group (0.57 per year) compared with the HBsAg-negative group (0.50 per year). Although this difference was insignificant in multivariable modelling, the confidence intervals of the estimates barely included unity. Antiretroviral drug family, calendar period, prior exposure to antiretrovirals and the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were independently associated with the number of drug alterations. A slight impact of co-infection on the frequency of treatment change after the beginning of HAART cannot be excluded. However, the paucity of studies on this issue necessitates the conduct of further research."

6259,0.003,3.0,"A prognostic scoring tool (PST) was created to aid prediction of outcome from HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) using data obtained from 577 episodes of PCP among 540 patients presenting to a specialist HIV treatment centre in London, UK. It used risk factors identifiable at/soon after hospitalization, previously identified as being associated with mortality: repeat episode of PCP, patient's age, haemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)) on admission, presence of medical co-morbidity (Comorb) and of pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (PKS). The derived PST was 25.5+(age in years/10) + 2 (if a repeat episode of PCP) + 3 (if Comorb present) + 4 (if PKS detected) - PaO(2) (kPa) - Hb (g/dL), and produced scores that ranged between 0 and 19. Patients were divided into five groups according to their prognostic score: 0-3.9 = group 1 (0% mortality), 4-7.9 = group 2 (3% mortality), 8-10.9 = group 3 (9% mortality), 11-14.9 = group 4 (29% mortality) and ≥ 15 = group 5 (52% mortality). This PST facilitates rapid identification of patients early in their hospitalization who have mild or severe HIV-associated PCP and who are at high and low risk of in-hospital death from PCP. The PST may aid assessment of severity of illness and in directing treatment strategies, but requires validation in patient cohorts from other health-care institutions."
1527,0.003,3.0,"The latent HIV reservoir is a major impediment to curing HIV infection. The contribution of CD4(+) T cell activation status to the establishment and maintenance of the latent reservoir was investigated by enumerating viral DNA components in a cohort of 12 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) containing raltegravir, an integrase inhibitor. Prior to ART, the levels of total HIV DNA were similar across HLA-DR(+) and HLA-DR(-) (HLA-DR(±)) CD38(±) memory CD4(+) T cell phenotypes; episomal two-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) HIV DNA levels were higher in resting (HLA-DR(-) CD38(-)) cells, and this phenotype exhibited a significantly higher ratio of 2-LTR to integrated HIV DNA (P = 0.002). After 1 year of ART, there were no significant differences across each of the memory phenotypes of any HIV DNA component. The decay dynamics of integrated HIV DNA were slow within each subset, and integrated HIV DNA in the resting HLA-DR(-) CD38(-) subset per mm(3) of peripheral blood exhibited no significant decay (half-life of 25 years). Episomal 2-LTR HIV DNA decayed relative to integrated HIV DNA in resting cells with a half-life of 134 days. Surprisingly, from week 12 on, the decay rates of both total and episomal HIV DNA were lower in activated CD38(+) cells. By weeks 24 and 52, HIV RNA levels in plasma were most significantly correlated with the numbers of resting cells containing integrated HIV DNA. On the other hand, total HIV DNA levels in all subsets were significantly correlated with the numbers of HLA-DR(+) CD38(-) cells containing integrated HIV DNA. These results provide insights into the interrelatedness of cell activation and reservoir maintenance, with implications for the design of therapeutic strategies targeting HIV persistence."
3792,0.003,3.0,"To define the extent of sequence conservation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) in vivo, the first 320 amino acids of RT obtained from 2,236 plasma-derived samples from a well-defined cohort of 1,704 HIV-1-infected individuals (457 drug naïve and 1,247 drug treated) were analyzed and examined in structural terms. In naïve patients, 233 out of these 320 residues (73%) were conserved (<1% variability). The majority of invariant amino acids clustered into defined regions comprising between 5 and 29 consecutive residues. Of the nine longest invariant regions identified, some contained residues and domains critical for enzyme stability and function. In patients treated with RT inhibitors, despite profound drug pressure and the appearance of mutations primarily associated with resistance, 202 amino acids (63%) remained highly conserved and appeared mostly distributed in regions of variable length. This finding suggests that participation of consecutive residues in structural domains is strictly required for cooperative functions and sustainability of HIV-1 RT activity. Besides confirming the conservation of amino acids that are already known to be important for catalytic activity, stability of the heterodimer interface, and/or primer/template binding, the other 62 new invariable residues are now identified and mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This new knowledge could be of help in the structure-based design of novel resistance-evading drugs."

Reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of plasma virions were sequenced from 100 individuals. The majority of the patients were recently diagnosed. Codons 20-255 of the RT and 1-96 of the protease gene were examined for major and minor mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance reported by the International AIDS Society- USA (IAS-USA) Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance was 1%, with only one patient having a Y181C amino acid substitution in the RT gene that confers high-level resistance to nevirapine and delavirdine. Minor mutations were detected in high prevalence in the protease gene. Amino acid substitutions I13V, E35D, and M36I were associated with CRF01_AE while L63P, V77I, and I93L were associated with subtype B. Baseline prevalence of major mutations associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs was low among antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 patients, suggesting that routine drug resistance testing may be unnecessary for all individuals newly diagnosed with HIV or all patients beginning antiretroviral therapy."
1859,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef is a membrane-associated protein decreasing surface expression of CD4, CD28, and major histocompatibility complex class I on infected cells. We report that Nef strongly down-modulates surface expression of the beta-chain of the CD8alphabeta receptor by accelerated endocytosis, while CD8 alpha-chain expression is less affected. By mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of the CD8 beta-chain, an FMK amino acid motif was shown to be critical for Nef-induced endocytosis. Although independent of CD4, endocytosis of the CD8 beta-chain was abrogated by the same mutations in Nef that affect CD4 down-regulation, suggesting common molecular interactions. The ability to down-regulate the human CD8 beta-chain was conserved in HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac239 Nef and required an intact AP-2 complex. The Nef-mediated internalization of receptors, such as CD4, major histocompatibility complex class I, CD28, and CD8alphabeta, may contribute to the subversion of the host immune system and progression towards AIDS."

The urine samples were screened for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae in HIV positive men without urethritis symptoms was significantly higher than that in HIV negative men with urethritis symptoms (p<0.05). HIV positive individuals should be considered as a high-risk group in respect to the other sexually transmitted diseases, thus necessitating screening for N. gonorrhoeae in order to break the infectious chain in these patients."
3234,0.003,3.0,"Although several immunologic and virologic markers measured in peripheral blood are useful for predicting accelerated progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, their validity for evaluating the response to antiretroviral therapy and their ability to accurately reflect changes in lymphoid organs remain unclear. In the present study, changes in certain virologic markers have been analyzed in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue during antiretroviral therapy. Sixteen HIV-infected individuals who were receiving antiretroviral therapy with zidovudine for > or = 6 months were randomly assigned either to continue on zidovudine alone or to add didanosine for 8 weeks. Lymph node biopsies were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Viral burden (i.e., HIV DNA copies per 10(6) mononuclear cells) and virus replication in mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and lymph node and plasma viremia were determined by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. Virologic and immunologic markers remained unchanged in peripheral blood and lymph node of patients who continued on zidovudine alone. In contrast, a decrease in virus replication in lymph nodes was observed in four of six patients who added didanosine to their regimen, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma viremia. These results indicate that decreases in plasma viremia detected during antiretroviral therapy reflect downregulation of virus replication in lymphoid tissue."

HCV transmission patterns have changed among the HIV co-infected population during the last decade, with acute HCV infection emerging worldwide. HIV infection accelerates the progression of HCV-related liver diseases and consequently cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the current standard treatment of HCV infection with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin results in only a limited viral response. Furthermore, cumbersome pill regimens, antiretroviral related hepatotoxicity, and drug interactions of HCV and HIV regimens complicate therapy strategies. Fortunately, in the near future, new direct-acting anti-HCV agents will widen therapeutic options for HCV/HIV co-infection. Liver transplantation is also gradually accepted as a therapeutic option for end stage liver disease of HCV/HIV co-infected patients. "

2909,0.003,3.0,"Cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis-associated complications, is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients in the post-antiretroviral therapy era. HIV alone accelerates atherosclerosis. Antiretroviral therapy; HIV-associated comorbidities, such as dyslipidemia, drug abuse, and opportunistic infections; and lifestyle are risk factors for HIV-associated atherosclerosis. However, our current understanding of HIV-associated atherogenesis is very limited and has largely been obtained from clinical observation. There is a pressing need to experimentally unravel the missing link between HIV and atherosclerosis. Understanding these mechanisms will help to better develop and design novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of HIV-associated cardiovascular disease. HIV mainly infects T cells and macrophages resulting in the induction of oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, the formation of the inflammasome, and the dysregulation of autophagy. These mechanisms may contribute to HIV-associated atherogenesis. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding and propose potential mechanisms of HIV-associated atherosclerosis."
9861,0.003,3.0,"The use of antiretroviral (ARV) medications has been linked to the emergence of severe adverse effects, including mitochondrial toxicity. The liver also appears to be among the affected organs. Nevertheless, different studies suggest that these patients' mitochondrial alterations could be associated to other etiological factors. The goal of this study was to analyze hepatic mitochondria ultrastructural changes in HIV-infected patients under investigation for hepatopathy. Semiquantitative analysis of mitochondria was performed in liver biopsies from 10 patients divided into 2 groups: Group 1 consisted of 5 patients who had never used ARV medications; group 2 consisted of 5 patients who reported previous use of either zidovudine or didanosine. Significant mitochondrial alterations were found in both groups. The summation of the mitochondrial alterations was higher in group 1 (P < .05) when compared with those who had previously used ARV medications. Therefore, the authors conclude that severe mitochondrial alterations occur in HIV-infected patients who have never been submitted to antiretroviral therapy."
5531,0.003,3.0,"Effective antiretroviral therapy initially resulted in large decreases in hospitalization rates of HIV-infected patients. The goal of this study was to determine whether these gains were being maintained in 2001. A cross-sectional study of hospital admission characteristics during four time periods was performed. All patients receiving care at the HIV clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (NYPH) in New York City were included. In 1995, 883 outpatients were receiving care for HIV infection at NYPH; this increased to 1990 outpatients by 2001. Demographic and laboratory information was obtained for these outpatients, and diagnoses were recorded for all patients requiring hospitalization on at NYPH during the time periods January 1 through June 30, in 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001. The incidence of hospital admission declined in all four time periods: 1995 (95 per 100 patient-years [pt-yr]), 1997 (48 per 100 pt-yr), 1999 (38 per 100 pt-yr, p < 0.05), and 2001 (25 per 100 pt-yr). The incidence of bacterial pneumonia and opportunistic infections (OIs) decreased in all four time periods. The median hospitalization were CD4(+) cell count for outpatients increased from 231 (1995) to 364 (2001). Important predictors of hospitalization were CD4(+) < 200, and IVDU as an HIV risk factor. Since 1995 and the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, continuing increases in CD4(+) cell counts of outpatients has been reflected in persistent declines in hospitalization rates. Large decreases in OIs and pneumonia have been minimally offset by stable rates of hospital admissions for diagnoses such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and cellulitis."
8788,0.003,3.0,"Hepatic iron overload has been described in chronic hepatitis C as a cofactor affecting fibrosis progression. Data in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection are scarce. We investigated hepatic iron deposits and serum iron indices in 205 consecutive patients with hepatitis B and compensated liver disease. Mean age of the patients was 42.4 ± 12.4 years and 72.5% were males. Coinfection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) was present in 8.8%. At least one of the serum iron indices was elevated in 41.5% of cases. Hepatic iron deposits were detected in 35.1% of patients, most of them being minimal (grade I) (59.7%) or mild (grade II) (27.8%). Variables significantly associated with hepatic iron deposits were male gender (P = 0.001), serum ferritin (P = 0.008), γGT (P = 0.05) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.05) levels. By multivariate analysis hepatic iron deposits correlated with serum ferritin [odds ratio (OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.4, P = 0.002]. Presence of mild-moderate (grades II and III) hepatic iron deposits could be excluded with high negative predictive value (90%) when serum ferritin was within normal values. A significant correlation between coinfection with HDV and hepatic iron deposits was also found (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.52-11.82, P = 0.003). When compared to monoinfected cases, HDV positive patients had more elevated γGT (P = 0.03), more advanced fibrosis and more severe iron deposits (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in well-compensated chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatic iron deposits and elevation of serum iron indices are common, especially in male gender and in patients coinfected with HDV. As HBV/HDV liver disease is generally more rapidly progressive than that caused by HBV monoinfection, we speculate that iron overload may be one of the factors contributing to the severity of liver disease."
1443,0.003,3.0,"A patient with hematologic malignancy and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection received chemotherapy containing a glucocorticoid. The patient developed severe hepatitis after chemotherapy and, despite achieving complete remission of the malignancy, died of hepatic failure. We carried out a retrospective study of changes in the serological markers of HBV in this patient. Both serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) were negative on admission. During the course of chemotherapy, HBsAg gradually became positive, but no liver dysfunction was apparent until after completion of the chemotherapy. The patient showed no initial evidence of being a latent HBV carrier. Therefore, we believe that screening for HBsAg is insufficient for detecting latent HBV carriers, and that investigation for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) is essential."
7433,0.003,3.0,"The role of exposure to antiretrovirals (ARV) and serum matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) on liver fibrosis (LF) progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mono or HIV- hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection is unclear. Thus, 213 Caucasian adult HIV-infected patients were studied, 111 of whom had HCV-coinfection and 68 were HCV-monoinfected. Patients with ethanol consumption >50 g/day, hepatitis B coinfection, non-infective liver diseases or HAART adherence <75% were excluded. LF was assessed by transient elastometry (TE, Fibroscan). Serum levels of MMPs (MMP -1,-2,-3,-8,-9,-10 and -13) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP-1,-2 and -4) were measured by ELISA microarrays. Associations with LF were statistically analysed. Protease inhibitors, usually administered to patients with advanced LF were excluded from the analysis. Increased LF was significantly associated with d4T (P = 0.006) and didanosine (ddI) use (P = 0.007), months on d4T (P = 0.001) and on ARV (P = 0.025), duration of HIV (P < 0.0001) and HCV infections (P < 0.0001), higher HIV (P = 0.03) and HCV loads (P < 0.0001), presence of lipodystrophy (P = 0.02), male gender (P = 0.02), older age (P = 0.04), low nadir (P = 0.02) and current CD4(+) T-cells (P < 0.0001), low gain of CD4(+) T-cells after HAART (P = 0.01) and higher MMP-2 (P = 0.02) and TIMP-2 serum levels (P = 0.02). By logistic regression the only variables significantly associated with increased LF were: use of ddI (OR 8.77, 95% CI: 2.36-32.26; P = 0.005), male gender (OR 7.75, 95% CI: 2.33-25.64, P = 0.0008), HCV viral load (in log) (OR 3.53, 95% CI: 2.16-5.77; P < 0.0001) and age (in years) (OR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34, P = 0.0003). We conclude that only higher HCV viral load, older age, male gender, and use of ddI associated independently with increased LF in our study."
7362,0.003,3.0,"Providers are central to effective implementation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Primary care providers (PCP) and infectious disease physicians (ID) in the US Air Force (USAF) participated in a cross-sectional survey regarding knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward HIV PrEP. Characteristics associated with PrEP knowledge were assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses.Among 403 (40% of 1015 providers) participants, 9% (PCP 383, ID 20) ever prescribed PrEP. In univariate analysis, years in practice, number of HIV-infected patients treated in the past 12 months, past prescription of antiretrovirals for HIV prevention, frequency of prescribing PrEP in the past 12 months, and ever being questioned by a patient about PrEP were associated with PrEP knowledge (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, providers who had ever prescribed antiretrovirals to prevent HIV (AOR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.27-4.42) had greater odds of high PrEP knowledge. Despite concerns about medication side effects (overall 67%: PCP 68%, ID 85%) and prescribing PrEP without clear evidence (overall 60%: PCP 65%, ID 62%), 64% (PCP 65%, ID 85%) of participants indicated PrEP should be offered in the Military Health System and 68% (PCP 70%, ID 100%) disagreed with the statement that their patient population was not at risk for HIV infection.Successful PrEP implementation in the USAF will require continued education and training of primary care providers to improve knowledge and mitigate concerns about PrEP.

7094,0.003,3.0,"Our study assessed the influence of HIV-related stigma on treatment adherence among people living with HIV in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and whether social support had a moderating effect on this relationship. We recruited 128 patients living with HIV from Sansai Hospital, a community hospital in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and collected data through structured interviews. All forms of HIV-related stigma considered in this study (personalized experience, disclosure, negative self-image, and public attitudes) were negatively correlated with adherence to anti-retroviral regimens. Multiple linear regression indicated that total HIV-related stigma was more predictive of treatment adherence than any individual stigma type, after adjusting for socio-demographic and health characteristics. Tests of interaction showed that social support did not appear to moderate the association between HIV stigma and treatment adherence. Our findings suggest that community and government efforts to improve public perceptions about people living with HIV might promote treatment adherence behaviors among HIV-positive patients. "
6686,0.003,3.0,"A prospective design was used to collect data from 132 HIV-positive individuals presenting for mental health care at an inner-city HIV-related mental health clinic located in a large metropolitan area of the Southeastern USA. Data were analyzed to assess associations between study variables and whether participants returned for care following an initial mental health assessment. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which the addition of measures of health beliefs and HIV-related stigma would enhance the predictive capacity of a dropout model that included demographics and health status measures. As health beliefs and HIV-related stigma were added to the model, the predictive capacity increased significantly (R(2)=0.29 to R(2)=0.63, p<0.05). Those who did not return for care had higher levels of perceived barriers to mental health care, higher levels of HIV-related stigma, were more likely to be of non-white ethnicity and had lower T-cell counts. These findings indicate that mental health providers may need to ensure care systems are responsive to the social and cultural characteristics of clients, and the HIV epidemic itself, in order to effectively engage clients into care."
380,0.003,3.0,"The objective of the study was to investigate whether closer adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with metabolic aspects of the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-induced metabolic syndrome (fat redistribution [FR], insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) in HIV-positive patients. This was a cross-sectional study. Two hundred twenty-seven HIV-infected patients were evaluated during a single outpatient visit to the General Clinical Research Center of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Usual dietary intake and physical activity habits were evaluated; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MedDietScore) was calculated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, computed tomographic findings, anthropometrics, and data from the study interviews and questionnaires were used for the assessment of body composition using specific criteria. A complete metabolic profile was available for all subjects. In the entire study sample, a weak inverse association was found between insulin resistance, estimated using the homeostasis model assessment, and MedDietScore (standardized beta = -0.15, P = .03). Interaction models revealed that this was largely driven by an inverse association in patients with FR (standardized beta = -0.13, P = .02). Moreover, MedDietScore was positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (standardized beta = 0.15, P = .01) and marginally negatively associated with circulating triglyceride levels (standardized beta = -0.16, P = .13) in this group of patients. Adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern was favorably related to cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-positive patients with FR. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm our data in different populations and to explore the underlying mechanisms."
9599,0.003,3.0,"Viral hepatitis which follows transfusions (post-transfusion hepatitis) may be due to those transfusions, i.e., transfusion-transmitted hepatitis (TTH), or may be incident to the reason for the transfusion and, thus, may be transfusion-associated, but not transfusion-transmitted. The current risks of TTH, today, are extremely small, but are still due, primarily, to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the latter, formerly being known as ""non-A, non-B hepatitis."" The residual, now, of TTH which is non-A, non-B, and non-C is extremely small and may be due to a variety of agents. Using volunteer (unpaid), repeat, blood donors, who are carefully screened for hepatitis risk factors and then tested for evidence of HBV infection, the risk of HBV being transmitted by a transfusion today is in the order of 1 per 63,000 units of blood. For transfusion-transmitted HCV, with the same repeat, volunteer (unpaid) donors, careful screening and a sensitive assay for anti-HCV, the risk is in the order of 1 in 125,000 units. These risks of HBV and HCV due to transfusions are so small that other means of acquiring these viruses should be sought when patients develop hepatitis following blood transfusions. However, efforts to further reduce the current risks of HBV and HCV transmission by transfusions should continue; these include restricting transfusions to those which are necessary or appropriate, utilizing alternatives to transfusion, employing novel assays to detect viral nucleic acids, and, finally, implementing various microbial inactivation techniques on blood, blood components and plasma derivatives."
9160,0.003,3.0,"To detect the beliefs concerning the risk levels related to several sexual practices/habits and the HIV infection among undergraduate students and to compare their opinion with the AIDS experts were the objectives of this study. A 25-item questionnaire (Likert Probability Scale) about sexual practices/habits were answered by undergraduate students enrolled in the courses of nursing, medical school, pharmacy-biochemistry, psychology. Based on Factorial analysis and by using the Varimax Rotation System, 25 patients were distributed in 7 factors, and 5 patients were excluded. From the 20 patients, 5 were reunited in 2 factors and studied in this paper. Factor X reunited the patients 1 (vaginal intercourse with condom) and 2 (anal sex with condom). In factor Y the patients included were: 3 (heterosexual intercourse), 4 (vaginal intercourse without condom) and 5 (anal intercourse without condom). In 80% of the 5 patients, it was observed that the students have knowledge similar to the experts""s evidences But, continuing education is necessary to these people, as human beings and as future health care givers to the HIV infected/AIDS patients."
1450,0.003,3.0,"Several hematological abnormalities associated with HIV have been documented, but the mechanisms responsible for the cytopenias in AIDS patients are complex and not always completely understood. Thrombocytopenia, which occurs in about 40% of patients with HIV infection, may be caused by increased peripheral platelet destruction, a defect in platelet production due to the impaired formation of platelets by HIV-infected magakaryocytes, or a combination of these. The aim of this study was to compare the morphology of the platelet aggregates in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) clots prepared from HIV patients with those of controls without HIV. These platelet aggregates were studied using the scanning electron microscope to determine the effect of the virus on platelet ultrastructure. The results showed that although the platelets do aggregate, the morphology was changed with membrane blebbing as well as torn cellular membranes. Membrane blebbing is typically associated with apoptosis. It is concluded that the altered morphology of platelet aggregates in HIV patients may be related to thrombocytopenia as a result of peripheral platelet destruction."

7848,0.003,3.0,"This demonstration study tested the impact of a 5-month clinic-wide social marketing campaign at improving adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The intervention included a video, posters, pens, mugs, and lapel buttons with the campaign slogan ""Live the Solution: Take Your Pills Every Day."" Participants self-reported adherence over a 4-week interval, the primary outcome, with a visual analogue scale. Pre- and post-intervention surveys were completed by 141 participants. Adherence did not change over time (absolute mean change -2.02 %, paired t test P = 0.39). Among the 39.7 % of participants who correctly identified the campaign slogan on the post-intervention survey, adherence increased by 3.3 %, while it decreased in the other participants by 5.5 % (paired t test P = 0.07). The well-received campaign did not increase short-term adherence to ART, but adherence tended to increase in participants who were more engaged with the intervention. Future interventions should engage patients more completely and have a more potent effect on adherence."
3140,0.003,3.0,"The increasing demand for fertility advice among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women under our care led us to review the incidence of infertility and the ethical problems associated with its management. All HIV-positive women who attended the HIV outpatients clinic from October 1990 to the end of January 1996 were studied. The main outcome measures were: the number of women undergoing infertility investigations before and after HIV diagnosis, their demographic and social details, and the outcome of these investigations. Most of the 183 women studied were in their reproductive years (mean age 32.7 +/- 6.7 years). Nine women had undergone infertility investigations, and/or treatment before HIV diagnosis, three of whom were diagnosed with HIV during routine testing prior to IVF treatment. Six declined further infertility treatment after discovering their HIV status. Eight women have undergone infertility investigations after HIV diagnosis but none have achieved pregnancy to date. Management decisions may have been hampered by ethical uncertainties in several cases. In conclusion therefore, as requests for infertility treatment from HIV-infected women occur and may become more common as the prevalence of HIV infection in women continues to rise, the ethical issues associated with the management of this problem demand urgent attention so that clear guidelines are available to aid treatment decisions."

2656,0.003,3.0,"Postmortem cesarean sections are rare events, but modern technology is forcing society to explore the definition of viability and the legal rights of both mother and fetus that ultimately will affect the frequency and use of this rare operation. Since the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prevalence rate and the number of critically ill obstetrical patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) continues to rise, it is reasonable to assume more patients and physicians may be confronted by issues concerning fetal and maternal rights and other considerations in perimortem delivery. A 33-year-old woman, at 27 weeks' gestation, with fulminant AIDS was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in respiratory distress. As her condition deteriorated the complex problem of caring for both mother and fetus emerged. A patient advisory panel explored the issues with the patient, her family, and her health care team. Eventually a peri/postmortem cesarean section was performed on the mother when she suffered an acute fatal cardiorespiratory arrest. With the prevalence of AIDS increasing and with most women not being tested prior to pregnancy, many obstetricians will be confronted with new medical and legal challenges. Establishing comprehensive medical management for the critically ill obstetrical patient and understanding the legal rights of both patients (mother and fetus) will help avoid conflicts and potentially improve survival."
2301,0.003,3.0,"Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can be successfully treated using nucleos(t)ide analogs (NA), but drug-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants frequently arise, leading to treatment failure and progression to liver disease. There has been much research into the mechanisms of resistance to NA and selection of these mutants. Five NA have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of CHB; it is unlikely that any more NA will be developed in the near future, so it is important to better understand mechanisms of cross-resistance (when a mutation that mediates resistance to one NA also confers resistance to another) and design more effective therapeutic strategies for these 5 agents. The genes that encode the polymerase and envelope proteins of HBV overlap, so resistance mutations in polymerase usually affect the hepatitis B surface antigen; these alterations affect infectivity, vaccine efficacy, pathogenesis of liver disease, and transmission throughout the population. Associations between HBV genotype and resistance phenotype have allowed cross-resistance profiles to be determined for many commonly detected mutants, so genotyping assays can be used to adapt therapy. Patients that experience virologic breakthrough or partial response to their primary therapy can often be successfully treated with a second NA, if this drug is given at early stages of these events. However, best strategies for preventing NA resistance include first-line use of the most potent antivirals with a high barrier to resistance. It is important to continue basic research into HBV replication and pathogenic mechanisms to identify new therapeutic targets, develop novel antiviral agents, design combination therapies that prevent drug resistance, and decrease the incidence of complications of CHB."
6921,0.003,3.0,"Because pancreatitis has been reported frequently in adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection, we sought to determine the incidence of pancreatitis in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome by reviewing all records of children with AIDS, their serum amylase and lipase levels, and the factors associated with pancreatitis through a case-control analysis. During a 6-year period pancreatitis developed in 9 (17%) of 53 pediatric patients with AIDS. Six children had vertical transmission of infection and three patients had acquired HIV infection through contaminated blood products. Pancreatitis developed at a median age of 5.2 years (range 1.2 to 20 years). All patients had vomiting and abdominal pain. When the patients were first seen, lipase values were elevated more than amylase values (p = 0.028). Amylase and lipase levels declined at comparable rates. In the case-control analysis, pentamidine isethionate was significantly associated with pancreatitis (p = 0.02); the risk was greater in patients who received pentamidine isethionate and had absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm3 (p = 0.001). Infections associated with the onset of pancreatitis included cytomegalovirus (4), Cryptosporidium (1), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (3), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (1). Coinfection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a protracted course in four children. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated biliary ductal dilatation 6 months after the onset of pancreatitis in one child. Seven children have died at a mean of 8 months after the initial onset of pancreatitis; the one living child has survived 5 months from the onset of pancreatitis. We conclude that pancreatitis is common in pediatric patients with AIDS and may be related to pentamidine isethionate exposure, especially when absolute CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are less than 100 cells/mm3. Serum amylase levels do not always accurately predict the onset of pancreatitis; serum lipase levels should be measured in children with symptoms. The onset of pancreatitis in an HIV-infected child is a poor prognostic indicator."
6602,0.003,3.0,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have reached epidemic proportions in many developing and developed nations, leading to talk of the ""twin epidemics."" The latest projections from the International Diabetes Federation suggest that 190 million people worldwide currently have type 2 diabetes. In addition, > or = 300 million people worldwide have impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). These statistics represent an epidemic of major proportions--possibly the largest epidemic in human history--in terms of glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk because individuals with IGT are at substantially higher risk for diabetes and CVD than are members of the general population. Along with IGT, the metabolic syndrome comprises other major CVD risk factors, including insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia; insulin resistance has been implicated as the single most common cause of the syndrome. Although the exact prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is unknown, the syndrome is widespread among adults in developed nations, becoming more prevalent with age. Epidemiologic data suggest that in patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, both diabetes and obesity are 1.5 to 2.0 times more prevalent than in the general population. Furthermore, because adverse effects of certain therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and psychiatric disorders increase the risk for developing diabetes, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome, such therapies should be carefully chosen, particularly considering CVD risk. Appropriate therapy may be determined via screening of patients for levels of fasting blood glucose and lipids, as well as other CVD risk factors, before initiating use of second-generation antipsychotic agents or highly active antiretroviral therapy."
3352,0.003,3.0,"Psychosocial conditions such as depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) have been associated with poor HIV-related outcomes. In India, which has the third largest HIV epidemic in the world, little is understood about the impact of psychosocial conditions on people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to understand the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial conditions among PLHIV entering into HIV care at the Y.R. Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education in Chennai, India. Thirteen questions were added to the standard voluntary counseling and testing questionnaire, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (a depression scale) and questions assessing for CSA and IPV. We fitted logistic regression models, stratified by gender, with psychosocial condition as the outcome of interest and substance use variables and socio-demographic variables as the correlates of interest. Three hundred and eighty-three persons were enrolled into the study; of these, 253 (66%) tested positive for HIV, including 149 men and 104 women, and were included in the models. More than one-quarter (28%) of the men and 19% of the women reported at least one psychosocial condition (probable depression, CSA, or IPV). In adjusted analysis, current alcohol use was associated with greater than two times higher odds of a psychosocial condition (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 2.24, 95% CI, 1.04-4.85) among men. In conclusion, we estimated the prevalence of probable depression, CSA, and IPV among PLHIV presenting for HIV care in southern India and found that, among male PLHIV, alcohol use was associated with a markedly higher odds of reporting a psychosocial condition. Further study is needed to characterize alcohol use among male PLHIV and the possible deleterious impact of psychosocial conditions and alcohol use on HIV-related outcomes in India."
7069,0.003,3.0,"Late presentation remains a major concern despite the dramatically improved prognosis realized by ART. We define a first presentation for HIV care during the course of HIV infection as 'late' if an AIDS-defining opportunistic disease is apparent, or if CD4+ T-cells are <200/microl. In the Western world, approximately 10 and 30% of HIV-infected individuals still present with CD4+ T-cells <50 and <200/microl, respectively; estimates are substantially higher for developing countries. Diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic diseases and intense supportive in-hospital care take precedence over ART. Benefits of starting ART without delay, that is, when opportunistic diseases are still active, include faster resolution of opportunistic diseases and a decreased risk of recurrence. The downside of starting ART without delay could include toxicity, drug interactions and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Among asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals presenting late, where ART and primary prophylaxis are initiated, approximately 10-20% will become symptomatic from drug toxicity or undiagnosed opportunistic complications, including IRIS, which require appropriate therapies. In this review we describe late presentation to HIV care, the scale of the problem, the evaluation of a late-presenting patient and challenges associated with initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the setting of acute opportunistic infections and other comorbidities."
6221,0.003,3.0,The ultrasensitive COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor test was complemented with automated RNA purification on the MagNA Pure LC instrument. This enabled entirely automated ultrasensitive assessment of viral loads in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. The detection limit of the fully automated assay and the viral load measurements in 80 clinical samples were found to be in good agreement with those of the conventional ultrasensitive COBAS AMPLICOR HIV-1 Monitor test. The fully automated assay showed markedly reduced hands-on time and was found to be suitable for the routine assessment of HIV-1 viral loads in a clinical diagnostic laboratory.
5080,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment updates include screening recommendations, fourth-generation testing, preexposure prophylaxis, and a paradigm shift; treatment is prevention. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends routine HIV screening in persons 15 to 65 years of age, regardless of risk. Fourth-generation testing is replacing the Western blot and can identify those with acute HIV infection. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test; however, there are concerns about reduced sensitivity, possible misinterpretation of results, potential for less effective counseling, and possible cost barriers. Preexposure prophylaxis (effective in select high-risk adult populations) is the combination of safer sex practices and continuous primary care prevention services, plus combination antiretroviral therapy. Concerns for preexposure prophylaxis include the necessity of strict medication adherence, limited use among high-risk populations, and community misconceptions of appropriate use. Evidence supports combination antiretroviral therapy as prevention for acute HIV infection, thus lowering community viral loads. Evidence has increased supporting combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment at any CD4 cell count. Resistance testing should guide therapy in all patients on entry into care. Within two weeks of diagnosis of most opportunistic infections, combination antiretroviral therapy should be started; patients with tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis require special considerations."
6413,0.003,3.0,"A methodology based on micellar liquid chromatography to monitor five antiretroviral drugs (lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zidovudine and efavirenz) was proposed. Antiretrovirals were studied in sets of three, corresponding to each highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regime, prescribed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-infected patients. Four aqueous micellar mobile phases buffered at pH 7 were optimized to separate these compounds, using sodium dodecyl sulfate as the tensioactive, and 1-propanol or 1-pentanol as the organic modifier. The composition of each mobile phase was optimized for each antiretroviral. The common separation conditions were: C18 apolar column (125 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size), UV detection set at 214 nm, and mobile phase running at 1 mL min(-1) without controlling the temperature. The finally suggested method was validated for five analysed antiretroviral drugs following the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines in terms of: linearity between 0.5 and 50 ppm (r(2) > 0.9995), sensitivity (LOD lower than 0.25 ppm), intra- and inter-day precision (<7.1 and <5.2%, respectively) and accuracy (recovery 88.5-105.3% and 93.5-101.3%, respectively), as well as robustness (<6.5%). The proposed method was used to monitor the level of antiretrovirals in the serum of AIDS patients. The suggested methodology was found to be useful in the routine analysis of antiretrovirals in serum samples."
1851,0.003,3.0,"There are very few data on the molecular biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in dialysis patients. 101 patients undergoing dialysis treatment in 4 units in the Lombardy, northern Italy, were analyzed by RT-PCR for HCV viremia, by line probe assay technology for HCV genotyping and by a serological analysis for detecting type-specific antibodies. 61 of 101 (60%) patients showed detectable HCV RNA in serum; HCV genotype 2a was dominant (30/53 = 57%), followed by HCV genotype 1b (20/53 = 37%). There was no relationship between HCV genotyping and the clinical or demographic features of the patients. The antibody response toward the c33-c, c100-3, and 5-1-1 antigens was more frequent in HCV genotype 1b compared with genotype 2a (p = 0.046, p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively). The antibody levels to NS-3 and NS-4 HCV proteins were significantly higher in patients with-HCV genotype 1b in comparison with HCV 2a-infected individuals (p = 0.0001). There was a high level (82%) of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the assessment of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis; further, it was possible to detect type-specific antibodies in 6 of 22 (27%) patients in whom PCR amplification was unsuccessful. In conclusion, HCV subtype 2a was dominant in our population of HCV-infected dialysis patients, dialysis patients infected by different genotypes showed similar demographic and clinical characteristics, the antibody response toward the NS-3- and NS-4-related antigen of HCV was genotype dependent. There was a high level of agreement between HCV genotyping by RT-PCR and the detection of type-specific antibodies by serological analysis. As significant biological differences may exist among HCV strains, the assessment of HCV types may be very useful in the routine clinical activity of nephrologists in dialysis units."

7332,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) remain among the most common disorders in people infected with HIV, even in an era when potent antiretroviral therapy is widely deployed. This review discusses the clinical features of HANDs and the implications for more effective treatment. With the improved survival of individuals treated with antiretrovirals, comorbid conditions are increasingly salient, including particularly coinfection with hepatitis C and the effects of aging. This review attempts to answer why there appears to be a therapeutic gap between the salutary effects of antiretroviral regimens and normalization of neurological function. A second gap is found in the understanding of the pathophysiology of HANDs. This review addresses this and discusses the animal models that have helped to elucidate these mechanisms. Although triggered by productive HIV infection of brain macrophages, aberrant and sustained immune activation appears to play a major role in inducing HANDs, and may explain the often incomplete neurological response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Novel therapies aimed at persistent central nervous system inflammation will be needed to close this gap."
5212,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was revealed by a severe acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg in a patient. The positivity of IgM anti-HBc antibody, the rapid negativization of DNA-HBV, the early normalization of liver function tests and the exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis favored the diagnosis of recent HBV infection and were predictive of a rapidly favorable outcome. However, immunohistochemical study of a transjugular hepatic biopsy sample discovered HBsAg within the liver, with a characteristic topographic distribution of chronic HBV infection. The patient's evolution confirmed this diagnosis, because 20 months later he had chronic active hepatitis with persistent replicative activity of HBV. This case illustrates the heterogeneity of HBV infections, emphasizing the need of an accurate diagnosis and a careful follow up until the complete resolution of each case of acute hepatitis with positive HBsAg."
7641,0.003,3.0,"Viral load testing for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in resource-poor settings continues to be a challenge. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being made available in developing countries, monitoring of viral load is not being done on a regular basis. The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of Cavidi version 3.0, which measures the plasma reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and compare its performance with molecular HIV viral load assays. In all, 125 HIV-1 and 13 HIV-2 positive samples were analyzed. The overall sensitivity of the assay was 86.8% and 94.1% for viral load >1000 copies/ml measured by Qiagen Artus HIV-1 RG RT PCR and Abbott RealTime HIV-1 PCR assays, respectively. Compared with the routine molecular viral load assays, Cavidi version 3.0 is inexpensive, user-friendly, the expenditure on infrastructure is minimal, and it can be used for monitoring of both HIV types.

3984,0.003,3.0,Serum from patients which tested positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) were analyzed for the presence of HCV RNA by nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and for anti-HCV antibodies by Recombinant Immunoblot Assay (RIBA II). Total RNA was extracted from whole blood by a new procedure and subjected to reverse transcription of HCV RNA employing primers to the conserved 5' non-coding region of the HCV genome. PCR performed on these samples uncovered several false positive ELISAs. Reciprocal confirmation between PCR and RIBA II results was observed. These results substantiate this variation of the HCV PCR assay as a reliable alternative for routine confirmation of HCV serological tests.
7211,0.003,3.0,"The general methods used for public health surveillance of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are no different from those used for other diseases and infections. However, the methods used must be adapted to the unique epidemiology, wide variation in prevalences, and the very long incubation period of HIV infections. In addition, the severity of AIDS and the extreme social and personal implications of identifying HIV-infected persons make surveillance of AIDS cases and HIV infections much more difficult and place paramount importance on issues such as anonymity and confidentiality. Information on the occurrence of AIDS cases is essential for planning and developing the clinical and laboratory facilities needed for treatment and care of patients with the disease. However, surveillance of AIDS cases is of limited value for assessing the magnitude and future trends of the pandemic because the number of such cases detected, diagnosed, and reported reflect HIV infections that were acquired many years previously. In addition, there are significant problems associated with the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of most AIDS case-reporting systems. Routine HIV surveillance systems are being developed worldwide. Such systems must be adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation; and the sampling methods used in populations where the prevalence of infection is very low must necessarily differ from those where it is moderate to high. Large-scale population serosurveys are very costly, and the results from such surveys may also be of limited accuracy because of serious problems of selection and participation bias. Furthermore, they may become outdated rapidly in areas where a high incidence of HIV infection occurs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7266,0.003,3.0,"The main objectives of this study were to define the occurrence and levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in asymptomatic HBV carriers, cirrhosis patients and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases from The Gambia, and to evaluate the risk for cirrhosis or HCC associated with HBV viremia. We used sensitive real-time quantitative PCR assays to measure HBV DNA in samples from a case-control study consisting of 60 asymptomatic HBV carriers, 53 cirrhotic patients and 129 HCC cases. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risks of cirrhosis and HCC associated with HBV-DNA levels and HBV e antigenemia (HBeAg) detection (a surrogate marker for viral replication). Detectable HBV viremia and HBeAg positivity were both significantly associated with cirrhosis (increasing risk by fourfold and 11-fold respectively) and with HCC (increasing risk by sixfold and threefold respectively). HBV-DNA levels were significantly higher in both HCC cases and cirrhotic patients compared to asymptomatic carriers (P < 0.01 for both). High-level HBV DNA (>10,000 copies/mL) was strongly associated with both HCC and cirrhosis (17- and 39-fold increased risk). Lower level HBV viremia (200-10,000 copies/mL) conferred a significant risk of HCC, although the association with cirrhosis was not significant. In conclusion, we find that high HBV-DNA levels are strongly associated with the serious sequelae of HBV infection, independent of HBeAg status. While risk for cirrhosis and for HCC notably increases at HBV-DNA levels >or=10,000 copies/mL, low-level viremia was also associated with significant risk for HCC."
7821,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence and de novo HBV infection are frequent events in liver transplantation recipients. Treatment with lamivudine is initially efficient in both infections but the incidence of lamivudine-resistant HBV emergence increases over time. Adefovir appears to be promising in post-liver transplantation patients with recurrent HBV infection and lamivudine-resistant HBV. This study analyzed adefovir treatment in 42 post-liver transplantation patients who developed recurrent HBV or de novo HBV infection with lamivudine-resistant HBV (54.8% HCV-coinfected). Patients received 10 mg of oral adefovir once daily for a mean period of time of 21.5 months (range from 12 to 31 months). In 62.9% of patients, ALT levels decreased significantly. Serum HBV-DNA was undetectable in 64% of the cases. Twenty percent of patients lost HBeAg marker and 13.3% of them developed anti-HBe. In 9.5% of recipients, HBsAg became negative. There was no significant change in serum creatinine levels. In only one patient was worsening of the renal function detected, making dose adjustment necessary. No other side effects were reported. Our results confirm the efficacy and safety of adefovir treatment in post-liver transplantation patients with lamivudine-resistant HBV, neither were adefovir-resistant mutations identified in patients after 21 months of therapy, nor were there adverse events, especially renal toxicity."
6974,0.003,3.0,"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis receive multiple blood transfusions and, thus, are susceptible to infections transmitted through blood and blood products, including infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine the prevalence of antibody to HIV among patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis in Baltimore and Boston in 1985, we conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study. Repeatedly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot analysis. Among 435 patients in Baltimore, 12 (2.8%) were seropositive by both ELISA and Western blot techniques. Among 90 patients in Boston, three (3.3%) were seropositive. Among 100 frozen serum samples obtained from another Boston hemodialysis population in 1980, only one was seropositive. Many repeatedly ELISA-positive specimens were observed in each of the three groups studied, especially the serum samples that had been stored at -30 degrees C to -70 degrees C for four years. Most were nonspecifically reactive as demonstrated by reactivity with an H9-control ELISA plate. Patients undergoing hemodialysis, many of whom have received frequent transfusions in the past, are at increased risk for prior infection with HIV. Serologic testing for either screening or case-finding purposes must be conducted with great attention to specificity; serum samples frozen for prolonged periods are especially likely to be nonspecifically ELISA positive. These findings have implications concerning case-finding purposes, dialysis procedures, renal transplantation, and seroepidemiologic research."

We conducted a prospective observational study of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected immigrants who visited the Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, during June 2010-May 2011. Screening of the most prevalent tropical diseases (intestinal parasitosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) was performed according to geographic origin. A total of 190 patients were included: 141 (74.2%) from Latin America, 41 (21.6%) from sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 (4.2%) from northern Africa. Overall, 36.8% (70 of 190) of the patients had at least one positive result for any parasitic disease: 5 patients with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology, 11 patients with positive Schistosoma mansoni serology, 35 patients with positive Strongyloides stercoralis serology, 7 patients with positive Leishmania infantum serology, intestinal parasitosis were detected in 37 patients, malaria was diagnosed in one symptomatic patient. We propose a screening and management strategy of latent parasitic infections in immigrant patients infected with HIV."
8461,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B is widespread and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality due to the evolution to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This study was designed to improve the national laboratory surveillance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, focusing on genomic analysis of isolates from Romanian patients. Sera from ten patients with HBV were collected and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on a DNA fragment spanning almost the entire genome. The occurrence of mutations was assessed for each open reading frame in the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonging to genotype A (subgenotype A2) and other five clustering with genotype D strains (subgenotype D1). Two patients treated with lamivudine were found to carry isolates harboring rtM204V lamivudine resistance mutation. An HBV isolate displaying a lamivudine complex resistance pattern, rtM204I in conjunction with rtL180M and rtA200V, was found in a lamivudine naïve patient. All samples harbored sA105P substitution, usually found in HBIg therapy escape isolates. Three of the studied strains were simultaneously displaying T1753, T1762 and A1764 mutations which in vitro induce enhanced genome replication and reduction of HBeAg expression. The sequence obtained from a patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis presents a novel type of insertion consisting of nine nucleotides between positions 260 and 261 in the X gene. Despite the small number of samples, our findings suggest the need to determine the drug resistance pattern for each patient before taking a therapeutic decision and also highlight the necessity of knowing the real level of drug resistance among HBV strains circulating in Romania."

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of liver cirrhosis, its main causes and clinical presentation in HIV+ patients. Observational, cross-sectional, retrospective study of all HIV+ individuals followed at one reference HIV outpatient clinic in Madrid. Liver fibrosis was measured in all cases using transient elastometry (FibroScan). All 2168 HIV+ patients on regular follow-up (76% males, 46% injecting drug users) were successfully examined by FibroScan) between October 2004 and August 2006. Liver cirrhosis was recognized in 181 (overall prevalence, 8.3%), and the main aetiologies were HCV, 82.3%; HBV, 1.6%; dual HBV/HCV, 2.8%; and triple HBV/HCV/ hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection, 6.6%. The prevalence of cirrhosis differed among patients with distinct chronic viral hepatitis: HCV, 19.2%; HBV, 6.1%; HBV/HCV, 41.7%; and HBV/HCV/HDV, 66.7%. In 12 patients with cirrhosis (6.7%), no definite aetiology was recognized. Overall, cirrhotics had lower mean CD4 counts than noncirrhotics (408 vs 528 cells/microL respectively; P = 0.02), despite similar proportion of subjects with undetectable viraemia on highly active antiretroviral therapy. Clinical manifestations of liver cirrhosis were: splenomegaly, 61.5%; oesophageal varices, 59.8%; ascites, 22.6%; encephalopathy, 12.1%; and variceal bleeding, 6.1%. Liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation events are relatively frequent in HIV+ individuals. Chronic HCV and alcohol abuse, but not chronic HBV, play a major role. Transient elastometry may allow the identification of a significant number of HIV+ individuals with asymptomatic liver cirrhosis."
2564,0.003,3.0,"The use of gallium scanning in the treatment of patients with AIDS has been well described. In this study, 27 HIV-infected patients (Walter Reed Staging Classification I-V) with normal chest roentgenograms were evaluated to determine the occurrence of thoracic gallium abnormalities in early HIV infection. SPECT was used for gallium scanning. Patients received gallium injection on day 1 and bronchoalveolar lavage on day 2, and scanning was performed on day 3. Twenty-eight scans in 27 patients were performed. Mean nodal SPECT activity was compared with corresponding values for lung parenchyma, bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts, and peripheral blood T4 lymphocyte counts. No relationship between nodal and parenchymal activity and cell counts was observed. Although visual scan interpretation was unaffected, gallium activity was significantly increased in the region of bronchoalveolar lavage compared with uptake in other lung regions. It is concluded that SPECT gallium scanning demonstrates significant gallium avidity in recently lavaged lung areas, although no impact on visual scan interpretation was seen. Further, no correlation was seen between the degree of nodal uptake and the immunologic status of these patients with early HIV infection."
2388,0.003,3.0,"Despite the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) continues to cause a major impact worldwide. HIV-induced lung disease continues to represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality, although the spectrum of pulmonary diseases has changed. HIV significantly affects the lung, causing acute and chronic cellular changes in the alveolar space. The impact of ART on lung immunology still needs to be fully elucidated. Similar to the periphery, ART affects HIV viral load and reconstitutes CD4(+) T cells in the lung. ART has been associated with significant decreases in bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytes and increases in B-cell numbers and functionality, resulting in improved immune responses to vaccinations. There are substantial clinical implications of these ART-induced alterations, including the emergence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and the increased incidences of noninfectious lung diseases, such as lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. There continues to be many unanswered questions regarding the effects of ART on lung health and, in particular, the immune system. Growing knowledge in this area will hopefully diminish the incidence of these noninfectious lung diseases and further improve the health of individuals living with HIV. "
7176,0.003,3.0,"Polymerized human serum albumin virus receptors (pHSA-R) HBsAg, HBeAg, antiHBc-IgM, hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase activity and HBV-DNA were studied in 47 acute hepatitis B patients, divided into three groups: 26 HBeAg(+) initially, with favorable outcome; 4 HBeAg (+), with chronic outcome; and 17 antiHBe (+), with favorable outcome. In the basal sample only 2 and 8 patients in Group I were HBV-DNAp and HBV-DNA positive, respectively, and became negative during the follow-up. In contrast all patients in Group II remained positive to both HBV-markers. After a one-month follow-up 100% of the patients in Group II were positive for pHSA-R and HBeAg, in contrast to 25% among those with a favorable outcome in Group I (p less than 0.005). Meanwhile, only 6 out of 17 patients in Group III remained positive for pHSA-R. A significant decrease in pHSA-R and HBsAg concentrations was observed in patients from Group I (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05, respectively) 15 days after the onset of the disease, while concentrations of both parameters did not vary in Group II. A significant decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations was found in patients from Group III after 15 days (p less than 0.05) and one month follow-up (p less than 0.05), respectively. As a result, pHSA-R and HBeAg are the best prognostic indicators in acute hepatitis B. A decrease in HBsAg and pHSA-R concentrations two weeks after the onset may have predictive value."
7593,0.003,3.0,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occurs in 3-7% of liver transplant recipients (LTR). However, few data exist on the recent epidemiology, predictors and outcomes of CDI in LTR. A cohort study was performed including LTR from 2000 to 2010 at a tertiary care hospital in Detroit. CDI was defined as diarrhea with a stool C. difficile positive test. Data analyzed included demographics, comorbidities, length of stay (LOS), severity of CDI, rates of recurrence (<12 weeks), relapse (<4 weeks) and overall mortality. Predictors of CDI were calculated using Cox proportional hazard model; 970 LTR were followed for years. Overall prevalence of CDI was 18.9%. Incidence of CDI within 1 year of transplant was 12.4%. Severe CDI occurred in 29.1%. CDI recurrence and relapse rates were 16.9% and 9.7%, respectively. Independent predictors of CDI were year of transplant (hazard ratio [HR] 1.137, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.22; p < 0.001), white race (105/162 whites, HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.03-2.1; p = 0.035), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (HR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.045, p = 0.003) and LOS (HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.005-1.02, p < 0.001). Significant mortality was observed among LTR with CDI compared to those without CDI (p = 0.003). We concluded that CDI is common among LTR and is associated with higher mortality. "
4120,0.003,3.0,"CD8+ T lymphocytes of HIV-1 infected individuals produce a soluble factor that efficiently suppresses HIV-1 replication at the transcriptional level. We show here that the response of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) to mitogenic or Tat-mediated activation is sensitive to the suppressive action of a Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS)-transformed CD8+ T cell clone from an HIV-infected individual and supernatants from CD8+ T cells of HIV-1-infected asymptomatic subjects (CD4+ > 350/microliters). Mutagenesis of NF kappa B or Sp-1 elements within the LTR resulted in no change in the ability of CD8+ T cell supernatants to inhibit Tat- or mitogen-mediated LTR transcription. However, the response to HIV-1 Tat by a LTR in which the interleukin (IL)-2 homology NFAT-1 region was mutated resulted in almost complete elimination of suppression by CD8+ T cells. This was not observed when the NFAT-1 mutant LTR was activated by mitogen. We have previously shown that gene expression directed by the HIV-1 NF kappa B elements is inhibited by CD8+ cell-derived supernatants (Copeland et al., AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses, 1995;11:1321-1326). Taken together, these observations suggest that mitogenic activation, mediated primarily through the NF kappa B enhancer, is susceptible to CD8-mediated inhibition, however, inhibition of Tat-mediated activation may rely upon a different pathway that is NFAT-1 dependent."
7231,0.003,3.0,"Recent genome-wide association studies report that the SNP rs8099917, located 8.9 kb upstream of the start codon of IL28B, is associated with both disease chronicity and therapeutic response to pegIFN-α and RBV in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. To determine the effect of rs8099917 variation on the response of HCV to therapy, we genotyped this variant in a cohort of 160 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients in our clinic unit who received combined peg-IFN-α/RBV therapy. The rs8099917 T/G or G/G genotypes were observed in 56 patients (35%). Treatment failure occurred in 80% of G-allele carriers versus 48% of non-carriers (P<0.0001). This result reveals that the G allele was strongly associated with treatment failure in this patient cohort. Importantly, a highly significant association was found between the G-allele and response to therapy in HCV genotype 1-infected patients (P<0.0001) but not in HCV genotype 3-infected patients. Multivariate analysis (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P value) indicated that the rs8099917 TT genotype was a strong predictor of treatment success (5.83; 1.26-26.92; P = 0.021), independent of baseline plasma HCV-RNA load less than 500 000 IU/ml (4.85; 1.18-19.95; P = 0.025) and absence of advanced liver fibrosis (5.24; 1.20-22.91; P = 0.025). These results reveal the high prevalence of the rs8099917 G allele in HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients as well as its strong association with treatment failure in HCV genotype 1-infected patients. rs8099917 SNP genotyping may be a valid pre-treatment predictor of which patients are likely to respond to treatment in this group of difficult-to-treat HCV/HIV-infected patients."

1948,0.003,3.0,Minnesota is currently home to the tenth largest African population and the second largest East African population in the United States. HIV is increasingly being diagnosed in African-born persons in Minnesota. A retrospective survey was conducted on all African-born patients in our HIV clinic between January 1994 and June 2005. We identified 237 patients who were African-born and HIV-positive. They constituted 12% of patients attending the clinic within the study timeframe. There was no significant difference in the ages of the African-born and non-African patients in the HIV clinic. African-born patients were more likely to be women compared with non-African patients (p < 0.001). Forty-three percent of the African-born patients presented with AIDS as defined by CD4(+) T cell counts less than 200 cells per milliliter compared to 33% of antiretroviral naïve non-African HIV patients in the clinic (p < 0.001). Most patients were infected through heterosexual contact and only 4% were diagnosed as a result of routine testing. Seven known HIV subtypes and four unique recombinant forms were identified. The most common opportunistic infection was pulmonary tuberculosis. African immigrants with HIV appear to: (1) access care at later stages of HIV disease than other patients in our clinic; (2) are often infected with non-B subtypes; (3) do not routinely get tested for HIV. Increased awareness to this growing trend is needed for health care providers and public health officials to tailor educational programs and prevention efforts for African immigrants in the United States.

In this report, propagation of PML-type JCV in COS-7-derived cell lines stably expressing HIV-1 Tat (COS-tat cells) has been examined. In COS-tat cells, production of viral particles and replication of genomic DNA were markedly increased compared to COS-7 cells, as judged by HA and real-time PCR analyses. These results demonstrate that COS-tat cells provide a useful model system for studying HIV-1 Tat-mediated propagation of PML-type JCV."
7567,0.003,3.0,"The Tat (trans-activator of transcription) regulatory protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) acts by interacting with the TAR RNA domain of nascent viral transcripts and with cellular proteins to increase viral transcription. In Jurkat-derived HCLE-D36 cells, which are stably transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expressed from the TAR-encoding long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1, CAT protein expression is dependent on Tat. The Tat9-K-biotin peptide antagonist of Tat binds specifically to TAR RNA and competes with Tat for binding. In the cellular expression system, Tat9-K-biotin reduces Tat-dependent CAT expression. However, while the Tat antagonist greatly reduces CAT protein production and polysome association of CAT mRNA, it has little effect on CAT mRNA levels, suggesting that the antagonist works at the post-transcriptional level."
9376,0.003,3.0,"The increasing prevalence of HIV-1 subtype B' in China and Southeast Asia calls for efforts to develop a relevant animal model to study viral transmission and pathogenesis. Because there are significant differences between subtype B' HIV-1 and other chimeric simian/human immunodeficiency viru (SHIVs) in the env gene, a novel SHIV, designated SHIV(B'WHU), was generated by replacing counterparts of SHIV(SF33) with tat/rev/vpu/env genes derived from a primary, CCR5-tropic, subtype B' HIV-1 strain of a Chinese patient. SHIV(B'WHU) was able to replicate in rhesus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used CCR5 as its major coreceptor. Moreover, after serial passages in Chinese macaques, the in vivo infectivity of SHIV(B'WHU) was enhanced, yet no significant sequence changes were found in viral envelopes, and the virus did not change its CCR5-tropism. CD4(+) T-cell loss, however, was found in the intraepithelial lymphocytes of small intestines of infected macaques. Our findings have implications in understanding the early pathogenesis of SHIV(B'WHU) in Chinese macaques."

Assessment of HIV serostatus of hospitalized patients is rarely performed, however, because of a reluctance to intrude on patient confidentiality, a perceived lack of benefit (no antiretroviral therapy is available), and societal denial. We evaluated the effect on health care of HIV testing of patients routinely admitted to medical wards in the 2 major city hospitals in Harare, Zimbabwe. Of 196 patients tested, 58% were HIV positive with strong associations with infectious diseases, and with youth and weight loss, but not with cardiac, pulmonary, endocrinologic, or renal diagnoses, and not with rural versus urban location, occupation, sex, mortality, or cost of hospitalization. The clinical estimate of patients' HIV serostatus was largely inaccurate. Mandatory HIV testing of all hospitalized patients would improve diagnosis of infectious diseases, clarify patient prognosis, allow for individual counseling with regard to HIV prevention, and focus national health efforts by providing alarming, realistic statistics."
9046,0.003,3.0,"A cross-sectional study was conducted on HIV-infected adults being treated with antiretroviral drugs at a reference service in Southern Brazil. Participants answered a sociodemographic questionnaire and were tested by scales assessing sociocognitive variables. Adherence to treatment was assessed by a self-report inventory developed for the study. Clinical information was obtained from the patients' records. Significance tests were conducted using univariate logistic regressions followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 195 patients participated in the study and 56.9% of them reported > or = 95% adherence on the previous two days. In univariate analysis, the odds of adherence increased with self-efficacy (a person's conviction that he/she can successfully execute the behavior required to produce a certain desired outcome) in taking medications as prescribed (OR = 3.50, 95% CI 1.90-6.55), and decreased with perception of negative affect and physical concerns (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95). The odds were lower for taking antiretroviral medications >4 times a day (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20-0.94) and higher for patients with 8 years of schooling (OR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.12-4.66). In the multivariate analysis, self-efficacy (OR = 3.33, 95% CI 1.69-6.56) and taking medication >4 times a day (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.80) were independently associated with adherence. Self-efficacy was the most important predictor of adherence, followed by number of times antiretroviral medication was taken per day. Among sociodemographic and clinical variables, only the number of years of schooling was associated with adherence. Motivational interventions based on self-efficacy may be useful for increasing treatment adherence."
3018,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem throughout the world. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) induces acute hepatitis with a case-fatality rate of about 1%. Even more important, 5-10% of patients infected with HBV become chronic carries and about 25% of these will die due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The reservoir of HBV chronic carriers in the world is estimated at more than 200 million people and 80% of them reside in Asia and the western Pacific. In high-incidence areas, such as south-east Asia, perinatal transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns appears to be the most important factor for the high prevalence of HBV infection and 70-90% of infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers become chronic carriers. Three possibilities of transmission of HBV from carrier mothers to newborns are suggested: (a) transplacental transmission in utero - it was estimated that such transmission occurred in 5-15% of newborns; (b) transmission during delivery, which is considered the main mode of perinatal transmission; (c) postnatal transmission from mother to newborn, which is not common. HBeAg is the main maternal factor in determining whether infection of newborns will occur; the expression of this antigen seems to be determined genetically. Recently it has shown that immunoprophylaxis is highly effective in preventing the development of the carrier state in infants born to HBsAg/HBeAg-positive mothers. Only 5-10% of high-risk infants are not protected by vaccination. If it becomes possible to immunize the entire world population including all babies born to carrier mothers at birth, and if our knowledge of the mechanisms of perinatal transmission of HBV is accurate, the carriers and acute cases of HB ought to disappear in two to three generations."
1279,0.003,3.0,"A study was undertaken to assess the state of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hemodialysis patients. From 97 hemodialysis patients tested, 51 were found to have at least one hepatitis B virus specific marker. 18 were HBsAg carriers, 12 of these carriers have to be regarded as infectious as judged from the presence of HBeAg and/or HBV-specific DNA polymerase activity in the serum. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were found in the sera of approximately 20% of the hemodialysis patients with a high prevalence in cases which lacked HBV markers. We conclude from our study that HBsAg-positive hemodialysis patients should be dialyzed in a separate unit and preferably served by personnel which is anti-HBs-positive. The question whether patients in which anti-HBc represents the only HBV marker should be separated is still open and needs further work. The role of non-A/non-B infection is difficult to determine and further studies are needed to elucidate this question."
2295,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to be the most important target for the diagnosis and immune prophylaxis of HBV infection. HBsAg-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are extensively used for studying the complex structure of the HBsAg, mapping the neutralizing epitopes and development of HBV diagnostic tests. However, the efficiency of anti-HBV binding strongly depends on the epitope structure and MAb capability to recognize different HBV variants. In the current study, 9 MAbs against yeast-expressed HBsAg of ayw2 serotype were generated and 7 of them were shown to recognize a linear epitope comprising amino acid (aa) residues 119-GPCRTCT-125 within the main antigenic ""a"" determinant of HBsAg. One MAb of the highest affinity (clone HB1) was selected for detailed cross-reactivity studies, generation of recombinant single-chain antibody (scFv) and molecular modelling of antibody-epitope interaction. The importance of each aa residue within the identified MAb epitope was determined by alanine substitution study that revealed aa residues C(121), T(123), C(124) and T(125) as essential for binding. These aa residues are highly conserved among HBV variants. In contrast, alanine substitution of G119, P120 and R122 had no or minor influence on the reactivity with the MAb. Certain aa residues at position 122 (either R or K) define different HBV serotypes (either d or y), therefore, the affinity of the MAb HB1 for the epitope with R122K substitution was determined to evaluate its diagnostic potential. The MAb recognized both epitope variants with high affinity. Sequence alignment of the MAb epitope within different HBV strains demonstrated that the shortest peptide recognized by the MAb 121-CR(K)TCT-125 is identical among different human HBV genotypes (HBV A-F, H) and monkey HBV species (HBVCP, HBVGO, HBVGB, WMHBV). In line with these data, the MAb HB1 was cross-reactive in Western blot with a large panel of antigens derived from different HBV genotypes. Recombinant scFv consisting of immunoglobulin VH and VL regions joined by a 20 aa-long linker was generated by cloning the respective cDNA sequences from hybridoma HB1. The recombinant scFv generated in Escherichia coli recognized the same epitope as the parental MAb HB1. Cloning of HB1 VH and VL regions allowed determination of their primary structure and subsequent computer modeling of antibody-epitope interaction. The generated molecular models of HB1 variable region with its target peptides were in accordance with experimental data showing the importance of certain aa residues in antibody binding. In conclusion, the current study describes new HBsAg-specific antibodies with HBV-neutralizing potency and a broad cross-reactivity against different HBV strains. The generated MAb HB1 will be of great value in diagnostic and research settings, while the recombinant HB1-derived scFv represents a promising ""building block"" for producing anti-HBV tools with a potential biopharmaceutical application.

3986,0.003,3.0,"An integrated HIV-1 genomic DNA leads to an infected cell becoming either an active or a latent virus-producing cell. Upon appropriate activation, a latently infected cell can result in production of progeny viruses that spread the infection to uninfected cells. The host proteins influence several steps of HIV-1 infection including formation of the preintegration complex (PIC), a key nucleoprotein intermediate essential for integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into the chromosome. Much effort has gone into the identification of host proteins contributing to the assembly of functional PICs. Experimental approaches included the use of yeast two-hybrid system, co-immunoprecipitation, affinity tagged HIV-1 viral proteins and in vitro reconstitution of salt-stripped PIC activity. Several host proteins identified using these approaches have been shown to affect HIV-1 replication in cells and influence catalytic activities of recombinant IN in vitro. However, the comprehensive identification and characterization of host proteins associated with HIV-1 PICs of infected cells have been hindered in part by the technical limitation in acquiring sufficient amount of catalytically active PICs. To efficiently identify additional host factors associated with PICs in infected cells, we have developed the following novel approach. The catalytically active PICs from HIV-1-infected CD4+ cells were isolated using biotinylated target DNA, and the proteins selectively co-purifying with PICs have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. This technology enabled us to reveal at least 19 host proteins that are associated with HIV-1 PICs, of which 18 proteins have not been described previously with respect to HIV-1 integration. Physiological functions of the identified proteins range from chromatin organization to protein transport. A detailed characterization of these host proteins could provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 integration and uncover new antiviral targets to block HIV-1 integration."

A total of 541 MSM was recruited using peer-referral, community outreach, and Internet. Questionnaire-based interviews provided information including, demographics, sexual and other risk behaviors. HIV prevalence was 4.8%, syphilis 19.8%, HCV 0.4% and HBsAg 6.5%. The median number of lifetime male sex partners was ten. In the past 3 months, 20.7% drank alcohol > or =1 times per week. In the past month, 21.3 and 14.6% had unprotected anal intercourse with regular and casual male sex partners, respectively. Syphilis infection was associated with less education, alcohol use, finding male sex partners through bathhouses/public washrooms/parks, and diagnoses of sexual transmitted diseases (STDs). Syphilis is now epidemic among Beijing's MSM. Prevention efforts are urgent as HIV prevalence is already near 5%. Education, condom promotion, STD control, and alcohol-related intervention are needed urgently."
1998,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) utilizes a distinctive form of gene regulation as part of its life cycle, termed programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, to produce the required ratio of the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. We carried out a sequence comparison of 1,000 HIV-1 sequences at the slippery site (UUUUUUA) and found that the site is invariant, which is somewhat surprising for a virus known for its variability. This prompted us to prepare a series of mutations to examine their effect upon frameshifting and viral infectivity. Among the series of mutations were changes of the HIV-1 slippery site to those effectively utilized by other viruses, because such mutations would be anticipated to have a relatively mild effect upon frameshifting. The results demonstrate that any change to the slippery site reduced frameshifting levels and also dramatically inhibited infectivity. Because ribosomal frameshifting is essential for HIV-1 replication and it is surprisingly resistant to mutation, modulation of HIV-1 frameshifting efficiency potentially represents an important target for the development of novel antiviral therapeutics."
7651,0.003,3.0,"Several cell clones possessing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome, consisting of an almost full-length DNA sequence, were isolated by limiting dilution of the clonal cell line M10 derived from MT-4 that survived infection with HIV-1 vpr mutant (M10/vpr-). One of the isolated clones (termed Vpr-1) expressed only doubly spliced mRNA, but not unspliced or singly spliced mRNA. Western blots of Vpr-1 revealed the presence of the nef translation product, although no expression of major structural genes such as gag, pol, and env was detected by indirect immunofluorescence and assay of reverse transcriptase activity. These HIV-1 phenotypes differed greatly from those of the original M10/vpr-, most of which expressed major structural HIV-1 proteins. Despite undetectable levels of env expression in Vpr-1, CD4 antigens were greatly down-modulated on the surface without alteration of steady-state levels of CD4 mRNA expression, similar to M10/vpr-. These HIV-1 phenotypes in Vpr-1 did not change after the treatment of the cells with both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and phytohemagglutinin. Therefore, the abnormal HIV-1 life cycle in Vpr-1 seems to be due to some viral factor(s), as well as cellular factors. Thus, Vpr-1 could be a useful model for understanding one HIV-1 latent form."
4530,0.003,3.0,"In the United States, 10 million inmates are released every year, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevalence is several-fold greater in criminal justice populations than in the community. Few effective linkage-to-the-community programs are currently available for prisoners infected with HIV. As a result, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is seldom continued after release, and virological and immunological outcomes worsen. Poor HIV treatment outcomes result from a myriad of obstacles that released prisoners face upon reentering the community, including homelessness, lack of medical insurance, relapse to drug and alcohol use, and mental illness. This article will focus on 5 distinct factors that contribute significantly to treatment outcomes for released prisoners infected with HIV and have profound individual and public health implications: (1) adaptation of case management services to facilitate linkage to care; (2) continuity of cART; (3) treatment of substance use disorders; (4) continuity of mental illness treatment; and (5) reducing HIV-associated risk-taking behaviors as part of secondary prevention."

High attrition rates have been reported in the Caribbean region, varying from 6% to 23%. We studied the incidence of and risk factors for intermittent care in a cohort of adult HIV-1-positive patients, who entered into care in Curaçao between January 2005 and July 2009. A total of 214 therapy-naïve HIV-1-infected patients aged 15 years or older, entered HIV care between January 2005 and July 2009. Intermittent care was defined as at least one period of 365 days or longer in which there was no HIV care contact in Curaçao. Cox regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with time to intermittent care. In all, 203 (95%) patients could be classified as having intermittent or continuous care. The incidence of intermittent care before starting cART was 25.4 per 100 person years observation (PYO), whilst it was 6.1 per 100 PYO after starting cART. Being born outside Curaçao was associated with intermittent care before and after starting cART. Time from diagnosis to entry into care was an independent predictor for intermittent care before starting cART. Younger age was independently associated with intermittent care after starting cART. Half of the patients returned to care after intermitting care. Upon returning to care, median CD4 count was 264 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 189-401) for those who intermitted care before starting cART, and 146 cells/mm(3) (IQR, 73-436) in those who intermitted care after starting cART. In conclusion, the incidence of intermitting care is high in Curaçao, especially before starting cART, and intermitting care before starting cART is an independent predictor for starting cART late. "

A retrospective questionnaire survey was conducted of infants and children with HIV exposure or infection evaluated by pediatric HIV referral centers in the United States comprising the pediatric units or subunits of the Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Clinical Trials Group (PACTG). Seventy of 72 sites during a mean period of 5 (range, 1 to 12) years participated in this study and had provided care for 14,038 patients. There were 75 cumulative total cases of tuberculosis disease seen since each site was established. Therapy for asymptomatic infection was given to another 40 children and for tuberculosis exposure to 71 children. Annualized case rates were 478/100,000 for sites established in 1990 to 1992, 117/100,000 for 1988 to 1989, 63/100,000 for 1986 to 1987 and 58/100,000 for 1981 to 1985 (P = 0.05, Spearman's p test for trend). By comparison, the 1992 age-specific tuberculosis case rate for all U.S. children < 5 years was 5.5/100,000.

782,0.003,3.0,"This study is the first prospective study to assess the prevalence, epidemiology, and risk factors of HIV-1 drug resistance in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients in Belgium. In January 2003 it was initiated as part of the pan-European SPREAD program, and continued thereafter for four inclusion rounds until December 2006. Epidemiological, clinical, and behavioral data were collected using a standardized questionnaire and genotypic resistance testing was done on a sample taken within 6 months of diagnosis. Two hundred and eighty-five patients were included. The overall prevalence of transmitted HIV-1 drug resistance in Belgium was 9.5% (27/285, 95% CI: 6.6-13.4). Being infected in Belgium, which largely coincided with harboring a subtype B virus, was found to be significantly associated with transmission of drug resistance. The relatively high rate of baseline resistance might jeopardize the success of first line treatment as more than 1 out of 10 (30/285, 10.5%) viruses did not score as fully susceptible to one of the recommended first-line regimens, i.e., zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz. Our results support the implementation of genotypic resistance testing as a standard of care in all treatment-naive patients in Belgium."

A convenience sample of 358 gay men was recruited in two gay bars. Exploratory factor analysis performed on the first split-half sample was used to assess the factor structure from five scales measuring beliefs about HBV vaccination. The scales were based on constructs from the health belief model and the social cognitive theory. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the remaining half-sample using structural equation modeling. Multivariable analysis further validated the scales. These findings propose standardized measures that may be useful in assessing the beliefs and attitudes of gay men toward HBV vaccination to guide intervention design and evaluation."

7794,0.003,3.0,"Studies examining the sex differences in morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis of sex differences in disease progression and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients. Medical literature databases from inception to August 2014 were searched for published observational studies assessing sex differences in immunologic and virologic response, disease progression and mortality among HIV-infected patients. Random effects meta-analyses of 115 eligible studies were conducted to obtain pooled estimates of outcomes and heterogeneity was explored in sub-group analyses. Pooled estimates showed an increased risk of progression to AIDS (relative risk [RR]=1.11,95% CI=1.02-1.21) and all-cause mortality (RR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.29) among males compared to females. All-cause mortality differed by sex only in low and middle income countries. The risk of AIDS-related mortality (RR=1.03, 95% CI=0.82-1.30), immunologic failure (RR=1.19,95% CI: 0.97-1.47), virologic suppression (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.84-1.14), virologic failure (RR=1.26, 95% CI=0.99-1.61) and the change in CD4 cell count (Weighted mean difference [WMD] = -5.15, 95% CI= -13.57 to 3.28) did not differ by sex. These findings were modified by disease severity, adherence and use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. We conclude that HIV-related disease progression and survival outcomes are poorer in males. "

It is a multi-centre, prospective observational study conducted between August 1997 and July 1998. The 483 patients, enrolled in five infectious diseases departments located in different areas of Italy, were stratified into four groups according to their CD4+ lymphocyte cell count and status of AIDS Defining Illness (ADI) at enrolment. Average direct hospital costs (L = Italian Lire, 1997 exchange rate US$ 1 = 1,704 Italian Lire) were L.23,725,584 (US$ 13,923.5), L.15,208,287 (US$ 8,925.1), L.11,942,761 (US$ 7,008.7) and L.7,660,942 (US$ 4,495.9) for the four groups of patients. More than 80% of patients in the first group and about 65% of patients in the second group received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The proportion of patients receiving HAART in the third and fourth group increased from 37.1% to 56.5% and from 15.3% to 31.5%.

2798,0.003,3.0,"Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a widely used procedure for AIDS-related lymphomas, and it represents an opportunity to evaluate strategies curing HIV-1 infection. The association of autograft HIV-DNA load with peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir before ASCT and its contribution in predicting HIV-1 reservoir size and stability during combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) after transplantation are unknown. Aiming to obtain information suggesting new functional cure strategies by ASCT, we retrospectively evaluated HIV-DNA load in autograft and in peripheral blood before and after transplantation in 13 cART-treated HIV-1 relapse/refractoring lymphoma patients. Among them seven discontinued cART after autograft infusion. HIV-DNA was evaluated by a sensitive quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After debulking chemotherapy/mobilization, the autograft HIV-1 reservoir was higher than and not associated with the peripheral HIV-1 reservoir at baseline [median 215 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) autograft mononuclear cells, range 13-706 vs. 82 HIV-DNA copies/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), range 13-479, p = 0.03]. After high dose chemotherapy and autograft infusion, HIV-DNA levels reached a plateau between month 6 and 12 of follow-up. No association was found between peripheral HIV-DNA levels at baseline and after infusion in both cART interrupting and not interrupting patients. Only in the last subgroup, a stable significant linear association between autograft and peripheral blood HIV-1 reservoir emerged from month 1 (R(2) = 0.84, p = 0.01) to month 12 follow-up (R(2) = 0.99, p = 0.0005). In summary, autograft HIV-1 reservoir size could be influenced by the mobilization phase and predicts posttransplant peripheral HIV-1 reservoir size in patients on continuous cART. These findings could promote new research on strategies reducing the HIV-1 reservoir by using the ASCT procedure."
2258,0.003,3.0,"Comparative sequence analysis of different isolates of hepatitis G virus (HGV) has demonstrated significant intersubject genetic heterogeneity, but few data on intrasubject genetic evolution have been reported. To further investigate the genetic diversification of the HGV genome, 36 plasma samples from eleven patients chronically infected with HGV serially obtained 2-4 years apart were analysed. We determined the viral nucleotide sequence of the 5' non-coding (NC) and the NS3 regions by directly sequencing the RT-PCR amplified products obtained from the viral RNAs. Intrasubject sequence variation was found to be 1.3-2.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the 5' NC region and 1.3-9.4 x 10(-3) base substitutions per genome site per year within the NS3 region. Depending on the genomic region analysed (i.e. 5' NC or NS3 region), pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic reconstructions showed that intersubject genetic distances were 17.5- to 20.8-fold greater than intrasubject ones. Overall, the evolution rate of HGV in the regions analysed is not significantly different from that found in hepatitis C virus."
3239,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 RNA levels in semen and blood compartments decrease below detection limits during highly active antiretroviral therapy. Despite these therapeutic effects, it is clear that persistent, latent HIV-1 reservoirs are capable of rebounding in the absence of drug treatment or by evolution of escape mutants remain. The current study was designed to examine the presence of latent virus in semen and blood compartments and its evolution following potent combination therapy with indinavir (protease inhibitor) and efavirenz [nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor]. Using an ultrasensitive in situ hybridization assay HIV-1 mRNA was detected in cultured seminal and blood mononuclear cells in all patients up to 1789 days posttherapy. Higher levels of HIV-1 mRNA were consistently detected in seminal mononuclear cells as compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in all time points analyzed posttherapy. Analysis of viral RNA from cultured PBMC before and after therapy displayed no evidence of therapy-induced drug resistance in the viral polymerase gene in the majority of patients. However, distinct envelope populations were detected in these viral RNA populations following therapy, indicating possible selection of quasispecies. The observed ongoing replication and evolution in the PBMC viral envelope sequences likely occurred in the seminal compartment HIV populations, given that the seminal cells showed the ability to express HIV-1 mRNA following cultivation. This together with our previous studies (Gupta P, et al.: J Infect Dis 2000;182:79-87) suggest that the genital and blood compartments likely serve as distinct reservoirs harboring latent HIV-1 during prolonged drug therapy."

QOL and medical data were collected from 1,563 of the 1,571 participants at entry into a randomized clinical trial of ART conducted in the U.S. (n = 203) and 8 resource-limited countries (n = 1,360) in the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and Africa. Participants were interviewed prior to initiation of ART using a modified version of the ACTG SF-21, a health-related QOL measure including 8 subscales: general health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, mental health, and energy/fatigue. Other measures included demographics, CD4+ lymphocyte count, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. Higher quality of life in each of the 8 QOL subscales was associated with higher CD4+ lymphocyte category. General health perception, physical functioning, role functioning, and energy/fatigue varied by plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load categories. Each QOL subscale included significant variation by country. Only the social functioning subscale varied by sex, with men having greater impairments than women, and only the physical functioning subscale varied by age category. This was the first large-scale international ART trial to conduct a standardized assessment of QOL in diverse international settings, thus demonstrating that implementation of the behavioral assessment was feasible. QOL indicators at study entry varied with disease severity, demographics, and country. The relationship of these measures to treatment outcomes can and should be examined in clinical trials of ART in resource-limited settings using similar methodologies."

We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP."
3057,0.003,3.0,"The woodchuck together with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is an excellent model to study the pathogenesis of hepadnaviral infections. Chronic WHV infection causes severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma in woodchucks. The mechanism of viral clearance is not fully understood, interferons seem to play a major role in down-regulating viral replication prior to elimination of infected hepatocytes. We investigated on the pattern of cytokine and T-cell-marker expression in livers of woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. RNase-protection-assay (RPA) was used to determine mRNA of woodchuck specific genes (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-15, CD3, CD4, CD8). Serial liver biopsies were performed daily or weekly in eight chronic WHV-carrier woodchucks. Cytokine/T-cell-marker expression differed significantly between the time points up to +/-50% within each woodchuck. The different expression patterns of cytokines or T-cell-markers did not correlate to the (weak) fluctuations in the viremia but may explain the observed fluctuations in the WHV/HBV-load in chronically infected individuals. Furthermore, we observed associations between cytokine and T-cell-marker expression. The marginal fluctuations in viremia during the chronic infection may indicate, that, once the chronic hepadnaviral infection is established, cytokines/interferons expressed endogenously (i.e. not vector-borne or injected) play only a minor role."
998,0.003,3.0,"In 2005, Pakistan was first labeled as a country with concentrated epidemic of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This was revealed through second generation surveillance conducted by HIV/AIDS Surveillance Project (HASP). While injection drug users (IDUs) were driving the epidemic, subsequent surveys showed that Hijra (transgender) sex workers (HSWs) were emerging as the second most vulnerable group with an average national prevalence of 6.4%. An exceptionally high prevalence (27.6%) was found in Larkana, which is a small town on the right bank of river Indus near the ruins of Mohenjo-Daro in the province of Sindh. This paper presents the risk factors associated with high prevalence of HIV among HSWs in Larkana as compared to other cities of the country."
8865,0.003,3.0,"The deleterious effect of HIV on the immune system begins at the time of infection. At seroconversion the virologic and immunologic factors that ultimately will dictate the rate of disease progression are believed to be already in place. The concept developed in this paper implies that, to impact significantly on the progression of disease, anti-HIV therapies should be initiated as early as possible in asymptomatic individuals. Published results have shown that combination drug therapies are potent in reducing HIV-1 RNA load in plasma in asymptomatic individuals, and that some HIV-1 immune-based therapies have a positive impact on immunological markers of disease progression, including HIV-1 cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and CD4 percent. The strategy discussed is to test a combination of antiretroviral therapy with HIV-1 immune-based therapy, such as the inactivated HIV-1 immunogen preparation, in asymptomatic individuals. The goal of this combination approach is to overcome the limitations of each therapy alone. Preliminary data suggest that antiretroviral therapy and the HIV-1 Immunogen can be combined with no noticeable interference and/or added toxicity in a broad range of HIV-1-infected individuals. Combining both therapies may enhance and expand the impact on key surrogate markers of disease progression, although they likely achieve this impact through different mechanisms. Thus, the primary question remains: Can these effects be synergistic?"
487,0.003,3.0,"Twenty cases of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in HIV-infected patients were reviewed over a 10-year-period, divided into Group A, including 13 NHL cases treated before the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, and Group B, including 7 patients who received HAART. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was performed and log-rank was applied to assess statistical differences between the groups. In group A, the median CD4 count was 36 cells/mm3. No complete remission was found. In group B, the median CD4 count was 137 cells/mm3. Four patients (57.0%) are still alive and in complete remission. Group A had a median survival of 5 months and group B 31 months (p = 0.0032). Our results are in agreement with recent reports in that a higher CD4 count and better immune status achieved with HAART is predictive of a better outcome. We found that HAART in combination with chemotherapy improves overall survival of NHL patients without increasing adverse effects."
10011,0.003,3.0,"Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells play a central role in the control of viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. However, despite the presence of strong and broad HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in chronic HIV-1 infection, these cells progressively lose critical effector functions and fail to clear the infection. Mounting evidence suggests that the upregulation of several inhibitory regulatory receptors on the surface of CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection may contribute directly to the impairment of T-cell function. Here, we investigated the role of killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIR), which are expressed on NK cells and on CD8(+) T cells, in regulating CD8(+) T-cell function in HIV-1 infection. KIR expression was progressively upregulated on CD8(+) T cells during HIV-1 infection and correlated with the level of viral replication. Expression of KIR was associated with a profound inhibition of cytokine secretion, degranulation, proliferation, and activation by CD8(+) T cells following stimulation with T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent stimuli. In contrast, KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells responded potently to TCR-independent stimulation, demonstrating that these cells are functionally competent. KIR-associated suppression of CD8(+) T-cell function was independent of ligand engagement, suggesting that these regulatory receptors may constitutively repress TCR activation. This ligand-independent repression of TCR activation of KIR(+) CD8(+) T cells may represent a significant barrier to therapeutic interventions aimed at improving the quality of the HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response in infected individuals."
5636,0.003,3.0,"We investigated the role of the two highly conserved cysteine residues, cysteines 67 and 95, of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease in regulating the activity of that protease during viral maturation. To this end, we generated four HIV-1 molecular clones: the wild type, containing both cysteine residues; a protease mutant in which the cysteine at position 67 was replaced by an alanine (C67A); a C95A protease mutant; and a double mutant (C67A C95A). When immature virions were produced in the presence of an HIV-1 protease inhibitor, KNI-272, and the inhibitor was later removed, limited polyprotein processing was observed for wild-type virion preparations over a 20-h period. Treatment of immature wild-type virions with the reducing agent dithiothreitol considerably improved the rate and extent of Gag processing, suggesting that the protease is, in part, reversibly inactivated by oxidation of the cysteine residues. In support of this, C67A C95A virions processed Gag up to fivefold faster than wild-type virions in the absence of a reducing agent. Furthermore, oxidizing agents, such as H2O2 and diamide, inhibited Gag processing of wild-type virions, and this effect was dependent on the presence of cysteine 95. Electron microscopy revealed that a greater percentage of double-mutant virions than wild-type virions developed a mature-like morphology on removal of the inhibitor. These studies provide evidence that under normal culture conditions the cysteines of the HIV-1 protease are susceptible to oxidation during viral maturation, thus preventing immature virions from undergoing complete processing following their release. This is consistent with the cysteines being involved in the regulation of viral maturation in cells under oxidative stress."
2063,0.003,3.0,"Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a critical mediator of immunity to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Although IFN has been used in the treatment of viral hepatitis for more than a decade, the role of IFN-alpha-receptor in HBV infection has not been intensively studied. We have evaluated the impact of two variants of the IFNAR1 gene on the outcome of HBV infection. Four hundred and fifty eight HBV-infected Vietnamese patients, with well-characterised clinical profiles including all forms of hepatic disease, and 160 non-infected, healthy Vietnamese individuals were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 54 had acute hepatitis B, 88 had chronic hepatitis B, 118 had liver cirrhosis, 146 had a hepatocellular carcinoma and 52 were asymptomatic carriers of HBV. We analysed two SNPs for unequal distribution between these groups. The first SNP, rs1012335 is situated in intron 3 of the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1). A C at position 17470 in the IFNAR1 on both chromosomes was detected more frequently in HBV-infected patients compared to healthy controls (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.46-4.72, p < 0.001). The same homozygosity is also associated with higher concentrations of AST and ALT (aspartate and alanine amino-transferase) in the plasma of the patients. The second SNP (rs2257167) is situated in exon 4, causing a change of amino acids from Val (GTT) to Leu (CTT). Subjects having GTT on both chromosomes were more frequent in the healthy control group (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.35-0.84, p = 0.004) and had lower plasma ALT concentrations. The findings indicate that two variants of the IFNAR1 gene are associated with the clinical presentation of HBV infection."
4654,0.003,3.0,"The envelope proteins of hepatitis B virus (HBV) bear an N-linked glycosylation site at N146 within the immunodominant a-determinant in the antigenic loop (AGL) region. This glycosylation site is never fully functional, leading to a nearly 1/1 ratio of glycosylated/nonglycosylated isoforms in the viral envelope. Here we investigated the requirement for a precise positioning of N-linked glycan at amino acid 146 and the functions associated with the glycosylated and nonglycosylated isoforms. We observed that the removal of the N146 glycosylation site by mutagenesis was permissive to envelope protein synthesis and stability and to secretion of subviral particles (SVPs) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) virions, but it was detrimental to HBV virion production. Several positions in the AGL could substitute for position 146 as the glycosylation acceptor site. At position 146, neither a glycan chain nor asparagine was absolutely required for infectivity, but there was a preference for a polar residue. Envelope proteins bearing 5 AGL glycosylation sites became hyperglycosylated, leading to an increased capacity for SVP secretion at the expense of HBV and HDV virion secretion. Infectivity-compatible N-glycosylation sites could be inserted at 3 positions (positions 115, 129, and 136), but when all three positions were glycosylated, the hyperglycosylated mutant was substantially attenuated at viral entry, while it acquired resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Taken together, these findings suggest that the nonglycosylated N146 is essential for infectivity, while the glycosylated form, in addition to its importance for HBV virion secretion, is instrumental in shielding the a-determinant from neutralizing antibodies."
3659,0.003,3.0,"We report the case of an HIV-infected patient who has been followed for 20 years, and despite presenting with AIDS (due to three episodes of cryptococcosis plus one of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) who during subsequent years missed, refused or took with limited compliance all recommended medications, including combination antiretroviral therapy, and primary and secondary antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections. The unexpected clinical and laboratory stabilization of our patient paralleled a progressive increase in his peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (range 410-825 cells/mL) and a relatively controlled HIV viraemia (5970-44,000 HIV-RNA copies/mL). Such a recovery of sufficient immune competency after experiencing four episodes of severe AIDS-associated opportunistic infections, without reliable antiretroviral and antimicrobial support raises several questions."
9007,0.003,3.0,"We hypothesized that rapid presentation may be a general feature of tuberculosis (TB) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that limits the impact of HIV on the point prevalence of TB. To investigate this, we performed a cross-sectional HIV and TB disease survey with retrospective and prospective follow-up. HIV prevalence among 1,773 systematically recruited miners was 27%. TB incidence was much more strongly HIV associated (incidence rate ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5-8.6) than the point prevalence of undiagnosed TB disease (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9-3.3). For smear-positive TB, 7 of 9 (78%) prevalent cases were HIV negative, and point prevalence was nonsignificantly lower in miners who were HIV positive (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.1-4.2). The calculated mean duration of smear positivity before diagnosis (point prevalence/incidence) was substantially shorter for HIV-positive than HIV-negative TB patients (0.17 and 1.15 years, respectively; ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.00-0.73). HIV has considerably less impact on the point prevalence of TB disease than on TB incidence, probably because rapid disease progression increases presentation and case-finding rates. The difference in mean duration of smear positivity was particularly marked and, if generalizable, will have major implications for TB control prospects in high HIV prevalence areas."
7447,0.003,3.0,"Commencement of antiretroviral treatment (ART) in severely immunosuppressed HIV-infected persons is associated with unmasking of subclinical disease. The subset of patients that are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) disease while on ART have been classified as ART-associated TB. Few studies have reported the incidence of ART-associated TB and unmasking TB-IRIS according to the International Network for the Study of HIV-Associated IRIS (INSHI) consensus definition. To determine the incidence and predictors of ART-associated TB, we screened 219 patients commencing ART at the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Kampala, Uganda for TB by symptoms, sputum microscopy, and chest X-rays and followed them for one year. Fourteen (6.4%) patients were diagnosed with TB during followup. Eight (3.8%) patients had ART-associated TB (incidence rate of 4.3 per 100 person years); of these, three patients fulfilled INSHI criteria for unmasking TB-associated IRIS (incidence rate of 1.6 per 100 person years). A body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m(2) BMI (HR 5.85 95% CI 1.24-27.46, P = .025) and a C-reactive protein greater than 5 mg/L (HR 8.23 95% CI 1.36-38.33, P = .020) were risk factors for ART-associated TB at multivariate analysis. In conclusion, with systematic TB screening (including culture and chest X-ray), the incidence of ART-associated TB is relatively low in settings with high HIV and TB prevalence."
5143,0.003,3.0,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) nearby the IL28B gene have been associated with spontaneous hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and response to interferon-based therapies in both monoinfected and HIV-coinfected patients. However, its impact on spontaneous clearance of HBV (the pathogenesis of which is also related to interferon) is less known. A case-control study was performed. Cases were 49 HIV(+) patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBsAg(+) for more than 6 months) who had been genotyped for the rs12979860 SNP (protective CC genotype). One control for each case was chosen among HIV patients with anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Controls were matched for gender and coinfection with HCV. Most patients were male (90%) and the median (IQR) age was 42.6 (39-46.7) years. Eighteen (36.7%) were also coinfected by HCV. Among HBsAg(+) patients, 19 (41.3%) were HBeAg(+) and 13 (26.5%) were also infected with hepatitis delta (HDV). No differences were found in the distribution of the CC genotype between patients with chronic hepatitis B and those who spontaneously cured hepatitis B: 59.2% vs. 44.9%; p=0.3. Thus, the interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype does not seem to have a role in the development of chronic hepatitis B among HIV-infected patients."
4368,0.003,3.0,"We previously reported that inhibition of endosomal/lysosomal function can dramatically enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectivity, suggesting that under these conditions productive HIV-1 infection can occur via the endocytic pathway. Here we further examined this effect with bafilomycin A1 (BFLA-1) and show that this enhancement of infectivity extends to all HIV-1 isolates tested regardless of coreceptor usage. However, isolate-specific differences were observed in the magnitude of the effect. This was particularly evident in the case of the weakly infectious HIV-1(SF2), for which we observed the greatest enhancement. Using reciprocal chimeric viruses, we were able to determine that both the disproportionate increase in the infectivity of HIV-1(SF2) in response to BFLA-1 and its weak infectivity in the absence of BFLA-1 mapped to its envelope gene. Further, we found HIV-1(SF2) to have lower fusion activity and to be 12-fold more sensitive to the fusion inhibitor T-20 than HIV-1(NL4-3). Proteasomal inhibitors also enhance HIV-1 infectivity, and we report that the combination of a lysosomal and a proteasomal inhibitor greatly enhanced infectivity of all isolates tested. Again, HIV-1(SF2) was unique in exhibiting a synergistic 400-fold increase in infectivity. We also determined that inhibition of proteasomal function increased the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. The evidence presented here highlights the important role of the lysosomes/proteasomes in the destruction of infectious HIV-1(SF2) and could have implications for the development of novel antiviral agents that might take advantage of these innate defenses."
9120,0.003,3.0,"Directly observed therapy (DOT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is commonly used in correctional settings; however, the efficacy of DOT for treating HIV infection has not been determined. We prospectively assessed adherence to antiretroviral therapy regimens among 31 HIV-infected prison inmates who were receiving >or=1 antiretrovirals via DOT. Adherence was measured by self-report, pill count, electronic monitoring caps, and, for DOT only, medication administration records. Overall, median adherence was 90%, as measured by pill count; 86%, by electronic monitoring caps; and 100%, by self-report. Adherence, as measured by electronic monitoring caps, was >90% in 32% of the subjects. In 91% of cases, adherence, as measured by medication administration records, was greater than that recorded by electronic monitoring caps for the same medications administered by DOT. Objective methods of measurement revealed that adherence to antiretroviral regimens administered wholly or in part by DOT was <or=90% in more than one-half of the patients. Different methods used to measure adherence revealed significantly different levels of adherence. These findings suggest that use of DOT does not ensure adherence to antiretroviral therapy."

We surveyed 154 physician anesthesiologists (MD) and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) at four university-affiliated medical centers to determine the prevalence of serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Questionnaires were used to ascertain historical and demographic information, nonoccupational risk factors, and characteristics of the participants' anesthesia practice. The overall prevalence of seropositivity was 18.8% (range 10.2-30.3%), and there were no statistically significant differences among the four centers, MD and CRNA groups, or males and females. In contrast to other studies, the prevalence of seropositive markers did not increase with an increase in the participants' age or length of time in the specialty. For the groups sampled in this study, geographic location or type of practice did not influence the increased prevalence of HBV seropositivity in anesthesia personnel. The current methods of HBV infection control were not associated with a decreased prevalence of serum markers. The majority of the susceptible anesthesia personnel at these four institutions did not plan to receive the hepatitis B vaccine when surveyed at the time of this study."
6196,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem and an important cause of morbidity and mortality from sequelae of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In the past decades, better understanding of the natural history and immunopathogenesis of chronic HBV infection and of the development of many powerful antiviral agents has allowed us to improve therapeutic efficacy. Among these agents, nucleos(t)ide analogs are important and potent viral suppressors. However, when administered alone, they are not able to permanently eradicate HBV, and long-term maintenance therapy is required for therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, prolonged treatment is frequently associated with the emergence of drug-resistant HBV mutants. Before an 'ideal' drug(s), or drug combination, with optimal antiviral efficacy and negligible rates of drug resistance becomes available, the on-treatment monitoring approach using serum HBV DNA level as a predictor for therapeutic efficacy and drug resistance is useful. However, most countries in the Asia-Pacific region have low income economies, insufficient medical care systems, and low awareness of the disease among the general population and government officers. The easy approach of the road-map concept using an affordable drug to treat chronic HBV infection is more important in this region. There is already evidence that the long-term outcomes of chronic HBV infection can be improved under well-managed antiviral therapy. Profound and long-lasting suppression of HBV replication, either maintained on-therapy or sustained after stopping therapy, has been identified as the key determinant for achieving the goals of therapy, for reducing liver damage, and for preventing development of cirrhosis and/ or hepatocellular carcinoma."

The aims of this study were to determine the role of core promoter and/or precore mutations in HBeAg seroconversion and their impact on the subsequent course of liver disease, and to determine if core promoter mutations are more frequently selected in patients with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation. Serial sera from 45 patients with chronic HBV infection were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified, and the HBV core promoter and precore regions were sequenced. Ninety-two percent of patients had core promoter or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion: 42% had core promoter changes only, 38% had precore stop codon mutations only, and 12% had changes in both regions. Seventy-three percent of the patients had persistently normal aminotransferases, and only 8% had multiple flares in aminotransferases after HBeAg seroconversion. Core promoter changes were significantly more common in patients infected with HBV who have C at nucleotide 1858 (91% vs. 27%; P <.01), while precore stop codon changes were exclusively found in patients infected with HBV who have T at nucleotide 1858 (87% vs. 0; P <.01). The vast majority of our patients had core promoter and/or precore mutations after HBeAg seroconversion. Nevertheless, most patients had sustained remission of liver disease. Our data suggest that core promoter changes are preferentially selected in patients infected with HBV genotypes that preclude the development of precore stop codon mutation."
7434,0.003,3.0,"Around 5-10% of adults infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) develop a chronic liver disease such as chronic active hepatitis (CAH), and it is unclear whether the clinical outcome depends solely on the immune response or whether viral factors also play a role. In this study, a search was therefore made for nucleotide mutations in the basic core promoter (BCP) and amino-acid substitutions in the precore/core region of HBV infecting patients with CAH or with acute hepatitis. The nucleotide sequences of the BCP and of the precore/core region were determined in virus from ten patients with CAH and ten with acute hepatitis. The precore/core sequences were also analysed in 14 additional patients (6 with CAH, 8 with acute hepatitis). In seven of the ten patients with CAH, five types of mutations were found in the BCP. Deletions in the precore/core region were observed in six patients. In all six patients where only the precore/core region was studied, amino-acid substitutions were present. In contrast, in the ten patients with acute hepatitis studied for BCP, a mutation was found in the BCP of one patient only. Of the 18 patients in whom the precore/core was studied, three had an amino-acid substitution in this region. The results show a clear link between CAH and both HBV BCP and precore/core region mutations, suggesting these mutations may play a role in the persistence of HBV infection."

HCV and HIV viral load, lymphocyte CD4 counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) were measured before and 3 months after starting treatment in 2 groups: Group 1 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and Group 2 (n = 15) treated with 2 nucleoside analogues and a protease inhibitor. Results show a significant increase in lymphocyte and a significant decrease in HIV viral load in the both group but no significant change in HCV viral load and in ALT and AST.

Hepatitis B virus infection is a significant health problem which may cause chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the introduction of Hepatitis B vaccine, a significant progress has been made in the prevention of HBV infections. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the characteristics of the individuals included in the risk group who admitted to our vaccination clinic, as well as their immune responses following the vaccination. Among the patients admitted to the vaccination clinic of our hospital between January 2003-December 2005 and that were included in the risk group (patients who have family members with chronic Hepatitis B infection, healthcare workers, hemodialysis patients etc.), those who were included in the vaccination program by examining the results of HBs Ag, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were evaluated in terms of their characteristics (age, gender, smoking etc.) and results of Anti-HBs score. A total of 958 people were included in the vaccination program. Upon evaluation in terms of risk factors, presence of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection in the family was found to be 80.6% (772/958), being healthcare worker was 9.2% (88/958), HCV positivity and chronic liver disease was 3.0% (29/958), being a hemodialysis patient was 2.8% (27/958), and being an oncology patient was 2.1% (20/958). Post-vaccination immune response could be evaluated in 69.8% (669/958) of patients and no responsiveness to vaccine was detected only in 8.1% (54/669) of them. Of the non-responders, 64.8% (35/54) were hemodialysis and oncology patients. Anti-HBs positivity rate following hepatitis B vaccination program was found compatible with the results of previous studies. With this vaccine of considerably high effectiveness, immunization of the entire community including primarily the risk groups should be targeted."

The objective of the workshop was to identify appropriate biosafety practices and standard control procedures to protect workers involved in the collection, storage, and transportation of human blood donations with the least possible disruption of the nation's blood supply. Speakers focused on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, the safety principles discussed were considered equally applicable to other known (e.g., non-A, non-B hepatitis and human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) blood-transmitted infections. The resulting consensus included the need for blood establishments to develop and apply thoughtful biosafety programs to address staff training, accident prevention, HBV vaccination, handling spills, managing contaminated waste and transporting blood specimens. There was lack of agreement, however, on the usefulness of gloves during the phlebotomy of healthy blood donors."

Immediately after delivery, babies were randomized to receive either HBIG or placebo in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine (at 0, 6, 10 and 14 weeks). The primary end-point of the study, assessed at 18 weeks of age, was remaining free of any HBV infection (either overt or occult) plus the development of adequate immune response to vaccine. The babies were further followed up for a median of 2 years of age to determine their eventual outcome. Risk factors for HBV transmission and for poor immune response in babies were studied. Of the 283 eligible babies, 259 were included in the trial and randomized to receive either HBIG (n=128) or placebo (n=131) in addition to recombinant HBV vaccine. Of the 222 of 259 (86%) babies who completed 18 weeks of follow-up, only 62/222 (28%) reached primary end-point. Of the remaining, 6/222 (3%) developed overt HBV infection, 142/222 (64%) developed occult HBV infection, and 12/222 (5%) had no HBV infection but had poor immune response. All 6 overt infections occurred in the placebo group (P=0.030), while occult HBV infections were more common in the HBIG group (76/106 [72%] vs. 66/116 [57%]; P=0.025). This may be due to the immune pressure of HBIG. There was no significant difference between the two groups in frequency of babies developing poor immune response or those achieving primary end-point. The final outcome of these babies at 24 months of age was as follows: overt HBV infection 4%, occult HBV infection 42%, no HBV infection but poor immune response 8% and no HBV infection with good immune response 28%. Women who were anti-HBe positive were a low-risk group, and their babies were most likely to remain free of HBV infection (occult or overt) and had good immune response to the vaccine. Maternal HBeAg-positive status and negativity for anti-HBe predicted not only overt but also any infection (both overt and occult) in babies. In addition, high maternal HBV DNA and treatment with vaccine alone were significant factors for overt HBV infection in babies. The current practice of administration of vaccine with HBIG at birth to babies born of HBsAg-positive mothers is not effective in preventing occult HBV infection in babies, which may be up to 40%. Because the most important risk factors for mother-to-baby transmission of HBV infection are the replicative status and high HBV DNA level in mothers; it will be worthwhile investigating the role of antivirals and HBIG administration during pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV infection."
3214,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of occult hepatitis B, defined by absence of HBsAg and HBV DNA, ranges widely in patients with hepatitis C. This may influence the treatment of hepatitis C and the severity of liver disease. Sensitive and specific real-time PCR techniques are available commercially and can detect more reliably low HBV DNA levels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection using the COBAS Taqman assay (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) in the serum and liver of HBsAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis C and to evaluate its clinical consequences on liver pathology and its impact on the response to treatment with peg-IFNalpha and Ribavirin. HBV DNA detection was assessed retrospectively on 140 sera and 113 liver biopsies of HCV positive/HBsAg negative patients before treatment. A 4.4% (5/113) prevalence of occult hepatitis B was recorded in liver samples and in none of the sera. Anti-HBc was not detected in one, three of whom were sustained virological responders to treatment, one was relapsed responder and one was non-responder. Furthermore, in this cohort composed of 12% anti-HBs negative/anti-HBc positive and 20% anti-HBs positive/anti-HBc positive patients, anti-HBc was not associated with pre-therapeutic viral load, ALT serum levels, and histological activity or fibrosis. Using a commercial real-time PCR assay, we observed a low prevalence of occult B hepatitis. This, just as anti-HBC status, had no clinical impact in a large cohort of hepatitis C patients. It therefore does not appear useful to screen for occult hepatitis B in these patients with this test before beginning HCV treatment."
4820,0.003,3.0,"4000 sera were tested for antibodies against hepatitis C virus (HCV) by means of an ELISA using the C100-3 antigen. 38.9% of patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis following blood transfusion (n = 108) had HCV antibodies. Among patients with chronic liver damage of unknown origin (n = 316) 30.4% were anti-HCV positive, and in 2,506 patients with transitional or chronic elevation of transaminases 14.8% showed HCV antibodies. Haemophiliacs (n = 26) with 65.4% anti-HCV positives and drug addicts (n = 46) with 56.5% anti-HCV positives had the highest prevalence among high risk groups. Addicts dying from drug abuse (n = 216) and HIV 1 positives (n = 127) were anti-HCV positive in 37.5% and 26.0%, respectively. Patients on haemodialysis (n = 331) had antibodies against HCV in 12.4%. Health care workers (n = 217) appear to be at a comparably low risk with only 2.8% anti-HCV positives. Up to now we could not find a single case of intrafamilial spread of HCV in 46 examined cases. We suggest that HCV infectivity of contaminated body fluids and blood is lower than that of hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 carriers. In suspected non-A, non-B hepatitis negative test results should be confirmed in a second sample because it may take three to six months after infection before HCV antibodies occur. However, about 10% of chronic HCV infections are not detectable with the presently available test. This may change when new tests become available using HCV specific antigens other than C100-3."
6799,0.003,3.0,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses is a common underlying condition in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. We studied serum and liver tissue from a cohort of Alaska natives with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for evidence of hepatitis B, C and G viral infection using conventional serological tests as well as the sensitive polymerase chain reaction. Evidence of HBV infection was found in 25 and possible HCV infection in two cases. Among the remaining 11 patients, four had a history of recent or remote alcoholism while seven had no recognizable risk factors for HCC. Only one was seropositive for HGV RNA and that was an individual with a history of alcoholism. Non-tumorous liver tissue was available for study in six of these seven cases. Histological features of chronic hepatitis were present in five. Thus, at least five of 38 (13%) Alaska natives with HCC appeared to have chronic hepatitis not related to HBV or HCV infection, suggesting the possibility of some form of previously unrecognized chronic liver disease predisposing to HCC."
6425,0.003,3.0,"Loss of E-cadherin is associated with acquisition of metastatic capacity. Numerous studies suggest that histone deacetylation and/or hypermethylation of CpG islands in E-cadherin gene (CDH1) are major mechanisms responsible for E-cadherin silencing in different tumors and cancer cell lines. The hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded X antigen, HBx, contributes importantly to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma using multiple mechanisms. Experiments were designed to test if in addition to CDH1 hypermethylation HBx promotes epigenetic modulation of E-cadherin transcriptional activity through histone deacetylation and miR-373. The relationships between HBx, E-cadherin, mSin3A, Snail-1 and miR-373 were evaluated in HBx expressing (HepG2X) and control (HepG2CAT) cells by western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin IP as well as by immunohistochemical staining of liver and tumor tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. In HepG2X cells, decreased levels of E-cadherin and elevated levels of mSin3A and Snail-1 were detected. Reciprocal IP with anti-HBx and anti-mSin3A demonstrated mutual binding. Furthermore, HBx-mSin3A colocalization was detected by immunofluorescent staining. HBx downregulated E-cadherin expression by the recruitment of the mSin3A/histone deacetylase complex to the Snail-binding sites in human CDH1. Histone deacetylation inhibition by Trichostatin-A treatment restored E-cadherin expression. Mir-373, a positive regulator of E-cadherin expression, was downregulated by HBx in HepG2X cells and tissue sections from HBV-infected patients. Thus, histone deacetylation of CDH1 and downregulation of miR-373, together with the previously demonstrated hypermethylation of CDH1 by HBx, may be important for the understanding of HBV-related carcinogenesis."
7857,0.003,3.0,"Abacavir (1592U89) ((-)-(1S, 4R)-4-[2-amino-6-(cyclopropylamino)-9H-purin-9-yl]-2-cyclopentene- 1-m ethanol) is a 2'-deoxyguanosine analogue with potent activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1. To determine the metabolic profile, routes of elimination, and total recovery of abacavir and metabolites in humans, we undertook a phase I mass balance study in which six HIV-infected male volunteers ingested a single 600-mg oral dose of abacavir including 100 microCi of [(14)C]abacavir. The metabolic disposition of the drug was determined through analyses of whole-blood, plasma, urine, and stool samples, collected for a period of up to 10 days postdosing, and of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), collected up to 6 h postdosing. The radioactivity from abacavir and its two major metabolites, a 5'-carboxylate (2269W93) and a 5'-glucuronide (361W94), accounted for the majority (92%) of radioactivity detected in plasma. Virtually all of the administered dose of radioactivity (99%) was recovered, with 83% eliminated in urine and 16% eliminated in feces. Of the 83% radioactivity dose eliminated in the urine, 36% was identified as 361W94, 30% was identified as 2269W93, and 1.2% was identified as abacavir; the remaining 15.8% was attributed to numerous trace metabolites, of which <1% of the administered radioactivity was 1144U88, a minor metabolite. The peak concentration of abacavir in CSF ranged from 0.6 to 1.4 microg/ml, which is 8 to 20 times the mean 50% inhibitory concentration for HIV clinical isolates in vitro (0.07 microg/ml). In conclusion, the main route of elimination for oral abacavir in humans is metabolism, with <2% of a dose recovered in urine as unchanged drug. The main route of metabolite excretion is renal, with 83% of a dose recovered in urine. Two major metabolites, the 5'-carboxylate and the 5'-glucuronide, were identified in urine and, combined, accounted for 66% of the dose. Abacavir showed significant penetration into CSF."
1452,0.003,3.0,"In a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individual, immune-pressure-mediated positive selection operates to maintain the antigenic polymorphism on the gp120 third variable (V3) loop. Recently, we suggested on the basis of sequencing C2/V3 segments from an HIV-1 subtype E-infected family that a V3 sequence lineage group of the non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) variants (group 1) was relatively resistant to positive selection pressure (35). To better understand the relationship between the intensity of positive selection pressure and cell tropism of the virus, we determined the linkage between each V3 genotype and its function of directing coreceptor preference and MT2 cell tropism. The biological characterization of a panel of V3 recombinant viruses showed that all of the group 1 V3 sequences could confer an NSI/CCR5-using (NSI/R5) phenotype on HIV-1(LAI), whereas the group 2 V3 sequence, which was more positively charged than the group 1 sequence, dictated mainly a syncytium-inducing, CXCR4-using (SI/X4) phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis of C2/V3 sequences encoding group 1 or 2 V3 suggested that the variants carrying group 1 V3 are the ancestors of the intrafamilial infection and persisted in the family, while the variants carrying group 2 V3 evolved convergently from the group 1 V3 variants during disease progression in the individuals. Finally, a statistical test showed that the V3 sequence that could dictate an NSI/R5 phenotype had a synonymous substitution rate significantly higher than the nonsynonymous substitution rate. These data suggest that V3 sequences of the subtype E NSI/R5 variants are more resistant to positive selection pressure than those of the SI/X4 variants."
2315,0.003,3.0,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the hepatitis B core antigen could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in a small segment of 18 amino acids (codons 84-101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the five patients without mutations. These data suggest that the region with mutation clustering is the major target of CTL, and that the mutations evolve under the pressure of immune selection."
7786,0.003,3.0,"To provide additional information on the acquisition of host cell membrane proteins by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced by natural cellular reservoirs, two different field isolates were used to infect ex vivo expanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human lymphoid tissue histocultures. The insertion of host-derived HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CD40, CD40L, and CD86 within HIV-1 particles was evaluated by using specific antibodies linked to a solid matrix to capture ultrafiltrated viral progeny. Overall, our data indicate that neither the HIV-1 co-receptor usage (i.e., T-tropic or macrophage-tropic) nor the cellular source of HIV-1 has an impact on the incorporation process but it was found to be under the influence of the donor source. Given that most viral replication is thought to occur in lymphoid tissues and previous works have shown that HIV-1 life cycle is affected by several virus-anchored host proteins, our results suggest that this phenomenon is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of this retroviral infection."
2205,0.003,3.0,One hundred patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were investigated for serological markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and had liver function evaluated. One patient had hepatitis B surface antigen and 25 had antibodies to HBsAg which is not significantly different from normal blood donor controls. Minor liver function abnormalities were found in 35 patients and there was no difference between those with and without anti-HBs. A single patient without HBV markers had more severe liver enzyme elevation. Our data do not show a relationship between SLE and HBV and support the contention that liver diseases in lupus is mild.
1127,0.003,3.0,"The HIV epidemic in Vietnam is concentrated, with high prevalence estimates among injection drug users and commercial sex workers. Socio-demographics, substance use and clinical correlates of antiretroviral therapy non-adherence were studied in 100 HIV-1 infected drug users receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months in Hanoi, Vietnam. All study participants were men with a mean age of 29.9 ± 4.9 years. The median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 16.2 ± 12.7 months; 83% reported 'very good' or 'perfect' adherence in the past 30 days on a subjective one-item Likert scale at time of study enrollment; 48% of participants reported drug use within the previous 6 months, with 22% reporting current drug use. Injection drug use with or without non-injection drug use in the past 6 months (95% C.I. 2.19, 1.30-3.69) and years on antiretroviral therapy (95% C.I. 1.43, 1.14-1.78) were correlated with suboptimal adherence. These findings support Vietnam's ongoing scale-up of harm reduction programmes for injection drug users and their integration with antiretroviral therapy delivery. Moreover, results highlight the need to identify and implement new ways to support high levels of antiretroviral therapy adherence as duration on antiretroviral therapy increases. "
1423,0.003,3.0,"The safety and clinical impact of isoprinosine in HIV-infected individuals were assessed in a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 24-week study phase, followed by an optional 24-week open treatment phase. The results of the double-blind phase have been reported. Of 866 HIV-seropositive patients randomized, 832 subjects were eligible for efficacy analysis. On completion of the double-blind phase, 596 patients started open treatment. All patients were evaluated with regard to progression to AIDS and/or death. Within 48 weeks, 10/412 (2.4%) patients assigned isoprinosine and 27/420 (6.4%) patients assigned placebo progressed to AIDS (P = 0.005). Intention-to-treat analysis showed identical results. Viewing the open treatment phase in isolation revealed no difference in progression rates between those treated and those not receiving the drug, perhaps reflecting the higher proportion of patients receiving zidovudine or PCP prophylaxis in the latter group. No severe adverse reactions or toxicities were observed. We conclude that HIV-seropositive patients without AIDS may be safely and effectively treated with isoprinosine."
3284,0.003,3.0,"Improvements in HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been accompanied by increasing recognition of the importance of adherence to treatment regimens for maximizing patient benefits while minimizing the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Whether clinicians should screen patients for adherence and only administer therapy to those believed likely to adhere has not been resolved. We first examine the implications of data drawn from a recent study reporting physicians' ability to predict whether patients will adhere to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or not. We then extend previously developed mathematical models of ART to include screening for adherence and focus on resulting drug resistance as well as on HIV and AIDS incidence at the population level. We show that although screening for adherence is likely to reduce the level of drug resistance compared with a policy of treating all HIV patients with HAART, rates of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in the population would likely increase unless screening accuracy is extremely (perhaps implausibly) high."
2122,0.003,3.0,"Dexamethasone inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed gene expression in cells of T and B lymphoblastoid lineages, but not in monocytic cells. Suppression required an intact glucocorticoid receptor (GR), as it was amplified by transfection of lymphocytes with a plasmid encoding the human GR and blocked by the receptor antagonist RU486. These results were in direct contrast to the effects of dexamethasone on a murine leukemia retrovirus promoter where, consistent with the findings of others, activation of gene expression was obtained. Potential regions of the HIV-1 LTR mediating these effects were sought, with sequence homologies predicting two new glucocorticoid response element half-sites, GRE-II (nucleotides -6 to -1) and GRE-III (+ 15 to + 20), downstream from a previously identified GR DNA binding domain, GRE-I (-264 to -259). Mutational analyses documented the loss of inhibitory activity attendant on changes in GRE-III and the independence of steroid-mediated effects from GRE-I and GRE-II. Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a difference in binding of cellular factors to GRE-III in cells of T and B lymphocyte vs. monocytic lineages. Binding sites for the cellular transcription factor leader binding protein (LBP-1) were found to overlap with GRE-III, and LBP-1 interacted with this element in the HIV LTR only in T and B lymphocytic extracts. We hypothesize that GRE-III sequence-specific effects, including modulation of LBP-GR interactions, underlie the negative regulatory effect of glucocorticoids on HIV-1 gene expression, with some specificity for cell type."
8914,0.003,3.0,"Reports of an increased proportion of AIDS cases occurring in small and medium-sized cities suggest that the HIV epidemic may be spreading into locations that were previously characterized by their low HIV antibody prevalences. Studying the question of the geographic spread of the HIV infection epidemic (rather than the AIDS epidemic) has been difficult largely because most serial seroprevalence data have been gathered from cohorts of high risk individuals (e.g., homosexual/bisexual cohorts) in New York City, San Francisco, and other geographically circumscribed areas. The U.S. military applicant HIV screening data were used in the current report to examine rates and 24 month temporal trends in geographic areas characterized by their HIV endemicities. The data examined concern the seven most populous states and four hyperendemic metropolitan areas located within those states (New York City, Miami, Houston, and San Francisco). In the nonepidemic regions, seroprevalence rates increased among black and white applicants. In the four epidemic urban areas, only young black applicants had higher HIV seroprevalence rates during the second 12 month period. Six of the seven nonepidemic regions had positive HIV seroprevalence trends, and these trends were significant in Florida, California, Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. The increases in these regions were greater for young blacks (30% excess for year 2 vs. year 1) compared to young whites (12% excess for year 2 vs. year 1). These data provide evidence of birth year specific increases in seroprevalence over time occurring in presumed low HIV prevalence areas. These increases cannot be due to, but are observed in spite of, biases associated with increasing self-selection over time."
5333,0.003,3.0,"Viral blips, where HIV RNA plasma viral load (pVL) intermittently increases above the lower limit of assay detection, are a cause for concern. We investigated a number of hypotheses for their cause. We assessed HIV RNA, and total and episomal HIV DNA from 16 individuals commencing antiretroviral therapy (ART) consisting of raltegravir and tenofovir/emtricitabine for 3 years, using two assays: a single-copy assay [SCA; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), <1 copy/ml] and the Amplicor assay (LLOQ of 50 copies/ml). Two individuals exhibited viral blips. From week 20 onward, the period where ART had achieved its final suppressive levels, pVL ranged from <1 to 330 copies/ml, except for one individual at the final time. Both assays were 98% consistent (108/110) in assessing pVL <50 copies/ml, but the Amplicor assay registered 56% of samples (19/34) as below the LLOQ that were in the 50 to 1000 copy/ml range as quantified by SCA. pVL changes between successive time points did not correlate with changes in cellular infection as measured through either total or episomal HIV DNA. Changes in pVL were correlated (negatively) with changes in total CD4(+) T cell numbers (p=0.003), naive (CD45RO(-)CD62L(+)CD4(+)), natural regulatory (CD45RO(-)CD25(+)CD127(-)CD4(+)), activated effector (CD45RO(+)CD38(++)CCR5(+)CD8(+)), but not activated (CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)) CD4(+) T cells. Patients receiving stable, seemingly suppressive ART can have pVL near the 50 copy LLOQ at multiple time points. The high Amplicor assay error rate around this level implies that viral blips underrepresent pVL being more consistently above the LLOQ. Activation of latently infected cells is less likely to contribute to this phenomenon."
1953,0.003,3.0,"Infectious human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was recovered from two out of four bowel biopsy specimens from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with chronic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology. In-situ hybridisation of biopsy specimens from rectum and duodenum of other AIDS patients with gastrointestinal complaints showed the presence of HIV-infected cells in both the base of the bowel crypts and the lamina propria. The type(s) of epithelial cell(s) infected could not be determined definitively. However, the association of in-situ labelling of HIV RNA in argentaffin staining cells strongly suggests that enterochromaffin cells derived from neural crest tissue are among the target cells. This evidence that HIV can directly infect the bowel raises the possibility that the virus causes some of the gastrointestinal disorders of AIDS patients."

In this study, we examined several combinations of K-12 and other antiretroviral agents for their inhibitory effects on HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cell cultures. Combinations of K-12 and a reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, either zidovudine, lamivudine, or nevirapine, synergistically inhibited HIV-1 replication in acutely infected MT-4 cells. The combination of K-12 and the protease inhibitor nelfinavir (NFV) also synergistically inhibited HIV-1, whereas the synergism of this combination was weaker than that of the combinations with the RT inhibitors. K-12 did not enhance the cytotoxicities of RT and protease inhibitors. Synergism of the combinations was also observed in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The combination of K-12 and cepharanthine, a nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor, synergistically inhibited HIV-1 production in tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated U1 cells, a promonocytic cell line chronically infected with the virus. In contrast, additive inhibition was observed for the combination of K-12 and NFV. These results indicate that the combinations of K-12 and clinically available antiretroviral agents may have potential as chemotherapeutic modalities for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."
8456,0.003,3.0,"High rates of mutation and recombination help human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to evade the immune system and develop resistance to antiretroviral therapy. Macrophages and T-cells are the natural target cells of HIV-1 infection. A consensus has not been reached as to whether HIV replication results in differential recombination between primary T-cells and macrophages. Here, we used HIV with silent mutation markers along with next generation sequencing to compare the mutation and the recombination rates of HIV directly in T lymphocytes and macrophages. We observed a more than four-fold higher recombination rate of HIV in macrophages compared to T-cells (p < 0.001) and demonstrated that this difference is not due to different reliance on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptors between T-cells and macrophages. We also found that the pattern of recombination across the HIV genome (hot and cold spots) remains constant between T-cells and macrophages despite a three-fold increase in the overall recombination rate. This indicates that the difference in rates is a general feature of HIV DNA synthesis during macrophage infection. In contrast to HIV recombination, we found that T-cells have a 30% higher mutation rate than macrophages (p < 0.001) and that the mutational profile is similar between these cell types. Unexpectedly, we found no association between mutation and recombination in macrophages, in contrast to T-cells. Our data highlights some of the fundamental difference of HIV recombination and mutation amongst these two major target cells of infection. Understanding these differences will provide invaluable insights toward HIV evolution and how the virus evades immune surveillance and anti-retroviral therapeutics. "

4401,0.003,3.0,"The efficacy of protease inhibitor drugs in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment is limited by the selection and expansion of drug-resistant mutations. HCV replication is error-prone and genetic variability within the dominant epitopes ensures its persistence. The aims of this study are to evaluate the role of cellular immune response in the emergence of HCV protease resistance mutations and its effects on treatment outcome. Ten chronically HCV-infected subjects were treated with boceprevir (BOC)-based triple therapy. HCV-RNA was tested for BOC resistance-associated viral variants. HCV protease resistance mutations were investigated pretreatment and 24 weeks post-treatment. Synthetic peptides representing the wild-type and the potential nonstructural (NS)3 variants were used to evaluate T cell responses and human leukocyte antigen binding. Sustained viral response was achieved in 70% of patients, two patients were treatment nonresponders (NRs) and one was classified as a relapse. Pretreatment, the proportion of drug-resistant variants within individuals was higher in sustained viral responders (SVRs) than in NR patients. However, resistance-associated variants increased in NRs after BOC combined triple therapy. In contrast to NR patients, significant stronger cell-mediated immune responses were observed at the baseline among those who achieved sustained viral response for all T cell epitopes tested. Despite the increase in cell-mediated immune responses at week 24 in NRs, they failed to control the virus replication, leading to development of overt drug-resistant variants. Our data suggest that strong NS3-specific T cell immune responses at the baseline may predict a positive outcome of directly acting antiviral-based therapy, and the presence of pre-existent resistance mutations does not play a significant role in the outcome of anti-HCV combined therapy."
8603,0.003,3.0,"Treatment with lamivudine of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) results in a high rate of drug resistance, which is primarily associated with the rtM204I/V substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase domain. Here we show that the rtM204I/V substitution, although essential, is insufficient for establishing resistance against lamivudine. The analysis of 639 HBV whole-genome sequences obtained from 11 patients shows that rtM204I/V is independently acquired by more than one intra-host HBV variant, indicating the convergent nature of lamivudine resistance. The differential capacity of HBV variants to develop drug resistance suggests that fitness effects of drug-resistance mutations depend on the genetic structure of the HBV genome. An analysis of Bayesian networks that connect rtM204I/V to many sites of HBV proteins confirms that lamivudine resistance is a complex trait encoded by the entire HBV genome rather than by a single mutation. These findings have implications for public health and offer a more general framework for understanding drug resistance."

7696,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health concern. HBV causes chronic infection in patients and can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other severe liver diseases. Thus, understanding HBV-related pathogenesis is of particular importance for prevention and clinical intervention. HBV surface antigens are indispensable for HBV virion formation and are useful viral markers for diagnosis and clinical assessment. During chronic HBV infection, HBV genomes may acquire and accumulate mutations and deletions, leading to the expression of defective HBV surface antigens. These defective HBV surface antigens have been found to play important roles in the progression of HBV-associated liver diseases. In this review, we focus our discussion on the nature of defective HBV surface antigen mutations and their contribution to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis B. The relationship between defective surface antigens and occult HBV infection are also discussed."
9179,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed the kinetics of CD4 cells, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load, and autoantibodies in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with Graves' disease (GD) after immune restoration on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; retrospective study). Five patients (median age, 41 yr) were diagnosed with GD after 20 (range, 14-22) months on HAART on the basis of clinical and biological hyperthyroidism, diffuse hyperfixation of thyroid scan, and the presence of anti-TSH receptor (anti-TSHR) antibodies (Ab). GD was diagnosed several months after the plasma HIV ribonucleic acid load became undetectable, when the CD4+ cell count had risen from 14 (range, 0-62) to 340 (range, 163-460) x 10(6) cells/L. Antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-TSHRAb appeared 14 (range, 9-18) and 14 (range, 11-20) months after starting HAART and 12 (range, 6-15) and 11 (range, 9-17) months after the increase in CD4+ cells. In 3 patients, TPOAb preceded TSHRAb by 3-10 months. No other autoantibodies were detected. Thyroid antibodies were absent in a group of 55 HIV-1-positive patients with comparable response to HAART and no symptoms of hyperthyroidism (cross-sectional study). Thyroid-specific autoimmunity can occur upon immune restoration with HAART. Our observations suggest a relationship between thymus-dependent immune reconstitution after immunosuppression and autoimmunity and may provide insight into the pathophysiology of GD."
5114,0.003,3.0,"A wide range of pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Mycobacterium, Leishmania, and Helicobacter pylori, can interact with dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), expressed on DCs and a subset of B cells. More specifically, the interaction of the gp120 envelope protein of HIV-1 with DC-SIGN can facilitate the transfer of virus to CD4+ T lymphocytes in trans and enhance infection. We have previously demonstrated that a multimeric LeX component in human milk binds to DC-SIGN, preventing HIV-1 from interacting with this receptor. Biochemical analysis reveals that the compound is heat resistant, trypsin sensitive, and larger than 100 kDa, indicating a specific glycoprotein as the inhibitory compound. By testing human milk from three different mothers, we found the levels of DC-SIGN binding and viral inhibition to vary between samples. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization analysis, we identified bile salt-stimulated lipase (BSSL), a Lewis X (LeX)-containing glycoprotein found in human milk, to be the major variant protein between the samples. BSSL isolated from human milk bound to DC-SIGN and inhibited the transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Two BSSL isoforms isolated from the same human milk sample showed differences in DC-SIGN binding, illustrating that alterations in the BSSL forms explain the differences observed. These results indicate that variations in BSSL lead to alterations in LeX expression by the protein, which subsequently alters the DC-SIGN binding capacity and the inhibitory effect on HIV-1 transfer. Identifying the specific molecular interaction between the different forms may aid in the future design of antimicrobial agents."
3164,0.003,3.0,"System dynamics (SD) modeling belongs to the rapidly evolving, interdisciplinary field of system science research. This field adds value to more traditional health research by contributing to the design and testing of complex integrated models of change, to examine health system performance and patient outcomes. Using selected milestones in HIV care management to frame our simulation research, we created a SD model to examine three patient subgroups of women of color (WOC) represented in our multi-site cohort, classified by their health care seeking status at baseline. Asked to reflect on their circumstance 6 months prior to enrollment in the MSE cohort, 53% noted they were receiving some care (In Care, n = 341), 31% that they had been seeking care (Seeking Care, n = 201), and 16% that they were undecided about seeking care (i.e., answered that they may or may not look for care) for treatment of their HIV (May or May Not Seek Care, n = 103). Our SD model compared simulated patterns of patient retention over 24 months in relation to: (1) access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), (2) adherence to ART, and (3) viral suppression. Assessed patterns yielded insights about system capacities and constraints in the context of the SPNS initiative under evaluation."
1618,0.003,3.0,"In September 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new guidelines calling for routine, voluntary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing for all persons aged 13-64 years in health care settings. These guidelines were motivated, in part, by mounting evidence that the traditional approach of using risk factors to identify candidates for HIV testing is inadequate. Of the 1.0-1.2 million people in the United States thought to be infected with HIV, approximately 25% remain unaware of their infection, and nearly half of all infected patients develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome < or = 1 year after testing positive for HIV. Also contributing to the change in testing guidelines was recent evidence that routine HIV testing is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness analysis, a method of assessing health care interventions in terms of the value they confer, reports results in terms of the resources that are required for the intervention to produce an additional unit of change in health effectiveness; more economically efficient programs are those with lower cost-effectiveness ratios. This article reviews the methods and results of cost-effectiveness studies in the United States and articulates why routine, voluntary HIV testing is not only of crucial public health importance but also economically justified."
9304,0.003,3.0,"Since January 25, 1988, the Baltimore City Health Department has offered routine, confidential, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing to clients of the city's two sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. During the first 11 months of the program, testing was offered at 20,843 patient visits and was accepted at 15,181 (73%) of these; 612 (4%) individual clients had results that were positive for HIV. Four hundred thirty-seven (71%) seropositive clients returned for test results, post-test counseling, and further evaluation. Most HIV-infected clients were single, and black men accounted for 75% of seropositive individuals. HIV-infected women tended to be younger than infected men (7% of the female clients were adolescents). Although homosexual activity, intravenous drug use, and sex with a partner at risk were common risk factors for seropositive clients, after two interviews 17% of men and 38% of infected women did not report traditional risk factors for HIV infection. Most clients were asymptomatic or had generalized lymphadenopathy at the time of HIV diagnosis. Health care resources for these individuals were limited; 62% of men and 85% of women either had no health insurance or received public assistance. Routine, voluntary, confidential HIV counseling and testing is a practical, effective means to identify HIV-infected individuals among clients being treated at STD clinics. Identification of these individuals early in the course of infection provides opportunities to implement early follow-up and therapy, to counsel clients to help prevent further spread of infection, and to obtain useful information for projecting future health care needs and policy."
4032,0.003,3.0,"Entecavir (ETV) is a deoxyguanosine analog approved for use for the treatment of chronic infection with wild-type and lamivudine-resistant (LVDr) hepatitis B virus (HBV). In LVD-refractory patients, 1.0 mg ETV suppressed HBV DNA levels to below the level of detection by PCR (<300 copies/ml) in 21% and 34% of patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively. Prior studies showed that virologic rebound due to ETV resistance (ETVr) required preexisting LVDr HBV reverse transcriptase substitutions M204V and L180M plus additional changes at T184, S202, or M250. To monitor for resistance, available isolates from 192 ETV-treated patients were sequenced, with phenotyping performed for all isolates with all emerging substitutions, in addition to isolates from all patients experiencing virologic rebounds. The T184, S202, or M250 substitution was found in LVDr HBV at baseline in 6% of patients and emerged in isolates from another 11/187 (6%) and 12/151 (8%) ETV-treated patients by Weeks 48 and 96, respectively. However, use of a more sensitive PCR assay detected many of the emerging changes at baseline, suggesting that they originated during LVD therapy. Only a subset of the changes in ETVr isolates altered their susceptibilities, and virtually all isolates were significantly replication impaired in vitro. Consequently, only 2/187 (1%) patients experienced ETVr rebounds in year 1, with an additional 14/151 (9%) patients experiencing ETVr rebounds in year 2. Isolates from all 16 patients with rebounds were LVDr and harbored the T184 and/or S202 change. Seventeen other novel substitutions emerged during ETV therapy, but none reduced the susceptibility to ETV or resulted in a rebound. In summary, ETV was effective in LVD-refractory patients, with resistant sequences arising from a subset of patients harboring preexisting LVDr/ETVr variants and with approximately half of the patients experiencing a virologic rebound."
2062,0.003,3.0,"The role of the thymus in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear. We developed an assay to quantify the number of recent thymic emigrants in blood based on the detection of a major excisional DNA byproduct (termed alpha1 circle) of T cell receptor rearrangement. By studying 532 normal individuals, we found that alpha1 circle numbers in blood remain high for the first 10-15 yr of life, a sharp drop is seen in the late teen years, and a gradual decline occurs thereafter. Compared with age-matched uninfected control individuals, alpha1 circle numbers in HIV-1-infected adults were significantly reduced; however, there were many individuals with normal alpha1 circle numbers. In 74 individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, we found no appreciable effect on alpha1 circle numbers in those whose baseline values were already within the normal range, but significant increases were observed in those with a preexisting impairment. The increases in alpha1 circle numbers were, however, numerically insufficient to account for the rise in levels of naive T lymphocytes. Overall, it is difficult to invoke thymic regenerative failure as a generalized mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in HIV-1 infection, as alpha1 circle numbers are normal in a substantial subset of HIV-1-infected individuals."
1171,0.003,3.0,"Tenofovir is an acyclic nucleotide analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF), a bis-alkoxyester prodrug of tenofovir, is approved for the treatment of HIV and is currently being developed to treat chronic hepatitis B. In this report, we further characterize the in vitro activity of tenofovir against HBV as well as its metabolism in hepatic cells. We show that tenofovir is efficiently phosphorylated to tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) in both HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. TFV-DP has a long intracellular half-life (95 h) and is a potent and competitive inhibitor of HBV polymerase (Ki = 0.18 microM). Tenofovir has a 50% effective concentration of 1.1 microM against HBV in cell-based assays, and potency is improved > 50-fold by the addition of bis-isoproxil progroups. Tenofovir has previously demonstrated full activity against lamivudine-resistant HBV in vitro and clinically. Here we show that the major adefovir resistance mutation, rtN236T, confers three- to fourfold-reduced susceptibility to tenofovir in cell culture; the clinical significance of this susceptibility shift has not yet been determined. The rtA194T HBV polymerase mutation recently identified in tenofovir DF-treated HIV/HBV-coinfected patients did not confer in vitro resistance to tenofovir as a single mutation or in a lamivudine-resistant viral background. Overall, the antiviral and metabolic profile of tenofovir supports its development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B."
8878,0.003,3.0,"Defective regulatory components of the immune system seem to contribute to HIV disease progression. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was reported to restore malfunctioning immunologic regulatory components. To corroborate this hypothesis, we studied different dendritic-cell (DC) and T-cell subsets with regulatory phenotype in 41 clinically stable patients with hemophilia more than 25 years after infection with HIV and 10 years after initiation of HAART. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed normal DC1 and DC2 levels, increased CD8 peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) counts and T helper (Th) 2 proportions, and decreased Th1, CD3CD4CD127, and CD3CD8CD127 PBL proportions. High viral load was associated with high DC1, whereas high CD8 PBL counts were associated with low DC2. CD3CD4CD25Foxp3 (regulatory T [Treg] cell) and CD3CD8CD28Foxp3 PBL counts (suppressor T [Ts] cell) exhibited normal levels in patients with undetectable retroviral load, were increased in parallel to retroviral load, and were associated with low CD8 T lymphocytes and low CD19 B lymphocytes. Normal or even increased levels of DCs and normal or even increased levels of PBL with a Treg or Ts phenotype that coincide with viral load increases and CD8 T- and CD19 B-lymphocyte decreases suggest a functioning immunoregulatory system that reacts to HIV replication. Increased CD8 PBL counts imply immunocompetence. Increased CD8 PBL counts and normal or even upregulated immunoregulatory cells might stabilize our long-term HIV-infected patients with hemophilia clinically."

1113,0.003,3.0,"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with marked disturbance of metabolism affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. In the first decade of clinical experience of HIV, the primary clinical manifestation of such disturbed metabolism was wasting. Such wasting was often severe and contributed significantly to the morbidity and mortality of AIDS. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that in addition to the effects of altered intermediary metabolism, reduced food intake played a major role in the causation of AIDS-related wasting. More recently, potent anti-retroviral drugs have dramatically changed the clinical consequences of HIV infection. Wasting has become far less frequent among infected patients and occurs in only a small percentage of subjects on effective anti-retroviral therapy. However, a new constellation of metabolic syndromes has become apparent characterized by altered body fat distribution ('lipodystrophy'), lactic acidosis and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. The mechanistic basis for such syndromes is currently unclear, but is the subject of ongoing research."
6336,0.003,3.0,"Approximately 15-20% of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus will develop severe neurological disease. This may be due in part to virus-induced release of a number of putative neurotoxins. However, there is little information to predict which individuals will progress to dementia or the precise mechanisms that drive pathogenesis. In an effort to identify early markers of neurological disease progression we used an in vitro bioassay with rat cortical neurons to test for the presence of toxins in CSF from 40 HIV-infected humans with mild, minimal or no neurological disease. A subset of HIV-infected individuals was found to have significant toxic activity in CSF indicating that toxic factors may be circulating prior to the development of dementia. The toxicity was concentration dependent and due to a factor with a molecular mass of less than 30 kDa. Only a small proportion of the cell death appeared to be due to apoptosis. Neuronal toxicity was associated with a gradual accumulation of intracellular calcium in a subset of cortical neurons over a period of 1-2 h and in the absence of a significant acute response. Individuals with both high viral burden and high CSF toxicity were significantly more likely to have neurological symptoms. These initial analyses indicate that toxic factors are present in the CSF of HIV-infected patients that could serve as useful markers of neurological disease progression and provide insights into pathogenic mechanisms in vivo."

Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and RANTES (but not MCP-3), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, or interleukin-8 (IL-8) was higher in HAD. MCP-1 correlated with CSF viral load and severity of dementia, and it increased over time in patients who developed dementia."
909,0.003,3.0,"To determine the frequency of the parasitic pathogens in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in a developing world setting, 295 stool specimens were examined from 166 HIV-positive patients (49% with AIDS) at São José Hospital, Fortaleza, Brazil, from September 1990 to March 1992. Significantly more patients with diarrhea (85%) than without (66%) had AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) (P < .005). Of the potential parasitic causes of diarrhea, only Cryptosporidium parvum and microsporidia were significantly associated with diarrheal disease. Infections with C. parvum, but not microsporidia, were associated with the rainy season (P < .005). Thus, C. parvum and microsporidia are the most common intestinal parasites associated with diarrhea in an HIV-infected population in Brazil and are associated with advanced HIV disease. The association of C. parvum infections with the rainy season suggests that contaminated water may be important in its transmission; however, the source of human microsporidia requires further investigation."

2272,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) seroprevalence is highly diverse among human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected patients, ranging between 10% of HIV-1 infected homo-bisexuel men, to >92% in patients infected with HIV-1 who acquired HIV-1 through intravenous drug use. Thus, being HCV-free while having acquired HIV-1 via intravenous drug use is a rare situation. Claudin-1 is a protein involved in intracellular tight-junctions and has been identified as a major cellular co-receptor for HCV infection. Our objective was to determine whether Claudin-1 gene (CLDN1) mutations might be involved in natural resistance to HCV infection. We conducted a case-control study. All recruited patients acquired HIV-1 infection via intravenous drug use route before 1995. The case study patients remained free from HCV infection (negative anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA). The control study patients was co-infected with HCV (positive anti-HCV antibodies). Direct genomic sequencing of the CLDN1 gene coding region and adjacent intron/exons junctions was performed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A total of 138 Caucasian patients were enrolled. Twenty-two patients (cases) were free from HCV infection and 116 (controls) were co-infected with HCV. We found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) described previously with no significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In conclusion, despite being a major cellular co-receptor for HCV entry in vitro, we did not identify any specific substitution in CLDN1 gene coding region in our study patients highly exposed but resistant to HCV infection in vivo. Other cellular co-factors involved in HCV infection should be investigated in this highly-exposed intravenous drug users patients."
138,0.003,3.0,"Microsporidia are increasingly being recognised as important enteric pathogens in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aims of this study were to investigate the frequency of detection of microsporidia associated with diarrhoea in patients with advanced HIV disease in the north west of England, and to determine the species involved and their prevalence. During the period from April 1992 to the end of December 1995, chronic diarrhoea in 88 patients in the late stage of HIV disease was investigated. Duodenal biopsies, duodenal aspirates or jejunal biopsies were received from 38 patients, and stool samples from 63 patients, as part of the routine investigation of possible causes of diarrhoea in these patients. Biopsies and aspirates were examined by thin-section electron microscopy (EM), and stool samples were examined by epi-fluorescence microscopy after staining with Calcofluor. Putative stool positives were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. CD4-lymphocyte counts were available from all patients who provided samples. Nine out of 63 patients (14.3%) were found to be excreting microsporidial spores on stool examination. The species was confirmed as Enterocytozoon bieneusi. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 37 x 10(6)/L (normal range 517-1677 x 10(6)/L). Three out of 38 biopsy specimens (7.9%) were also found to be infected with this microsporidian. The mean CD4-lymphocyte count for this group was 72 x 10(6)/L. Encephalitozoon intestinalis was not found in any samples examined. The prevalence of microsporidial infection in AIDS patients in the north west of England appears to be similar to that of patients in London, but less than that reported in studies from other developed countries."

This was a retrospective and descriptive study which included 196 adults infected by HIV-1 and treated by a combination containing TDF/FTC/EFV during 29 months in the daily hospital of Bobo Dioulasso. The median duration of follow-up was 7 months IQR [5-14 month]. The median age was 37 years IQR [31-45].With the initiation of treatment ARV, the median of the index of body mass was of 19 IQR [17-22]. The median of the lymphocytes TCD4 was 201/μl IQR [74-298/μl]. During the follow-up, we reported 25 deaths (12.8%). HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load was undetectable in 91.9% of the patients (124/135) at six months of treatment. The majority of the adverse effects of the treatment were of a neurosensory nature (40.5%). The TDF/FTC/EFV combination showed a good effectiveness in the treatment of the infection with HIV-1 in the first intention just as a good clinical tolerance. "
1872,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV may have important economic benefits for patients and their households. We quantified the impact of HIV treatment on employment status among HIV patients in rural South Africa who were enrolled in a public-sector HIV treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. We linked clinical data from more than 2,000 patients in the treatment program with ten years of longitudinal socioeconomic data from a complete community-based population cohort of more than 30,000 adults residing in the clinical catchment area. We estimated the employment effects of HIV treatment in fixed-effects regressions. Four years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy, employment among HIV patients had recovered to about 90 percent of baseline rates observed in the same patients three to five years before they started treatment. Many patients initiated treatment early enough that they were able to avoid any loss of employment due to HIV. These results represent the first estimates of employment recovery among HIV patients in a general population, relative to the employment levels that these patients had prior to job-threatening HIV illness and the decision to seek care. There are large economic benefits to HIV treatment. For some patients, further gains could be obtained from initiating antiretroviral therapy earlier, prior to HIV-related job loss."

Children with TB were compared to a control group of children admitted for elective surgery. The control group was also compared to a recent census of the background population. The crude odds ratio for HIV infection was 8.6 (95 % CI 2.2-73). After adjustment for possible confounders in a multivariate regression model, the odds ratio for HIV infection in children with TB was found to be 12.7 (95% CI 2.9-55). Of several independent determinants of TB assessed in the study, this association was the strongest. Until HIV transmission has reached its peak, an increasing burden of dual infection among Ethiopian children is to be expected."

Twenty-nine patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B, who have received lamivudine for at least 1 year were studied to determine the antiviral response, the rate and pattern of lamivudine-resistant mutations, and the effect of lamivudine-resistant mutations on HBeAg status. The mean duration of treatment was 21 +/- 7 months. Before treatment, core promoter variant was detected in 16 (55%) patients and precore stop codon variant in 18 (62%) patients. Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA was detected by solution hybridization assay in 62%, 4%, and 24% and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in 100%, 31%, and 40% at months 0, 6, and 24, respectively. The cumulative rates of detection of lamivudine-resistant mutations after 1 and 2 years of treatment were 10% and 56%, respectively. In addition to the duration of treatment, core promoter mutation was associated with the selection of lamivudine-resistant mutants. Three patients with lamivudine-resistant mutations had reversion of the precore stop codon mutation; in 2 patients this was accompanied by the reappearance of HBeAg. We found that lamivudine-resistant mutants were detected at similar rates in patients with HBeAg-negative as in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. Additional changes in other parts of the HBV genome may restore the replication fitness of lamivudine-resistant mutants."
9681,0.003,3.0,"With the rapid progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the observed patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis has changed, allowing herpesvirus (HV) infection to be controlled. HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs--herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it."

Malnutrition represents another cause of acquired immunodeficiency and premature death. This evaluation program estimated the impact of family nutritional support during the first year of antiretroviral treatment in West Africa's sub-Sahara region. Family nutritional support was proposed to patients with CD-4 cell count <200 /mm3 and/or developing a WHO stage III/IV or with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 and receiving antiretroviral treatment. Follow-up of 62 patients receiving support was compared to 118 patients who had only received antiretroviral treatment the year before. Average body mass index, CD-4 cell count were 20.7 and 20.5, 217 and 191/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups (NS). Twenty-two (36%) and 56 (48%) were WHO stage III/IV (NS) respectively in supported and control groups. One patient who received support and twelve controls died (Mortality Ratio=0.19; p<0.05). Increase in CD-4 cell count was around 1.7 times higher (+ 114 vs. + 68 CD-4 cells/mm3 respectively in supported and control groups; p<0.05) and observance was improved in supported group (p<0.005). The evolutions of WHO stage and body mass index were not different but the study period was short. Family nutritional support for persons living with HIV initiating antiretroviral treatment in a developing country showed a positive impact after six months. This family intervention could be integrated into AIDS interventions as an effective and comprehensive community-based primary care."

This study evaluates whether there have been changes in the prevalence of infection by these virus over the last few years within a penitentiary. A group of prisoners (n = 163) studied in 1985 were therefore compared with another group (n = 750) studied in 1992. Demographic, social, risk and penitentiary factors were included. In each of the subjects studied alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B virus (HBsAG, antiHBs and antiHBc) and anti-HIV-1 markers were determined. It was globally observed that following the 7 years between the two studies there was a decrease in the prevalence of HBV (X = 14.63, p = 0.0001, OR = 2; CI 95%: 1.38-2.9), which was mainly observed in the group of prisoners with no drug addiction habits. No differences were observed with regard to the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 which remained similar among the IV drug consumers and not consumers (64% and 66.6% in 1985 and 1992, respectively). In conclusion, from 1985 to 1992 a decrease has been observed in the prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection in the penitentiary population while the prevalence of anti-HIV-1 has remained unchanged."
9428,0.003,3.0,"Human epithelial cells (L132) derived from embryonic lung and human lung fibroblasts (MRC5) were infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2 (HIV-2). Surface CD4 protein was detected on these cells, and recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) blocked infection, indicating that HIV infection was mediated by the cell surface CD4 protein. In contrast, infection of human primary chondrocyte cells (C23), synovial cells (HSA), and foreskin fibroblasts (F13) was apparently independent of cell CD4-mediated mechanisms. Surface CD4 protein could not be detected on these cells, and sCD4 did not block the infection. F13 cells could be infected only by HIV-2, not by HIV-1, under our experimental conditions. In cells of mesenchymal orgin, viral production could be detected only after cocultivation with the human T-lymphoid H9 cells but not by conventional viral assays, including reverse transcriptase and p24 antigen assays in cell culture supernatant and immunofluorescence of host cells. Our DNA transfection studies indicated that this lack of detectable viral production was not due to the inefficient use of the HIV long terminal repeat or the Tat protein in these cells. These mesenchymal and epithelial cells were susceptible to HIV infection but differed in mechanism of virus entry compared with hematopoietic cells such as T lymphocytes. These observations may provide insights into clinical syndromes such as lung dysfunction in HIV-infected newborns and connective tissue disorders in HIV-infected adults."

9061,0.003,3.0,"Evaluation of metabolic factors and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels as independent predictors of treatment failure in a thoroughly documented cohort of HIV-/HCV-coinfected patients (HIV/HCV). Sixty-four HIV/HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin (PEGIFN + RBV) at the Medical University of Vienna within a prospective trial were included in this study. In addition, 124 patients with HIV/HCV from the AIFA-HIV and AHIVCOS cohorts were included as a validation cohort. Advanced liver fibrosis, GGT elevation, insulin resistance (IR) and low CD4+ nadir were defined as METAVIR F3/F4, GGT levels >1.5× sex-specific upper limit of normal, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance >2 and CD4+ nadir <350 cells/μL, respectively. HCV-genotype 1/4 (OR26.3; P = 0.006), advanced liver fibrosis (OR20.2; P = 0.009), interleukin 28B rs12979860 non-C/C SNP (OR8.27; P = 0.02) and GGT elevation (OR7.97; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of treatment failure, while both IR (OR3.51; P = 0.106) and low CD4 + nadir (OR2.64; P = 0.263) were not independently associated with treatment failure. A statistically significant correlation between GGT elevation and prior alcohol abuse (r = 0.259; P = 0.039), liver steatosis (r = 0.301; P = 0.034) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (r = -0.256; P = 0.041) was observed. The importance of GGT elevation as an independent predictor of treatment failure was confirmed in a validation cohort (OR2.76; P = 0.026). While GGT elevation emerged as an independent predictor of treatment failure in both the derivation and the validation cohort, no independent associations between metabolic factors and treatment failure were observed. Thus, our findings suggest that GGT elevation is an independent predictor of treatment failure in HIV/HCV that can easily be incorporated into predictive algorithms. "
6783,0.003,3.0,"We used a standardized screening tool to examine frequency of depression and its relation to antiretroviral medication adherence among HIV-infected persons on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study). This is a prospective observational cohort of 700 HIV-infected patients enrolled between March 2004 and June 2006 in four U.S. cities, who completed a confidential audio computer-assisted self-interview [ACASI] with behavioral risk and health-related questions at baseline and 6-month follow-up visits, including the nine-question PRIME-MD depression screener and a validated 3-day antiretroviral adherence question. Among 539 eligible participants receiving HAART, 14% had depression at baseline (22% women, 12% men). In multivariable analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for repeated measurements through 24 months of follow-up, persons who reported depression on a given ACASI were twice as likely to report nonadherence to antiretrovirals on the same ACASI (Odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI: 1.15, 3.57] for mild/moderate depression versus none); such persons were also less likely to have HIV viral load<400 copies/mL. Self-administered computerized standardized screening tools can identify at-risk individuals with depression who may benefit from interventions to improve antiretroviral adherence."
9901,0.003,3.0,"An in vitro assay developed as a correlate of vaccine-induced protection from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was validated in populations with relative resistance to HIV-1 as well as in HIV vaccine recipients. Cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were challenged with 10 TCID50 of HIV-1MN or HIV-1BaL, titered in PBMC from normal controls (n=57). PBMC from HIV-1-infected persons with low viremia (n=17), exposed uninfected persons (n=23), and HIV-2-infected Senegalese prostitutes (n=9) were significantly resistant to HIV-1BaL and/or HIV-1MN (P<.001). Among 34 HIV vaccine recipients of live canarypox vector expressing multiple HIV-1 gene products with or without rgp120 booster, PBMC from postvaccination samples were significantly resistant to both strains (P<.001), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor-positive samples were significantly more resistant than were precursor-negative samples (P<.03). This is the first evidence of the induction by vaccination of a validated correlate of protection. This assay should serve as a useful criterion for assessing experimental HIV vaccines before phase III efficacy trials."
8907,0.003,3.0,"In the Mediterranean region almost all patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis are anti-HBV e antigen (anti-HBeAg)-positive and carriers of HBeAg-negative virus mutants. The six members of a family who acquired HBV infection were recently studied: two siblings developed cirrhosis with persistence of HBeAg positivity, whereas their parents and two more siblings cleared the virus. The two cirrhotic patients showed homozygosity for HLA class I by phenotype, which is a rare occurrence in the general population, while the other family members were heterozygous for HLA class I. The sequencing analyses of the entire viral DNAs isolated from both cirrhotic patients showed that the two viral genomes were almost identical and no mutation preventing HbeAg synthesis or viral gene expression was present. These findings might suggest that homozygosity for HLA class I molecules might be responsible for an insufficient response to the virus, favouring chronic outcome of the infection and the long-lasting persistence of HBV populations that produce HBeAg."
1645,0.003,3.0,"Repeated exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) does not always result in seroconversion. Modifications in coreceptors for HIV entrance to target cells are one of the factors that block the infection. We studied the frequency of Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene in Medellin, Colombia. Two hundred and eighteen individuals distributed in three different groups were analyzed for Delta-32 mutation in ccr5 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR): 29 HIV seropositive (SP), 39 exposed seronegative (ESN) and 150 individuals as a general population sample (GPS). The frequency of the Delta-32 mutant allele was 3.8% for ESN, 2.7% for GPS and 1.7% for SP. Only one homozygous mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32) was found among the ESN (2.6%). The heterozygous genotype (ccr5/Delta-32) was found in eight GPS (5.3%), in one SP (3.4%) and in one ESN (2.6%). The differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies among the three groups were not statistically significant. A comparison between the expected and the observed genotypic frequencies showed that these frequencies were significantly different for the ESN group, which indirectly suggests a protective effect of the mutant genotype (Delta-32/Delta-32). Since this mutant genotype explained the resistance of infection in only one of our ESN persons, different mechanisms of protection must be playing a more important role in this population."
644,0.003,3.0,"The nonstructural 5B (NS5B) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, monitoring of its naturally occurring mutations is very important for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. In the present study, mutations in the partial NS5B gene (492 bp) from 166 quasispecies of 15 genotype-1b (GT) treatment-naïve Korean chronic patients were determined and mutation patterns and frequencies mainly focusing on the T cell epitope regions were evaluated. The mutation frequency within the CD8+ T cell epitopes was significantly higher than those outside the CD8+ T cell epitopes. Of note, the mutation frequency within predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, a particular mutational hotspot in Korean patients was significantly higher than it was in patients from other areas, suggesting distinctive CD4+ T cell-mediated immune pressure against HCV infection in the Korean population. The mutation frequency in the NS5B region was positively correlated with patients with carrier-stage rather than progressive liver disease (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Furthermore, the mutation frequency in four codons (Q309, A333, V338 and Q355) known to be related to the sustained virological response (SVR) and end-of treatment response (ETR) was also significantly higher in Korean patients than in patients from other areas. In conclusion, a high degree of mutation frequency in the HCV GT-1b NS5B region, particularly in the predicted CD4+ T cell epitopes, was found in Korean patients, suggesting the presence of distinctive CD4+ T cell pressure in the Korean population. This provides a likely explanation of why relatively high levels of SVR after a combined therapy of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in Korean chronic patients with GT-1b infections are observed.

9724,0.003,3.0,"There is limited knowledge about how to treat and interpret results from genotypic resistance assays in HIV-2 infection. Here, genetic variation in HIV-2 pol gene was studied in 20 of 23 known HIV-2 cases in Sweden. Five patients with signs of virological treatment failure were longitudinally studied. Clinical, virological and immunological data were collected and the protease (PR) and first half of the reverse transcriptase (RT) was amplified and directly sequenced from plasma samples. Moderate to extensive genetic evolution was observed in four of the five patients who failed treatment. Some mutations occurred at positions known to confer resistance in HIV-1, but many occurred at other positions in PR and RT. All patients had been treated with zidovudine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, but none displayed a mutation at position 215, which is the primary zidovudine resistance site in HIV-1. Instead, a E219D mutation evolved in virus from two patients and a Q151M mutation evolved in two other patients. A M184V mutation indicative of lamivudine resistance was detected in three patients. The virus of one patient who had been treated with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and lopinavir successively acquired nine unusual mutations in the protease gene, most of which are not considered primary or secondary resistance mutations in HIV-1. Our data indicate that the evolutionary pathways that lead to antiretroviral resistance in HIV-2 and HIV-1 exhibit both similarities and differences. Genotypic HIV-2 resistance assays cannot be interpreted using algorithms developed for HIV-1, instead new algorithms specific for HIV-2 have to be developed."
208,0.003,3.0,"Anemia in HIV-infected individuals, still a common hematologic complication in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, is associated with shortened survival, increases in the rate of disease progression, and reduction in quality of life. Based on a thorough review of the literature, guidelines were developed for the assessment, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of anemia in patients with HIV/AIDS by a consensus committee consisting of nurses from academia and clinical practice. A major goal of this committee is to increase awareness within the nursing community of the prevalence of anemia in HIV-infected patients and its impact on their lives. Anemia developed in close to 90% of HIV-infected patients before the introduction of HAART, and it is still found in up to 46% of patients in the HAART era. Another goal is to encourage screening for anemia and the adaptation of a proposed classification system of anemia based on a graded decrease in hemoglobin levels."
279,0.003,3.0,"To assess the possible role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in containing the spread of human immunodeficiency virus in acutely infected individuals, the temporal evolution of the virus-specific CD8+ lymphocyte response was defined in simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac)-infected rhesus monkeys. A brief period of SIVmac plasma antigenemia was seen 9 to 16 days following intravenous infection with SIVmac, ending as the absolute number of CD8+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) increased. In a prospective assessment of the ability of CD8+ lymphocytes of these monkeys to suppress SIVmac replication in autologous PBLs, inhibitory activity was detected as early as 4 days, with a more pronounced effect 12 to 16 days following infection. SIVmac Gag- and Nef-specific CD8+ effector cell activities were demonstrable in PBLs of animals by 2 weeks following virus inoculation. In fact, SIVmac-specific CTL precursors were documented in the PBLs of rhesus monkeys 4 to 6 days after SIVmac infection. These studies indicate that AIDS virus-specific CD8+ CTLs are present in PBLs within days of infection and may play an important role in containing the early spread of virus."
1353,0.003,3.0,"A 29-year-old Ghanaian woman who developed AIDS while being HIV-antibody seronegative was investigated during a collaborative study aimed at the identification of viral causes of a HIV-seronegative AIDS syndrome in West Africa. Plasma was screened with a panel of EIA tests for antibodies to HIV and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Retroviral infection was investigated by detection of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in plasma, viral RNA amplification and quantification, and virus isolation. Positive amplification products were sequenced and phylogenetic analyses were carried out. Most EIA tests were unable to demonstrate the presence of anti-HIV anti-bodies, whereas confirmatory assays yielded inconclusive results. Retroviral infection was documented by detection of RT activity, HIV-1-specific genomic amplification and virus isolation. This virus was HIV-1 subtype A with an unusual six amino acid insertion in the gp120 V4 loop and with the nef gene of subtype G. The patient's plasma did not react with either autologous or heterologous viral lysates or HIV-1 peptides, whereas antibodies to other viral antigens were present. In conclusion, the Ghanaian patient exhibited a rare subtype A/G recombinant HIV-1 infection with a near absence of a HIV-specific humoral response. The lack of detectable antibody response might be due to either a highly pathogenic, rapidly fatal, HIV-1 infection preventing the development of the typical humoral immune response or to a host-related dysfunction of the immune system. Direct antigenemia or genomic detection of the virus should be undertaken when clinical or biological data suggests an HIV infection in the absence of serological evidence."
2436,0.003,3.0,"The Vif (virion infectivity factor protein of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) is essential for viral replication in vivo and productive infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and H9 T-cells. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of Vif remains unknown and needs to be further determined. In this report, we show that, like many other proteins encoded by HIV-1, Vif proteins possess a strong tendency toward self-association. In relatively native conditions, Vif proteins formed multimers in vitro, including dimers, trimers, or tetramers. Through in vivo binding assays such as coimmunoprecipitation and the mammalian two-hybrid system, we also demonstrated that Vif proteins could interact with each other within a cell, indicating that the multimerization of Vif proteins is not simply due to fortuitous aggregation. Further studies indicated that the domain affecting Vif self-association is located at the C terminus of this protein, especially the proline-enriched 151-164 region. Moreover, we found that a Vif mutant with deletion at amino acid 151-164 was unable to rescue the infectivity of vif-defective viruses generated from H9 T-cells, suggesting that the multimerization of Vif proteins could be important for Vif function in the viral life cycle. Our studies identified a new feature of Vif and should accelerate our understanding of its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis."
4394,0.003,3.0,"Serological detection of isolated anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can occur in various scenarios, but the most clinically relevant situation is occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of isolated anti-HBc and of OBI with isolated anti-HBc from an unselected hospital population. A total of 14,253 patients referred for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)/anti-HBs testing were classified into either the Health Promotion Center (HPC) group or the patient group. For patients who were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, an anti-HBc test was additionally performed. An HBV DNA real-time PCR test was performed on isolated anti-HBc patients, and their demographic and clinical data were reviewed. The measured prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI in isolated anti-HBc patients was 5.9 % and 4.7 %, respectively. Prevalence was higher in males, elderly people, and the patient group than in females, the younger, and the HPC group, respectively. In most cases, the levels of HBV DNA load were very low (less than 200 IU/mL), and most cases of OBI presented without liver disease or history of HBV infection. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc and OBI are affected by the methods of detection, subject population, and constituent factors such as sex and age. Although detection of HBV DNA does not always indicate infectivity, highly sensitive standardized HBV DNA tests are needed in clinical settings to exclude the possibility of OBI, especially in the advanced age group."

4759,0.003,3.0,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) and treatment engagement (TE) have been shown to significantly predict antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, but no studies have explored the ways and the extent to which similar outcomes might occur when these factors operate together, particularly for people who use drugs (PWUDs). We sought to discover whether TE moderated the effect of NCI on adherence to ART in HIV-infected individuals. One hundred sixteen HIV-infected, methadone-maintained people who reported HIV risk behaviors were enrolled in the study. Variables of interest (NCI, ART adherence, TE) were assessed using audio computer-assisted self-interview. Results revealed a significant interactive effect of NCI and TE on ART adherence, which supported the moderation effect. Findings from post hoc analyses showed that NCI was negatively associated with adherence to ART at low levels of TE. Findings suggest the need to accommodate individual NCI and improve TE as a means to enhance ART adherence in HIV-infected PWUDs."
3940,0.003,3.0,"Neuronal apoptosis within the central nervous system (CNS) is a characteristic feature of AIDS dementia, and it represents a common mechanism of neuronal death induced by neurotoxins (e.g., glutamate) released from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected macrophages (HIV/macrophage-induced neurotoxicity). Neuronal apoptosis may result from activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial/bcl-2 regulated) or extrinsic (death receptor) pathways, although which pathway predominates in CNS HIV infection is unknown. Apoptosis initiated by the intrinsic pathway is typically blocked by antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but whether these can block HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis is unknown. To determine the potential role of the Bcl-2 family in HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, we developed a unique in vitro model, utilizing the NT2 neuronal cell line, primary astrocytes and macrophages, and primary CNS HIV type 1 (HIV-1) isolates. We validated our model by demonstrating that NT2.N neurons are protected against HIV-infected macrophages by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists, similar to effects seen in primary neurons. We then established stable NT2.N neuronal lines that overexpress Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL, respectively) and determined their sensitivity to macrophages infected with primary R5, X4, and R5/X4 HIV-1 isolates. We found that NT2.N/bcl-2 and NT2.N/bcl-xL neurons were resistant to apoptosis induced by either R5, X4, or R5/X4 isolates and that resistance was abrogated by a Bcl-2 antagonist. Thus, the NMDA receptor/bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathway contributes significantly to HIV/macrophage-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl-2 family proteins protect neurons against the spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates. Modulation of bcl-2 gene expression may therefore offer adjunctive neuroprotection against development of AIDS dementia."
3054,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 gp120 is an immunoglobulin superantigen which can bind to preimmune serum Ig. We hypothesize that levels of such preimmune antibodies vary in the population and might affect host resistance or susceptibility to viral transmission. This study tests two predictions: (a) levels of preimmune anti-gpl20 Igs are a polymorphic trait; and, (b) these levels are correlated with resistance or susceptibility to HIV-1 transmission. The first prediction was confirmed in a longitudinal study of a low-risk seronegative population. In this group, levels of both endogenous anti-gpl20 IgM and IgG varied widely, but were characteristic and stable for each individual. The second prediction was addressed in a study of participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, in which men ""susceptible"" and ""resistant"" to HIV infection were identified based on numbers of sexual partners and eventual seroconversion. Specimens consisted of archival sera obtained > 2 yr before seroconversion. Men in the susceptible population (low-risk seroconverters) were distinguished by low levels of anti-gpl20 IgG. We conclude that the level of preimmune anti-gpl20 IgG is a polymorphic population trait, and low levels are a potentially specific and significant factor in homosexual transmission of HIV infection."

The study, from April 2003 to May 2005, with follow-up through 24 mo, was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Second Xiangya Hospital, Central-South University in Changsha, Hunan Province, China. Twenty-seven HIV1-infected patients received didanosine, stavudine, and nevirapine. Information from case notes regarding age, sex, side effects, viral load, naive and memory T cells, and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell count at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo was collected and analyzed. Virologic suppression, defined as an HIV RNA concentration of less than 50 copies/mL at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24, was considered the main outcome measure. Of 27 patients, 17 were men with a mean age 33.5 yr. The mean baseline viral load was 5.15 log copies/mL and the mean CD4(+) cell count was 185 cells/dL. Of 27 patients, 3 patients discontinued study medication; treatment was changed, because of side effects, from didanosine (ddI), stavudine (d4T), and nevirapine (NVP) to zidovudine, lamivudine, and NVP for 24 patients who had completed 24 mo of treatment with ddI, d4T, and NVP; and viral load suppression was attained in 17 patients (70.8%) at 12 mo, in 14 patients (58.3%) at 18 mo, and in 13 patients (56.6%) at 24 mo. The CD4 T cell count increased by 114 cells/microL (mean, 299 cells/microL) after 12 mo of treatment and by 132 cells/microL (mean, 317 cells/microL) after 24 mo of treatment. Naive T cells and memory cells also increased in number, but at a slower rate. Activated (CD38(+)) CD8(+) T cells were elevated at baseline (67.7%) and declined by month 24 (49.7%), but did not reach normal levels. We conclude that a regimen of NVP with ddI and d4T provided durable suppression of plasma viral load in HIV-infected patients, with significant improvement in the CD4 cell count, and can be well tolerated by patients with HIV-1 infection."
5072,0.003,3.0,"The Epstein-Barr virus immediate-early gene product BZLF1 transactivates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). The BZLF1 gene product caused an 18-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity from an HIV-1 LTR lacZ expression vector, whereas the HIV-1 transactivator tat caused a 44-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity. When cells were transfected with both BZLF1 (pEBV-Z) and tat (pTAT3) expression vectors, as well as HIV-1 LTR lacZ plasmid (pLRON), a 214-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity was observed. This result suggests a synergistic effect of BZLF1 and tat on HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression. Analysis of quantitative BZLF1 and tat requirements for maximal HIV-1 LTR activation indicates that BZLF1 does not reduce the amount of tat required for maximal LTR activation, as would be expected if the BZLF1 synergistic effect was due to increased tat gene expression. Thus, coordinate effects of BZLF1 and tat on the HIV-1 LTR or its transcript are probably responsible for synergistic HIV-1 LTR activation."

436,0.003,3.0,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring free radical with many functions. The oxidized form of NO, the nitrosonium ion, reacts with the thiol group of cysteine residues resulting in their modification to S-nitrosothiols. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease (HIV-PR) has two cysteine residues that are conserved amongst different viral isolates found in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In an active dimer, these residues are located near the surface of the protease. We have found that treatment of HIV-PR with different NO congeners results in loss of its proteolytic activity and simultaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols. Sodium nitroprusside inhibited HIV-PR up to 70% and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine completely inhibited the protease within 5 min of treatment. The pattern of inhibition by NO donors is comparable to its inhibition by N-acetyl pepstatin. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the modification of HIV-PR by NO as that of S-nitrosation. Our findings point towards a possible role of NO in mediating resistance to HIV-1 infection."
3791,0.003,3.0,"OBJECTIVE. To serially evaluate the viral kinetics of occult hepatitis B virus infection in lymphoma patients and perform a correlation with clinical outcomes. DESIGN. Case series with 1-year follow-up. SETTING. Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Consecutive patients who were newly diagnosed to have lymphoma in the hospital between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2008 were tested for hepatitis B (HB) surface (s) antigen (Ag), anti-HBs antibody (Ab) and anti-HB core (c) Ab. Seropositive occult hepatitis B patients as defined by being negative for HBsAg but positive anti-HBsAb and/or anti-HBcAb without a hepatitis B vaccination history were recruited. Serum HBsAg, anti-HBsAb, anti-HBcAb, hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) level, and liver biochemistry were checked at baseline and every 4 weeks during and after chemotherapy until 12 months after the completion of chemotherapy or death. Entecavir was started if patients developed biochemical flare-up of hepatitis B associated with virological rebound. The prevalence and course of hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis, as well as any temporal relationship to viral kinetics and clinical hepatitis, were assessed. RESULTS. Of 47 patients tested, 10 (21%) with lymphoma were seropositive occult hepatitis carriers. Their median baseline hepatitis B virus DNA level was 89 IU/mL (range, <34-807 IU/mL). Virological rebound (as defined by a 10-fold increase in serum hepatitis B virus DNA level from pre-chemotherapy level persisted for 4 weeks) occurred in one of the 10 patients, followed by biochemical reactivation. Whereupon entecavir treatment was started and no liver failure ensued. Regarding the other seropositive occult patients, their serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels fluctuated, but there was no associated biochemical reactivation. CONCLUSION. Detectable baseline serum hepatitis B virus DNA is not uncommon in patients with occult hepatitis B who receive chemotherapy. Transient elevation in serum hepatitis B virus DNA levels does not predict biochemical reactivation, but antiviral treatment might be considered if virological rebound persists."
555,0.003,3.0,"The KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa is experiencing an explosive outbreak of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype C infections. Understanding the genetic diversity of C viruses and the biological consequences of this diversity is important for the design of effective control strategies. We analyzed the protease gene, the first 935 nucleotides of reverse transcriptase, and the C2V5 envelope region of a representative set of 72 treatment-naïve patients from KwaZulu-Natal and correlated the results with amino acid signature and resistance patterns. Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple clusters or ""lineages"" of HIV-1 subtype C that segregated with other C viruses from southern Africa. The same pattern was observed for both black and Indian subgroups and for retrospective specimens collected prior to 1990, indicating that multiple sublineages of HIV-1 C have been present in KwaZulu-Natal since the early stages of the epidemic. With the exception of three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, no primary resistance mutations were identified. Numerous accessory polymorphisms were present in the protease, but none were located at drug-binding or active sites of the enzyme. One frequent polymorphism, I93L, was located near the protease/reverse transcriptase cleavage site. In the envelope, disruption of the glycosylation motif at the beginning of V3 was associated with the presence of an extra protein kinase C phosphorylation site at codon 11. Many polymorphisms were embedded within cytotoxic T lymphocyte or overlapping cytotoxic T-lymphocyte/T-helper epitopes, as defined for subtype B. This work forms a baseline for future studies aimed at understanding the impact of genetic diversity on vaccine efficacy and on natural susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs."

The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and prevalence of TB-HIV co-infection among patients admitted at Muhimbili National Hospital between August 2008 and July 2009 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Of 387 TB patients included, 117 (30.2%) were in the age group 30-39 years. The overall mean age of patients was 38.1 years (range 8 to 86 years) and 216 (55.8%) were male. Two hundred and five (53%) had pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 58 (15%) had extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and 124 (32%) had both PTB and EPTB. Common sites of EPTB were pleural cavity 80 (44%), lymph node 31 (17%) and 30 (16.5%) abdomen. Of the 300 TB patients tested for HIV, 175 (58.3%) were HIV-infected and 97 (55.4%) of these were already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at time of admission. Overall, 104 (26.9%) of the TB patients admitted died. About two thirds of patients who died had PTB. About three quarters (73.1%; N=283) of the patients were discharged home to continue with anti-TB treatment. There was significantly higher proportion of deaths among HIV-infected TB patients (29.1% versus 15.2%) than in the HIV uninfected TB patients (P=0.005). Age was a significant predictor for PTB (OR 0.946, 95% CI 0.917-0.976) while age (OR 1.019, 95% CI 1.002-1.036) and HIV serostatus (OR 2.143, 95% CI 1.313-3.497) were significant risk factors for EPTB. It is concluded that more than half of the patients had PTB and pleural cavity was the most common site of EPTB. TB-HIV co-infected patients had significantly higher mortality than the TB-HIV- uninfected patients. It is recommended to emphasize on the provision of HIV counselling and testing to all TB patients to ensure proper management and timely initiation of ART in TB-HIV co-infected patients in order to improve the outcome and reduce mortality."

6024,0.003,3.0,"The selection of escape mutations has a major impact on immune control of infections with viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Viral evasion of CD8(+) T-cell responses leaves predictable combinations of escape mutations, termed HLA ""footprints."" The most clearly defined footprints are those associated with HLA alleles that are linked with successful control of HIV, such as HLA-B*57. Here we investigated the extent to which HLA footprint sites in HIV type 1 (HIV-1) are associated with viral evolution among and within clades. First, we examined the extent to which amino acid differences between HIV-1 clades share identity with sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and observed a strong association, in particular with respect to sites of HLA-B selection (P < 10(-6)). Similarly, the sites of amino acid variability within a clade were found to overlap with sites of HLA-selected mutation. Second, we studied the impact of HLA selection on interclade phylogeny. Removing the sites of amino acid variability did not significantly affect clade-specific clustering, reflecting the central role of founder effects in establishing distinct clades. However, HLA footprints may underpin founder strains, and we show that amino acid substitutions between clades alter phylogeny, underlining a potentially substantial role for HLA in driving ongoing viral evolution. Finally, we investigated the impact of HLA selection on within-clade phylogeny and demonstrate that even a single HLA allele footprint can result in significant phylogenetic clustering of sequences. In conclusion, these data highlight the fact that HLA can be a strong selection force for both intra- and interclade HIV evolution at a population level."
6706,0.003,3.0,"The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) is not fully clarified. We investigated 18 men with HALS and 18 HIV-positive males without lipodystrophy (control subjects). Duration and modality of antiretroviral therapy were similar between study groups. A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp showed an impaired glucose disposal rate (GDR) in HALS patients (5.6 v 8.3 mg glucose/min. kg(FFM), P =.0006). As demonstrated by indirect calorimetry, HALS patients showed an impaired nonoxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM, 2.2 v 4.2, P =.006), whereas levels of basal and insulin-stimulated oxidative glucose metabolism (OGM) (2.4 v 2.3, P =.55, and 3.3 v 4.0, P =.064, respectively) were not significantly different between groups. Despite comparable total fat masses, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans showed that the percentage of limb fat (ie, peripheral-fat-mass/[peripheral-fat-mass + trunk-fat-mass]. 100%) was reduced in HALS patients (36% v 46%, P =.0002). Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that percentage of limb fat explained 53% of the variability of GDR and 45% of the variability of NOGM in HALS patients. In HALS patients, leg fat mass correlated positively with NOGM (r =.51, P <.05), whereas abdominal fat mass and NOGM did not correlate (P =.91). Analyzing the relationship between first phase insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, 6 HALS patients compared with none of the control subjects exhibited impaired insulin secretion (P <.05). Our data suggest that fat redistribution independently of antiretroviral therapy is highly related to insulin resistance in HALS patients. Furthermore, in HALS patients, impaired glucose metabolism most likely relates to decreased NOGM and to defects in beta-cell function."
7039,0.003,3.0,"Although perinatal transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well documented, seroprevalence rates of HIV in populations of women of reproductive age have not yet been reported. To determine the seroprevalence of HIV in childbearing women from a population with a high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cord blood samples were collected from 602 infants delivered at an inner-city municipal hospital in New York. Demographic and HIV risk factor information was also collected from mothers of these infants. Twelve (2%) of 602 samples (95% confidence interval, 1% to 4%) were positive for HIV on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis. In interviews, seven of 12 seropositive women had risk factors as defined by the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta; the remaining five seropositive women had no self-identified risk factors. The HIV seroprevalence rate in our hospital (2.0%) is several times higher than that of many other diseases for which screening is already routine. This serosurvey indicates that HIV infection of inner-city parturients is a significant problem that warrants broadly implemented health strategies. Furthermore, the data also suggest that if risk factor information elicited by physicians is used to initiate HIV antibody counseling and testing of pregnant women, a significant number of seropositive parturients is missed. In areas with significant seroprevalence rates of HIV infection, a broader counseling and testing program may be needed."
9810,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major global health problem. Recently, combination therapy including HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) has dramatically improved the long-term survival of HIV-infected patients. However, such therapy is associated with a lipodystrophy syndrome characterized by selective loss of sc fat from the face and extremities and, in some patients, accumulation of fat around the neck, dorsocervical region, abdomen, and trunk. Lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients (LDHIV) is associated with insulin resistance and its metabolic complications such as impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia and low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PIs appear to be the strongest link to LDHIV; however, fat loss has been reported in some patients taking non-PI antiretroviral drugs. Other factors, such as duration of HIV infection, age, and gender, may also contribute to the risk of development of LDHIV. The molecular basis of LDHIV remains unknown. There is no specific therapy for LDHIV. Avoiding weight gain by reducing energy intake and increasing physical activity may be beneficial in reducing fat accumulation as well as improving metabolic complications. Antihyperglycemic drugs may be used to treat diabetes. Management of dyslipidemia may require lipid-lowering drugs; however, the safety and efficacy of such intervention require further studies. Substitution of PIs with other antiretroviral drugs can mitigate dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance, but whether reversal of lipodystrophy occurs remains unknown. Future research is needed to discover the biochemical and molecular markers of lipodystrophy in HIV patients and develop PIs or other antiretroviral agents that are free of metabolic toxicity."
9124,0.003,3.0,"Nucleos(t)ide analog therapy blocks DNA synthesis by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase and can control the infection, but treatment is life-long and has high costs and unpredictable long-term side effects. The profound suppression of HBV by the nucleos(t)ide analogs and their ability to cure some patients indicates that they can push HBV to the brink of extinction. Consequently, more patients could be cured by suppressing HBV replication further using a new drug in combination with the nucleos(t)ide analogs. The HBV ribonuclease H (RNAseH) is a logical drug target because it is the second of only two viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication, but it has not been exploited, primarily because it is very difficult to produce active enzyme. To address this difficulty, we expressed HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs in E. coli and enriched the enzymes by nickel-affinity chromatography. HBV RNAseH activity in the enriched lysates was characterized in preparation for drug screening. Twenty-one candidate HBV RNAseH inhibitors were identified using chemical structure-activity analyses based on inhibitors of the HIV RNAseH and integrase. Twelve anti-RNAseH and anti-integrase compounds inhibited the HBV RNAseH at 10 µM, the best compounds had low micromolar IC(50) values against the RNAseH, and one compound inhibited HBV replication in tissue culture at 10 µM. Recombinant HBV genotype D RNAseH was more sensitive to inhibition than genotype H. This study demonstrates that recombinant HBV RNAseH suitable for low-throughput antiviral drug screening has been produced. The high percentage of compounds developed against the HIV RNAseH and integrase that were active against the HBV RNAseH indicates that the extensive drug design efforts against these HIV enzymes can guide anti-HBV RNAseH drug discovery. Finally, differential inhibition of HBV genotype D and H RNAseHs indicates that viral genetic variability will be a factor during drug development."
1334,0.003,3.0,"Little is known about factors involved in virological response to treatment changes guided by genotyping in patients whose highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) fails. A 12-month observational study was conducted of 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, who underwent a new genotype-guided HAART regimen following virological treatment failure. Logistic regression models were used to define factors predictive of virological response to genotype-assisted treatment switches. Virological response was defined as achievement of a level of plasma HIV-1 RNA <1000 copies/mL at the end of the follow-up. Drug-resistance mutations were detected at baseline in 30 patients (66.7%). A sustained virological response to new treatment occurred in 13 (43.3%) of these, as opposed to 11 (73.3%) of the 15 patients harboring drug-susceptible virus at baseline (P=.07). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the number of drug classes where there was resistance at baseline was the only independent predictor of virological failure (P=.0313). Lack of virological response to genotype-guided treatment changes is primarily due to complex baseline resistance patterns. Benefits of antiretroviral resistance testing may be seriously limited by the lack of subsequent treatment options for heavily pretreated patients."

8406,0.003,3.0,"Opportunistic infections (OIs) are common among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients; however, genetic susceptibility to these infections has not been studied. Recent studies have shown that interleukin-8 (IL-8) A/T genotype carriers are more susceptible to a variety of diseases. In this study, we showed the effects of IL-8 gene polymorphisms on OIs and symptoms such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), tuberculosis (TB), diarrhea, shortness of breath, weight loss, and viral load, in HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Genomic DNA was purified from mouthwash samples collected from patients attending HIV centers in the Vhembe district. The IL-8 (-251) A/T locus was genotyped using allele-specific polymerase chain reaction followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed a weak association between the IL-8 AA genotype and OIs such as STDs (P = 0.143), diarrhea (P = 0.906), and TB (P = 0.762). Significant associations were found between the IL-8 AT genotype and weight loss (P = 0.019), shortness of breath (P = 0.043), and skin problems (P = 0.003). Low viral load was also found to be significantly associated with IL-8 AA genotype (P = 0.009). The present study suggests that different IL-8 genotypes are associated with resistance to various OIs. However, further studies using larger samples sizes are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

184,0.003,3.0,"A total of 328 cases of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Western Australia in 1983-1987 was studied with respect to demographic factors, the risk profile, the clinical progression of disease, the utilization of inpatient services and trends in incidence over time. The crude incidence rates were 8.8 cases/100,000 person-years in men and 0.4 cases/100,000 person-years in women. Age-specific rates peaked at 25 to 29 years of age in men. The risk of HIV infection was associated with metropolitan residence, low socioeconomic level, and two specific occupational groups. Homosexual and bisexual men constituted 86% of all cases; the incidence rate of HIV infection in such men was approximately 1000-times higher than was the incidence rate by apparent sexual transmission in heterosexual persons. However, the proportion of cases that occurred in women or that apparently was caused by heterosexual sexual transmission increased from zero in 1983-1984 to 7.5% and 5.4%, respectively, in 1987. After two years of follow-up, 71% of preclinical (category-C) patients had developed signs, symptoms or evidence of immune dysfunction, and 12% of those patients with lymphadenopathy or with other early clinical features of disease (category-B) had progressed to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). At 21 months of follow-up, the survival rate with AIDS was 9%. Patients with AIDS utilized an average of 68.9 short-stay hospital bed-days per person-year, while category-B patients used 11.5 hospital bed-days per person-year. Notifications of HIV infection increased each year from 1983 to 1986, but fell by 22% in 1987. The latter may have been as a result of chance, a screening artefact or a real reduction in the incidence rate."
7208,0.003,3.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat protein has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. However, its role in modulating astroglial-neuronal relationships is poorly understood. Astrocyte infection with HIV has been associated with rapid progression of dementia. We thus initially transfected astrocytes with HIV proviral DNA and confirmed Tat production in these cells. Subsequently, using stably Tat-producing asytocyte cell lines, we observed that Tat promoted astrocyte survival by causing a prominent antioxidant effect and resistance to cell injury in these cells. Tat was released extracellularly where it could be taken up by other cells. Tat remained functionally active following uptake and caused long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation in lymphocytic and astrocytic cell lines. Tat released from astrocytes caused mitochondrial dysfunction, trimming of neurites, and cell death in neurons. Tat neurotoxicity was attenuated by anti-Tat antibodies, kynurenate or heparan sulfate. The neurotoxic effects of Tat were caused at concentrations lower than that needed to cause LTR transactivation. When Tat-expressing cells were injected into the rat dentate gyrus, Tat was taken up by granule cells and transported along neuronal pathways to the CA3 region where it caused glial cell activation and neurotoxicity. The arginine-rich domain of Tat was essential for both the LTR transactivation and the neurotoxic properties of Tat. Thus HIV-Tat is a potent neurotoxin that may act at distant sites while at the same time it assures its production by preventing cell death in astrocytes where it is produced."
5202,0.003,3.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor in the development of chronic hepatitis (CH) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The activation‑induced cytidine deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‑like (APOBEC) family of cytidine deaminases is significant in innate immunity, as it restricts numerous viruses, including HBV, through hypermutation‑dependent and ‑independent mechanisms. It is important to induce covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA degradation by interferon‑α without causing side effects in the infected host cell. Furthermore, organisms possess multiple mechanisms to regulate the expression of AID/APOBECs, control their enzymatic activity and restrict their access to DNA or RNA substrates. Therefore, the AID/APOBECs present promising targets for preventing and treating viral infections. In addition, gene polymorphisms of the AID/APOBEC family may alter host susceptibility to HBV acquisition and CH disease progression. Through G‑to‑A hypermutation, AID/APOBECs also edit HBV DNA and facilitate the mutation of HBV DNA, which may assist the virus to evolve and potentially escape from the immune responses. The AID/APOBEC family and their associated editing patterns may also exert oncogenic activity. Understanding the effects of cytidine deaminases in CH virus-induced hepatocarcinogenesis may aid with developing efficient prophylactic and therapeutic strategies against HCC."

To determine the prevalence of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including gonorrhoea, Chlamydia, herpes simplex type 2 and syphilis among FSWs. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 278 FSWs in Shiraz, by using respondent-driven sampling, from June to March 2010. The recruitment chain started with 14 seeds, and FSWs were tested for HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex type 2, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia.

3190,0.003,3.0,"This study aimed to determine the degree of clonal expansion of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients suffering from different clinical types of hepatitis B (HB) infection and to analyse the clinical relevance of the skewed T-cell receptor beta variable (TCRBV). Sera and PBMCs were collected from 90 HB patients. Gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) analysis was used to determine the distribution and expansion of populations expressing specific TCRBV complementary determined region 3 (CDR3) genes. TCRBV genes associated with monoclonal expansion were sequenced. TCRBV families from the majority of patients (80/90) displayed skewed T-cell expansion. Furthermore, TCRBV11, BV12 and BV13.1 were more frequent than other TCRBV genes; the sequence of TCRBV11 CDR3 was expressed as 'VYNEQ' in all patients and was accompanied by the BJ2.1 fragment. In patients with chronic HB, the frequency of skewed TCRBV was inversely correlated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels. The persistently skewed TCRBV gene families in HB patients may be associated with the development and maintenance of hepatitis. GMSP analysis of TCRBV gene families may be helpful in estimating disease status, and BV11 may be associated with HBV replication in patients with chronic HBV infection."

In 3 of the 28 patients (10.7%), the Q151M complex amino acid substitutions were identified. The three patients had received nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) monotherapy and/or combination regimens with multiple NRTIs for 4.3-8.6 years prior to the study. Recombinant infectious clones generated by incorporating the RT-encoding region of HIV-1 isolated from patients' plasma samples were highly resistant to zidovudine, didanosine and stavudine, while they were moderately resistant to lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). TDF-containing regimens reduced HIV-1 viremia in two of the three children carrying the Q151M complex. These data suggest that the Q151M could be prevalent in pediatric patients with long-term NRTI monotherapy and/or dual NRTI regimens and that HAART regimens containing TDF may be meritorious in such patients."

Among the 403 blood donors, 33 (8.2%), 21 (5.2%), and 27 (6.7%) tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HDV RNA, respectively. Collectively, 55 donors were viremic for one or more of these viruses, and included 54 first-time donors (18.7%) and 1 repeat donor (0.9%) (P < 0.0001). One discrepant case with HBsAg detectable only at MBC was negative for HBsAg, HBV DNA and anti-HBc in this study. Four donors who were HCV-viremic in this study were negative for anti-HCV by the MBC method. Further efforts to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the currently-used tests are urgently required in Mongolia. Three donors who were positive for anti-HBc and anti-HDV but negative for HBsAg, had both HBV DNA and HDV RNA. This suggests that introduction of a new anti-HDV serological test is useful for not only HDV screening but also HBV screening of anti-HBc-positive, HBsAg negative donors, considering a possibility of viral interference by coexisting HDV."

Most cases had acquired infection abroad through blood, blood products or sexual contact. The number of cases is continuously increasing. Fear and ignorance about HIV infection causes panic among health care workers (HCWs) whenever a case is discovered and needs medical care. We assessed the knowledge and attitude of 346 HCWs towards the probability of occupational HIV infection using a self administered questionnaire. The sample included physicians, surgeons, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance workers. 72.8% of HCWs believed that they are in ""great"" danger of acquiring AIDS through occupational exposure, whereas 0.6% thought that there was no danger. 67% of HCWs had wrong ideas about transmission of HIV (toilet seats, droplet infection, touching patients). 83.5% mentioned that AIDS patients should be isolated in quarantine. The main source of information about AIDS was the television, radio and ordinary press. 44.8% got their information from textbooks or scientific literature. 95.4% felt the need for more information about infection and disease. The results show an urgent need to start a program of education of HCWs concerning the risk of occupational HIV infection and the measures of its prevention."
7252,0.003,3.0,"Using an anonymous questionnaire to obtain baseline data on sexual behaviour and knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among students in university residences, the following information was obtained: Knowledge of AIDS was found to be high, although misconceptions regarding transmission of the virus were prevalent. Mosquito bites (15%) and the donating of blood (31%) were incorrectly identified as methods of transmission of the virus. Deep kissing was recognised by only 27% of the students as a possible method of transmission while 22% and 13% of the students, respectively, failed to identify the sharing of razor blades and blood transfusions as possible means of contracting HIV infection. The students' knowledge had not greatly affected sexual behaviour. Two-thirds of the respondents had previously had sexual contact; 38% were sexually active at the time of the study, and of these 74% had engaged in unprotected intercourse with casual partners in the previous 6 months. There was a negative attitude towards condom use and over 80% of sexually active students did not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting AIDS. Campus Health (82%), State health services (51%), and public advertisements (60%) were preferred sources of AIDS information. Newspapers/magazines (80%) and leaflets (69%) were identified as the preferred media. In reality, significantly fewer students obtained their information from Campus Health (15%; P less than 0.05), State health services (19%, P less than 0.05) and leaflets (44%; P less than 0.05).

Comparison of age-matched cohorts of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and -uninfected children from South Africa demonstrated an association between low CD4 cell counts, low interferon (IFN)-gamma production, and impaired ability to regulate growth of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin in blood from HIV-infected children.

This study investigated the prevalence and pattern of MHR mutations in North China and the clinical correlations of these mutations. The MHRs of 161 HBsAg-positive patients were amplified using nested PCR, and directly sequenced to identify MHR mutations. It was showed that among the 161 patients infected with HBV genotype C in North China, the overall frequency of MHR mutation was 46.6%. Furthermore, MHR mutations were associated with high white blood cell counts (P = 0.025), high bilirubin levels (P = 0.048), and cirrhosis (P = 0.010). The most frequent mutations in patients with both HBsAg-positive and anti-HBs-positive were located in subregion 1 and 3 of MHR, specifically, residue Q101 (29.9%) and I126 (70.6%), which was different from the mutation pattern found in Western Europe and the United States. Taken together, these data indicated important virological and clinical aspects of HBV evolution in terms of the surface gene of genotype C, which might be important for its response to the currently available HBV vaccine."

Despite calls to address childbearing for PLHA there has been limited attention to developing safe conception programs. This research sought to assess the childbearing desires of PLHA and the experiences of health care providers serving this population. Research entailed a brief cross-sectional client survey given to HIV-infected men and women over age 18 at two Los Angeles County clinics administered over an 8-week period. Focus group discussions were conducted with providers at each clinic site. Although 39% of the 93 clients surveyed reported a desire to have children, two-thirds of clients had not discussed their desires, or methods of safe conception, with providers. Providers reported challenges in providing safe conception services in resource poor settings where clients cannot afford assisted fertility services and in the absence of national, state, or county guidelines for safe conception. They noted complex and varied client circumstances and a critical need for provider training in safe conception. Guidelines that focus on safe conception and harm reduction strategies as well as the legal ramifications of counseling on these practices are needed. HIV providers need training and patients need educational tools and workshops informing them of the risks, challenges, and options available to them and their partners to safely conceive and bear an HIV-negative child."

We sought to determine whether a single acute bout of exercise, similar to what people experience when starting an intensive exercise program, has a detrimental effect on plasma HIV RNA levels. Twenty-five patients with HIV infection performed one 15-min bout of acute exercise. Absolute neutrophil counts, serum creatine phosphokinase, and 72-h urinary 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscle protein breakdown) were measured before and after the exercise, along with plasma HIV RNA levels. There were increases in neutrophil counts (P < 0.06), serum creatine phosphokinase (P < 0. 01), and urinary 3-methylhistidine (P < 0.01) in response to exercise, indicating a mild acute-phase response with muscle proteolysis. However, mean HIV RNA, which was elevated at baseline in 22 of the 25 subjects (mean of 4 x 10(5) +/- 0.7 x 10(5) copies/ml), did not increase during the week after exercise (P = 0. 12). Small changes in RNA were seen in the three subjects with initially undetectable HIV RNA, but the significance of these changes is unclear. Acute exercise does not have a deleterious effect on HIV replication in adults with high viral loads. Because regular exercise training has not been shown to activate the acute-phase response, the lack of increased viral loads in response to an acute exercise intervention suggests that exercise training is safe in people with HIV infection."

Early treatment results have suggested that lamivudine improves hepatic histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B, and can prevent recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation. It is likely that in the absence of immune clearance to accelerate elimination of infected hepatocytes, inhibitors of virus replication such as lamivudine will need to be administered for a long period to substantially reduce the burden of infected hepatocytes in the liver, and prevent relapse. Histological improvement has been noted in between 38% and 52% of lamivudine-treated patients, exceeding the improvement seen in placebo recipients. Lamivudine has also been assessed in anti-HBe positive, HBV DNA positive patients. Preliminary results show that 65% of lamivudine recipients become HBV DNA negative and have normal serum aminotransferases after a year of treatment. The drug is generally well tolerated with few direct adverse events. Genotypic mutations have been observed in 11% after 1 year of treatment, but this percentage doubles after 2 years of therapy. Loss of susceptibility lamivudine has been found to be due to reverse transcriptase amino acid substitutions. Lamivudine is likely to be reserved for patients with replicative hepatitis B infection with active chronic hepatitis, and/or active cirrhosis. Both HBeAg and anti-HBe positive patients are benefited, as may be patients with cirrhosis."
149,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has infected an estimated 170 million people worldwide, most of whom are chronically infected (60% to 80%). In Italy, the estimate of anti-HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence, in the general population of Northern Italy, is 3.2%; in Central and Southern Italy, it is 8.4% to 22.4%. Highest prevalence of infection (70% to 90%) is found among intravenous drug users. Our purpose is to monitor HCV infection among drug users treated in a Drug Addiction Centre (Ser.T) in Naples and to gain a better understanding of that relationship with the abused substance(s). Epidemiological data are shown for viral coinfections. Finally, the authors investigate access to specific HCV therapy in an Italian Ser.T. The study analyzed a group of 1753 consecutive subjects treated from 1988 to 2008 in the O.U. Ser.T D.S.31 (Gesù e Maria Hospital), ASL Napoli 1 Centre. HCV Abs were detected by enzyme immune assay method and confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay III method. During the entire period, we performed real-time polymerase chain reaction at random for 312 patients. The incidence (per year) of HCV infection showed a rapid spread decrease from 49.5% in 2003 to 14.5% in 2008. The overall prevalence of HCV was 48.1%. We tested 312 randomly selected patients for viral replication. Our study showed active viral replication in 201 (64.4%) patients as follows: 97 of 201 (31.1%) resulted infected by genotype (gt) 1; 3 of 201 (1.0%) gt 2; 84 of 201 (26.9%) gt 3; and 4 of 201 (1.3%) gt 4. Coinfection data showed that HCV Ab prevalence was 58.5% (48 of 82) in hepatitis B virus chronically infected patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV coinfection resulted in 95.2% (80 of 84) HIV patients. The prevalence of HIV Abs in HCV-infected patients was 8.99% (80 of 889). Analysis of drug abuse showed high prevalence of opiate addicted, multiabusers, and with high-risk factors. Cocaine abuser prevalence was 14.4%, and incidence, during past 4 years of the study, rose to 42.6%. Alcohol abuser prevalence represented 5.8% of patients and incidence rose to 17.7% in final 4 years of the study. In those opiate addicted, HCV infection was 61.0% (805 of 1320). HCV infection in cocaine-addicted patients was 9.5% (24 of 253). In 78 delta-9-tetra-hydro-cannabinol addicted patients, 5.1% of tests were positive (4 of 78). In alcohol abusers, HCV infection was 9.8% (10 of 102). Access to HCV treatment in our cohort from 2000 to 2008 resulted low (15.4%). Enhancing the Ser.Ts efficiency can result in health and financial benefits."
2321,0.003,3.0,"Pediatric HIV-1 infection presents remarkable features that are distinct from those observed in adult infection. In vertically HIV-1-infected children, the viral load declines more slowly, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response emerges late, only after the sixth month of life. This response generally tends to be narrow and less intense than that seen in adults. While the nuances of immune response at the cellular level during pediatric HIV-1 infection have been addressed, there is a lack of studies focusing on the consequences of this delayed and narrowed immune response at the population level. To better explore these features, we evaluated the selection regimen in gag, pol and env gene fragments of HIV-1 during pediatric infection. We estimated the number of nonsynonymous substitutions (d(N)) and synonymous substitutions (d(S)) codon-by-codon, using the maximum likelihood method and a modified counting method. Notably, both methods indicated a similar intensity of selection (measure by mean d(N)/d(S) ratio) between children and adults. Additionally, sites under positive selection were equally distributed along HIV genes and the location of these sites was analogous between children and adults. Therefore, the selective regimen in HIV during pediatric infection is equally broad and intense likewise the observed in adults. Unexpectedly, our phylogenetic-based analysis enabled us to identify two regions in the env gene of HIV with distinct adaptive functions. The first region, located in the vicinity of V3 loop, contains sites that might increase viral fitness within-host during antibody attack and virus-cell interaction. The second region, restricted to amino acids 334-368 of Gp160, contains sites that might increase viral fitness during interhost transmission at the population level."
1219,0.003,3.0,"Nonadherence with medical treatment is a critical threat to the health of those living with HIV disease. Unfortunately the search for explanatory factors for nonadherence is still not fully developed, particularly in the area of religion and spirituality. Extant literature suggests that church attendance, religious practices and spiritual beliefs may improve health and generally benefit patients. However, religious beliefs may also play a negative role in treatment adherence due to the stigma attached to HIV disease, particularly in geographical areas and in population subgroups where religious practices are strong. In this exploratory study, HIV-positive individuals (n = 306) in a southern state were surveyed as to their attitudes and beliefs surrounding HIV disease and adherence with medical treatment for the disease. The results indicate that multiple factors influence adherence with treatment and that certain religious practices are positively associated with adherence, but certain religious beliefs are negatively related to adherence. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of remembering and addressing a patient's religious beliefs as a part of medical care."

The purpose of the study was to explore knowledge, fears and follow-up care among Asian Americans chronically infected with hepatitis B. A sample of 154 completed an online survey which included demographic information, follow-up treatment information, and HBV knowledge and fears/concerns. Our findings indicate that there are differences by ethnicity and birthplace among Asian Americans in terms of follow-up care and treatment. In addition, our study indicates that there were substantial knowledge gaps regarding contracting HBV, transmission, and prevention. We found that HBV-infected respondents had many fears about their infection. Three primary concerns were identified: (a) concerns related to liver cancer and overall health, (b) transmission to loved ones, and (c) stigma. Our findings indicate that Asian Americans chronically infected with HBV need more education to manage HBV including information on the importance of follow-up treatment and care and education on preventing transmission, risk for liver cancer, and HBV impact on overall health.

In HIV-infected patients, the management of PAH is challenging given the potential drug interactions between PAH-specific vasodilators and antiretroviral drugs. We describe a 51-year-old female with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-associated PAH. She was treated with the oral endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan while taking a nevirapine (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor)-based antiretroviral regimen. Due to concerns about potential drug interactions with the antiretroviral therapy, her nevirapine plasma concentration, as well as CD4(+) cell count and viral load, were continuously monitored. We observed no interaction between bosentan and nevirapine during a 4-year period. To our knowledge, this report is the first to demonstrate successful, long-term coadministration of bosentan and a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor."
3587,0.003,3.0,"Quantitative serum antibody to p24 was evaluated as a predictor of risk of vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. HIV-positive mothers, 13 with HIV-infected children and 24 with noninfected children were investigated during pregnancy and at the time of delivery. A statistically significant difference in anti-p24 titers was found between the mothers with infected and those with noninfected children independent of whether antibodies were measured during pregnancy or at the time of delivery. High anti-p24 levels correlated with a low risk of vertical transmission, whereas low anti-p24 titers were associated with an increased risk of vertical transmission. Although the number of CD4+ T-cells was lower and neopterin and beta-2 microglobulin values were higher in the group of mothers with infected children than in the noninfected group, no statistical significance was achieved due to the small sample size."
7413,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection influences natural killer (NK) cell expression of inhibitory NK receptors and activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. It is unknown whether expression of the co-stimulatory NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) on NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells are affected by highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), low-level viraemia, proviral-DNA or immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients. A total of 101 HAART-treated HIV-1 infected patients with < or = 200 HIV-RNA copies/ml were followed prospectively for 24 months. HIV-RNA was investigated 3-monthly and 2B4 expression on CD3- CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells, proviral-DNA and plasma soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor (sTNFr)-II were investigated 6-monthly. For comparison, 2B4 expression was investigated in 20 healthy individuals. The concentration of 2B4+ NK cells was initially reduced in HIV-1 infected patients (P < 0.001) but increased to a normal level during the 24 months' follow-up. The concentration of CD3+ CD8+ 2B4+ cells in HIV-1 infected patients was normal and did not change during follow-up. The relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of 2B4 increased on both NK cells and CD3+ CD8+ cells during follow-up (both P < 0.001). Higher levels of proviral-DNA carrying cells and plasma sTNFrII were associated with reductions in the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells (all P < 0.05). HIV-RNA had no effect on 2B4 expression on NK cells or CD3+ CD8+ cells. These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells normalizes during long-term HAART in HIV-1 infected patients. The finding that proviral-DNA and sTNFrII were associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4+ NK cells suggests that immune activation in HIV-1 infected patients receiving HAART influences the target cell recognition by NK cells."
6270,0.003,3.0,"Immune complex formation causes underdetection of p24 antigen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Briefly boiling diluted plasma releases all complexed antigen, which can then be measured by some commercial assays. In a retrospective pediatric cohort study, the specificity of this procedure in 390 uninfected samples was 96.9% after initial testing and 100% after neutralization. Sensitivity among 125 postnatal infected samples was, at a detection of 2 pg/mL, 96.0% (97% neutralizable) compared with 47.7% for regular antigen (76% neutralizable), 96% for polymerase chain reaction, and 77% for viral culture. The high sensitivity and specificity of heat-denatured antigen was confirmed by prospectively testing 113 additional samples. Quantitative analysis of samples from infected infants showed low levels of p24 antigen in 29% of cord blood sera, a postnatal increase to levels that were during the first 6 months of life inversely associated with survival, and persistence of antigenemia thereafter independent of clinical status. Prevalence and antigen levels were significantly lower in mothers. The persistent antigenemia in children indicates that their immune systems cannot restrict HIV expression as efficiently as those of adults."

Among the patients listed in the registry, males outnumbered females by 4:1 (septicemia), 9:1 (multiple site infections), 5.6:1 (gastroenteritis), and 2.5:1 (urinary tract infection); among patients not listed, males outnumbered females by 2.7:1 (septicemia), 3:1 (multiple site infections), 1.2:1 (gastroenteritis), and 1.6:1 (urinary tract infection). These results strongly suggest that most nonlisted males with septicemia and multiple site infections, and a minority with gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection, were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive. Among individuals who were HIV-positive, or likely to be so, Salmonella enteritidis was more competent in causing septicemia and less competent in causing gastroenteritis than was Salmonella typhimurium; among HIV-negative individuals, the reverse was true. The different capacities for infection with and invasiveness of S. enteritidis, S. typhimurium, and other Salmonella serotypes in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals and the use of HIV testing for Salmonella-infected individuals are discussed."

8364,0.003,3.0,"Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections usually lead to death from AIDS, although the rate of the disease progression varies widely among individuals. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, which is restricted by highly polymorphic MHC class I alleles, plays a central role in controlling HIV replication. It is now recognized that the antiviral efficacy of CTLs at the single cell level is dependent on their antigen specificity and is important in determining the quality of host response to viruses so that the individual will remain asymptomatic. However, because of the extreme mutational plasticity of HIV, HIV-specific CTL responses are continuously and dynamically changing. In order to rationally design an effective vaccine, the questions as to what constitutes an effective antiviral CTL response and what characterizes a potent antigenic peptide to induce such responses are becoming highlighted as needing to be answered."

Sub-national estimates are not available for most jurisdictions. Hepatitis C surveillance data was adjusted for death, out-migration, under-diagnosis, and undetectable blood RNA, to estimate prevalence in New York City (NYC). The prevalence of hepatitis C infection in adults aged ⩾20 years in NYC is 2·37% (range 1·53-4·90%) or 146 500 cases of hepatitis C. This analysis presents a mechanism for generating prevalence estimates using local surveillance data accounting for biases and difficulty in accessing hard to reach populations. As the cohort of patients with hepatitis C age and require additional medical care, local public health officials will need a method to generate prevalence estimates to allocate resources. This approach can serve as a guideline for generating local estimates using surveillance data that is less resource prohibitive."

Mean age was 35.3 and 35.1 years, respectively. 156 individuals with a mean age of 28.3 years, confirmed as HIV-seronegative, served as controls. There were no significant differences in bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss among the HIV-seronegative individuals, HIV-seropositive and AIDS patients. We applied multiple logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for presence of periodontal conditions adjusting for age, gender and DMFT. Our odds ratios did not reveal any significant associations between bleeding on probing, pocket formation or attachment loss with regard to lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts among the HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients. When associations were investigated with regard to HIV-serostatus (HIV-seronegative, HIV-seropositive or AIDS), our adjusted odds ratios were insignificant, too. In fact, most odds ratios were close to 1. Thus, our study supports recent views that the presence, extent and severity of periodontal disease among HIV-infected individuals, may be less that hitherto thought."

The following four patterns emerged: (i) seropositivity for HIV with no immunologic abnormalities; (ii) seropositivity for HIV with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio; (iii) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio and T4-cell depletion; and (iv) seropositivity with a depressed T4/T8 cell ratio, T4-cell depletion, and lymphopenia. Ninety-two to 100% of subjects in each of the three groups of patients were found ""to scale"" because the abnormalities occurred in the cumulative, ordered fashion described. This nonrandom occurrence of abnormalities indicates an ordered progression of immunologic abnormalities in individuals infected with HIV, a finding useful in the staging of both symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive subjects."

As a result of similar modes of transmission, approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals are co-infected with HCV. Among intravenous drug users, almost 90% of people infected with HIV are also infected with HCV. Because of treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy, HIV-infected individuals have improved survival and are no longer suffering from opportunistic infections and malignancy as in years past. As a result, co-infection with HCV has now become a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, liver disease secondary to HCV infection is now the leading cause of hospital deaths in HIV-infected people in the US. HIV infection accelerates the course of HCV-related liver disease and viremia. It is less clear whether HCV infection affects the clinical course of HIV; however, HCV-related liver disease can limit many individuals from receiving anti-HIV therapy.

7144,0.003,3.0,"This article summarizes the current state of antiviral therapy of hepatitis B with special attention given to areas that remain controversial or poorly defined. Strict adherence to liver association practice guidelines may result in missed opportunities to treat patients with significant underlying liver disease. In particular, recommended ALT thresholds may not appropriately reflect disease activity or degree of fibrosis. There is growing evidence that an alternative treatment paradigm for preventing late-stage disease complications may be indicated in highly viremic patients with early life exposure to hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon therapy is often a better choice for young to middle-aged patients with genotype A and B because of the higher rate of HBeAg seroconversion and a greater chance for HBsAg seroconversion in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients as compared to nucleoside analogs. Nucleoside analog monotherapy is the current standard of care for many patients. However, long-term monotherapy results in resistance to a variable degree and sequential monotherapy may result in multi-drug resistant virus. Which patients would specifically benefit from early combination therapy also remains poorly defined. The rapidity and robustness of the suppression of HBV DNA while on a nucleoside analog should be monitored relatively early during treatment because it affects treatment outcome and the rate of resistance.

These 63 cases and 103 controls with negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology were studied in order to analyse the outbreak. The sources of infection were patients who were chronic HBsAg carriers. Infection was transmitted at the time of endomyocardial biopsy, if performed on the same day and in the same room after biopsy of an HBsAg positive patient.

This report updates and expands previous CDC guidelines for HBsAg testing and includes new recommendations for public health evaluation and management for chronically infected persons and their contacts. Routine testing for HBsAg now is recommended for additional populations with HBsAg prevalence of >/=2%: persons born in geographic regions with HBsAg prevalence of >/=2%, men who have sex with men, and injection-drug users.

The aim of the present study was to determine the clinical and laboratory profiles of HIV-infected individuals referred to a clinic for patients with special needs between 2005 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing their dental records. A total of 97 records of HIV patients referred to the School of Dentistry of Ribeirão Preto, Universidade de São Paulo - USP, were analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the associations between mean CD4+ counts, mean viral load, and the presence of HIV-related oral lesions (HIV-OL). Most of the patients were male, and their mean age was 38.3 years. Eighty-nine (92%) patients were on regular ART, 77 (79.4%) had a CD4+ count higher than 200 cells/mm3, and 63 (64.9%) had an undetectable viral load. Twenty patients (20.6%) presented with some HIV-OL, including pseudomembranous and/or erythematous candidiasis and angular cheilitis, which were correlated with a low CD4+ count and with an undetectable viral load (p < 0.05). Among the branches of dentistry, periodontics, followed by surgery and restorative dentistry, was the most sought-after specialty, and no intercurrent events were observed during the dental treatment. It may be concluded that there are no restrictions on the dental treatment of patients on regular ART, It is important, though, that the treatment be based on local characteristics and on the prevention of oral diseases.

1010,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes a persistent infection in humans and chimpanzees despite the presence of virus-specific, class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the liver. The data presented here demonstrate that CTLs directed against a conserved epitope in the HCV nonstructural 3 protein persist in the liver of a chronically infected chimpanzee for at least 2 years after infection. However, these CTLs did not recognize the HCV quasi-species present in the plasma of this animal at week 16 postinfection or at later time points. Escape from the CTL response was facilitated by an aspartic acid to glutamic acid (D-->E) substitution at amino acid position 1449 in all HCV genomes that were sequenced. The results of this study strongly support the concept that CTL responses can select for variant viruses with an enhanced ability to persist in a host and have important implications for the design of vaccines against HCV."
1927,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 circulates in vivo as a mixture of heterologous populations (quasispecies). We previously analyzed the quasispecies of the third hypervariable region (V3) in the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 in an infected individual and found that the species with a basic amino acid substitution (lysine for aspartic acid) at a particular position evolved and became a distinct population within a short period, followed by progression to the typical immunodeficiency stage (S. Oka et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 10:271-277, 1994). In the present study, we examined the biological significance of this amino acid substitution by constructing recombinant viruses with specific point mutations and comparing their replication capabilities in different cell types. The results demonstrated that the single basic amino acid substitution was sufficient to render a virus fully capable of replicating in human T-cell lines under certain conditions. With an acidic amino acid at the position, the virus grew much less fast or did not grow at all in the T-cell lines. Viral neutralization assay and peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays further showed that this amino acid substitution resulted in different recognition by several of the serum specimens from human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected individuals and thus could alter the antigenic structure. An additional finding worthy of note was that at the terminal stage, the proviral sequences of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the viral isolates from them were without exception of the late type with the basic amino acid substitution, whereas the early sequence without the substitution was retained as a major subset in the spleen. These results support the notion that basic amino acid substitutions in V3 are a strong predictor of virus tropism and may be relevant to disease progression."
2859,0.003,3.0,"Numerous studies now support that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing. In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope, with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells. Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary changes."

In the last few years, marked progress has been achieved in diagnostic methods, knowledge of the natural history of the disease and in therapeutic options, including liver transplantation, which has improved survival in these patients. These advances have been accompanied by an increase in the complexity of decision making. Six treatments have currently been approved for hepatitis B, including two interferon formulations--standard and pegylated--and four neucleos(t)ide analogs, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine, as well as two further drugs that are used in patients coinfected with HIV, tenofovir and emtricitabine. However, none of the current treatments is able to eradicate the virus and consequently prolonged treatments are often required with the consequent risk of generating resistance. For this reason, as well as the heterogeneity of the natural history of the disease, there is a lack of consensus on the indications for treatment and the parameters in which treatment should be based, the most suitable drug or drug combination, and the criteria to be used to continue, modify or suspend treatment.

Since the development of the viral load assay in 1988, assessment of HIV-1 plasma viraemia has become an integral part of HIV clinical care; however, the contemporary viral load assay was developed and optimized for clade B HIV-1. Here we report the underquantification of viraemia in an individual infected with clade A virus, and the consequent initial classification of the patient as an HIV controller (HIC). Immunological investigations of interferon (IFN)-γ and lymphoproliferative responses to HIV-1 clade B antigens and peptides, in parallel with mitogenic stimulation, were performed. Subsequent comparison with responses observed within clade B-infected HIC led to viral sequencing, confirmation of infecting clade and recommendation of antiretroviral therapy initiation. We emphasize the growing need for awareness of possible limitations of the commonly used viral load assays, which cannot be relied upon unreservedly in a clinical setting. Furthermore, this case highlights the increasing need for more detailed investigation into both viral genetics and fitness when defining patients as HIC."
608,0.003,3.0,"Studies of cultivatable human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples from infected patients have shown a correspondence between increasing viral burden and disease progression, but these measurements are selective and thus nonrepresentative of the in vivo viral load. Quantitation of proviral DNA sequences by the polymerase chain reaction in purified CD4+ T cells has shown a similar relationship but does not provide a measure of viral gene expression. We have studied viral DNA, genomic RNA, and spliced mRNA expression of HIV-1 in infected patients with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Viral RNA expression is detected in all stages of infection. These data show that the natural history of HIV infection is associated with a shift in the balance of viral expression favoring the production of genomic RNA without a preceding period of true viral latency."
820,0.003,3.0,"Mycophenolic acid (MPA) increases the activity of both abacavir (ABC) and didanosine (ddI) in vitro against wild-type and multinucleoside-resistant HIV. We treated 7 patients with diagnosed AIDS who did not respond to eight or more antiretroviral therapies in an open label pilot study with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), ABC, ddI, amprenavir (APV), and ritonavir (RTV), with or without efavirenz (EFV). Therapy was well tolerated despite the patients' advanced disease states. No significant decline in lymphocyte or other blood counts was observed. Median HIV RNA was 5.26 log10 copies/ml at entry, 4.53 log10 copies/ml at 4 weeks, and 5.13 log10 copies/ml at 16 weeks. Median CD4+ count was 34 cells/microl at entry and 39 cells/microl at 16 weeks of therapy. CD4+ counts increased further in five study subjects on extended therapy to 25 weeks (median 27 cells/microl at entry, 66 cells/microl at close), despite loss of virologic suppression in 4 of 5 cases. MPA can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes in vitro. However despite viral rebound, cell surface markers of apoptosis and activation declined in total CD3+ cells and CD3+/CD4+ cells twofold to fourfold in 4 of 5 adherent study subjects at 16 weeks, reaching levels comparable with those found in seronegative donors. Although low-dose MMF appears safe in late-stage HIV disease, this study did not demonstrate virologic efficacy. Higher doses of MMF may be more effective. With careful monitoring of toxicities and pharmacokinetics, MMF deserves further testing in HIV therapy."
2728,0.003,3.0,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are part of the cellular immune response to human persistent virus infections. Measurements of the frequency and specificity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific CTL and their variation with time may indicate their relative importance in modulating the progression of HIV-1 infection. We have used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to derive quantitative estimates of the frequency of HIV-1-specific CTL precursors in a cross-sectional study of 23 patients at different clinical stages of HIV-1 infection and to compare these with the frequency of CTL precursors specific for another persistent virus (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) in the same patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with autologous HIV-1-infected lymphoblasts and assayed for cytotoxicity in 51Cr release assays against autologous and MHC-mismatched lymphoblastoid B cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the three HIV-1 structural gene products. The frequency of MHC-restricted precursors was high in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (env-specific CTL precursors up to 73/10(6) PBMC; gag-specific CTL precursors up to 488/10(6) PBMC), although the relative frequency against the different structural gene products varied from patient to patient. The HIV-1-specific CTL precursor frequency was reduced in patients who had more severe (< 400/microliters) CD4+ lymphocyte depletion, while in the majority of such patients the frequency of CTL precursors against EBV was maintained at levels observed in healthy controls. Direct CTL activity in unstimulated PBMC was observed in three of nine patients but no correlation was found between the presence of an activated CTL response and the magnitude of the CTL response detected after stimulation in LDA. Thus, CTL precursors were detected against all three HIV-1 structural gene products in patients with CD4+ lymphocyte counts > 400/microliters, at frequencies that are high compared with those reported for other persistent viruses. A CTL response directed against multiple protein antigens of HIV-1 may protect the patient against epitope variation. The fact that the EBV-specific CTL precursor frequencies were maintained in advanced HIV-1 infection suggests that there may be selective impairment of the HIV-1-specific CTL response associated with disease progression."
1602,0.003,3.0,"The potential contribution of a plasmid DNA construct to vaccine-elicited protective immunity was explored in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/macaque model of AIDS. Making use of soluble major histocompatibility class I/peptide tetramers and peptide-specific killing assays to monitor CD8(+) T-lymphocyte responses to a dominant SIV Gag epitope in genetically selected rhesus monkeys, a codon-optimized SIV gag DNA vaccine construct was shown to elicit a high-frequency SIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. This CTL response was demonstrable in both peripheral blood and lymph node lymphocytes. Following an intravenous challenge with the highly pathogenic viral isolate SIVsm E660, these vaccinated monkeys developed a secondary CTL response that arose with more rapid kinetics and reached a higher frequency than did the postchallenge CTL response in control plasmid-vaccinated monkeys. While peak plasma SIV RNA levels were comparable in the experimentally and control-vaccinated monkeys during the period of primary infection, the gag plasmid DNA-vaccinated monkeys demonstrated better containment of viral replication by 50 days following SIV challenge. These findings indicate that a plasmid DNA vaccine can elicit SIV-specific CTL responses in rhesus monkeys, and this vaccine-elicited immunity can facilitate the generation of secondary CTL responses and control of viral replication following a pathogenic SIV challenge. These observations suggest that plasmid DNA may prove a useful component of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vaccine."

We reviewed the records of all 90 men discharged from the shelter psychiatry program to community housing over a 2-year period. HIV serostatus was recorded for 62 of the 90 men. Of these 62, 12 (19.4%) were positive. There were 28 men whose serostatus was not recorded. Data on the HIV risk behaviors of these 28 men suggested that seroprevalence could have been similarly high among them. The results indicate an urgent need to develop and apply preventive interventions for HIV in this population."

In India, studies during the 1990s showed highly variable anti-HDV prevalence rates among HBV-infected persons; however, data using molecular testing and recent data are not available. We therefore studied the prevalence of HDV infection in HBV-infected patients using tests for anti-HDV and HDV ribonucleic acid (RNA)."
8813,0.003,3.0,"A previous study revealed a high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA among 249 apparently healthy individuals (mean+/-standard deviation age, 48.4+/-13.9 years; 126 males and 123 females) in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. To investigate further the prevalence of HDV infection there, the same serum samples obtained from the cohort were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) by a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant hepatitis delta antigen protein expressed in the pupae of silkworm as the antigen probe. Anti-HDV was detected in 42 persons (16.9%), among whom 22 (52.4%) were positive for HBsAg and 20 (47.6%) had detectable HDV RNA. Among 170 persons with anti-HBc in the absence of HBsAg, 20 (11.8%) tested positive for anti-HDV, and 1 of the 20 subjects was positive for HDV RNA. Of note, none of 55 anti-HBc-negative persons had anti-HDV, supporting the specificity of the anti-HDV assay. The optical density (OD) value of anti-HDV was significantly higher among HDV RNA-positive subjects (n=21) than among HDV RNA-negative subjects (n=21) (2.513+/-0.514 vs. 0.836+/-0.550, P<0.0001). The present study confirmed the extremely high prevalence of HDV infection in Mongolia, and identified a person who was positive for both anti-HDV and HDV RNA despite negativity for HBsAg and HBV DNA probably due to viral interference. The anti-HDV assay may be useful for further epidemiological studies on HDV infection in larger cohorts in urban and rural areas of Mongolia, where elucidation of the transmission route of HDV is required urgently."
8427,0.003,3.0,"In Taiwan, injecting drug use has been the main route of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission since 2005, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) also having similar transmission routes. This has now become an important public health issue. The aim of this study is to explore the conditions of HDV infections between injecting drug users (IDUs) with and without HIV infection in Southern Taiwan. In this study, 87 IDUs were enrolled, including 27 anti-HDV seronegative IDUs and 60 anti-HDV seropositive IDUs, and the results of their liver function tests, CD4 cell counts, and anti-HIV and HIV RNA levels were analyzed. The prevalence of anti-HDV seropositivity among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive IDUs in this study was 68.9% (60/87). The prevalence rate of anti-HDV seropositive IDUs among anti-HIV seronegative and anti-HIV seropositive cases was 40.0% (12/30) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively. Anti-HIV seropositivity was related to anti-HDV seropositivity (odds ratio = 9.34, 95% confidence interval = 2.67-31.59, p < 0.001). Among IDUs with HIV infection, there was no significant difference in CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA viral load between HBsAg-positive patients with anti-HDV seronegativity and those with anti-HDV seropositivity. In conclusion, the prevalence of HDV infection among IDUs is higher among IDUs with HIV infection. Because anti-HIV seropositivity is significantly related to anti-HDV seropositivity, HDV infection among IDUs is still important. We suggest that for IDUs, HBsAg and anti-HDV should be monitored closely."

Overall, 69% reported having been vaccinated for HAV and 70% reported having been vaccinated for HBV. Multivariate models were used to identify predictors of HAV and HBV vaccination, and younger men, HIV-positive men, and men who had access to a doctor or clinic were more likely to be vaccinated than older men, HIV-negative men, and men without access to a doctor or clinic. Men with health insurance coverage were more likely to have received HBV vaccination than men without coverage. Findings indicate that there is still a significant proportion of unvaccinated men in our sample."
2147,0.003,3.0,"Considerable speculation and a recent publication has suggested that much of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in the subset of the UK population represented by women having babies in Metropolitan London is substantially imported from Africa. Other data are supportive of this hypothesis. Ades et al. (1992) concluded that the fraction of HIV seroprevalence, identified in a large London-based study using neonatal blood from the dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, attributable to mothers born in Africa was 92.4% with 95% CI: 82-100%. This is an important observation which requires confirmation. This paper reports on an attempt to do this with closely similar methodology using the Unlinked Anonymous Survey (UAS) of HIV-1 seroprevalence in pregnant women attending antenatal centres, together with data from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) on the country of origins of mothers delivering in 1991 at the 15 London centres included in the UAS. As in Ades' analysis there appeared to be a strong association between centre prevalences and the proportions of women of African origin delivering at those centres. This was consistent with a high fraction of seroprevalence attributable to such women, but it was also clear that the assumptions required for the estimation of the attributable fractions were not fully met. Analyses modified to justify the assumptions produced attributable fraction estimates ranging from 44% to 96% with lower 95% confidence limits 20% or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The ability of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services to increase medication adherence, improve health outcomes, and reduce overall medical costs has been demonstrated in community pharmacies for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. However, the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided MTM services in HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has not been well studied. In January 2005, a pilot program to evaluate MTM services for patients with HIV/AIDS began in California, allowing 10 HIV/AIDS specialty pharmacies to receive compensation for the MTM services that they provided to HIV/AIDS patients."
6186,0.003,3.0,"To examine the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among treatment-naive HIV/AIDS patients living in Liaoning province in China, the HIV-1 pol gene from plasma of 91 seropositive treatment-naive patients was amplified and sequenced. Three patients (3.3%) had an M46I amino acid substitution in the protease (PR) gene that decreased susceptibility to IDV, RTV, and NFV and one patient (1.1%) had an M184I amino acid substitution in the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene that confers high-level resistance to 3TC and FTC. Minor mutations were detected in high frequency in the PR gene. The frequencies of minor mutations to protease inhibitors (PI) were I93L (71.4%), L63P (62.6%), V77I (62.6%), M36I/V (33.0%), A71T/V (22.0%), K20R (6.6%), G16E (6.6%), and L10I (5.5%). The relatedness between subtypes and the frequencies of amino acid substitutions in PR were observed; 63P, 77I, and 71V/T were found in HIV-1 subtype B'/B, 16E, 36I, 20R/I, and 82I in non-B, except for CRF07_BC, 10I in subtype A, and 93L in non-A. Although the primary resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral drugs is low among the treatment-naive HIV-1 patients living in Liaoning province, the surveillance and monitoring of drug-resistant HIV-1 should be implemented regularly because of the increased access to antiretroviral therapy in China."
1155,0.003,3.0,"With about 350 million virus carriers, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health problem. HBV is a noncytopathic virus causing persistent infection, but it is still unknown whether host recognition of HBV may activate an innate immune response. We describe that upon infection of primary human liver cells, HBV is recognized by nonparenchymal cells of the liver, mainly by liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), although they are not infected. Within 3 hours, this recognition leads to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and subsequently to the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta), but does not induce an interferon response. The activation of proinflammatory cytokines, however, is transient, and even inhibits responsiveness toward a subsequent challenge. IL-6 released by Kupffer cells after activation of NF-kappaB controls HBV gene expression and replication in hepatocytes at the level of transcription shortly after infection. Upon binding to its receptor complex, IL-6 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases exogenous signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-jun N-terminal kinase, which inhibit expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1alpha and HNF 4alpha, two transcription factors essential for HBV gene expression and replication."
7129,0.003,3.0,"In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HIV-positive individuals are increasingly presenting with non-AIDS-defining cancers such as lung carcinoma. These neoplasms tend to exhibit aggressive clinical behavior and often present with metastatic disease. We present 2 cases of lung carcinoma that manifested initially with cutaneous metastases. Both patients were men (37 and 43 years old) with known AIDS that presented with multiple skin nodules mainly on the trunk (back and shoulder). These cases demonstrate that cutaneous metastases might represent the first sign of an internal HIV-related malignancy. Recognition of skin metastases is important for prompt diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy. With the growing problem of non-AIDS-defining cancers in the current era of HAART, clinicians should be aware that skin lesions in the HIV-infected individual might represent metastatic disease."
4570,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by HIV infection and replication in brain tissue. HIV-1-infected monocytes overexpress inflammatory molecules that facilitate their entry into the brain. Prostanoids are lipid mediators of inflammation that result from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity. Because COX-2 is normally induced during inflammatory processes, the aim of this study was to investigate whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated during monocyte-brain endothelium interactions. In vitro cocultures of HIV-infected macrophages and brain endothelium showed an up-regulation of COX-2 expression by both cell types. This up-regulation occurs via an interleukin-1beta (IL1beta)-dependent mechanism in macrophages and via an IL-1beta-independent mechanism in endothelial cells. Thus, interactions between HIV-infected monocytes and brain endothelium result in COX-2 expression and, as such, might contribute to the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection."

This study examined a new culturally targeted multi-component intervention to address emotional, attitudinal, and social/structural barriers to ART initiation and HIV care. Participants (N = 95) were African American/Black and Latino adults with CD4 < 500 cells/mm(3) not taking ART, randomized 1:1 to intervention or control arms, the latter receiving treatment as usual. Primary endpoints were adherence, evaluated via ART concentrations in hair samples, and HIV viral load suppression. The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Eight months post-baseline, intervention participants tended to be more likely to evidence ""good"" (that is, 7 days/week) adherence (60 vs. 26.7 %; p = 0.087; OR = 3.95), and had lower viral load levels than controls (t(22) = 2.29, p = 0.032; OR = 5.20), both large effect sizes. This highly promising intervention merits further study. "
5217,0.003,3.0,"Denmark is a country with low prevalence and incidence of blood borne viral infections. Among health care workers (HCWs) vaccination for hepatitis B is only offered to high-risk groups. The aims of this cross sectional survey were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, -C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among the staff at a Danish University hospital and to correlate this with risk factors for transmission. Additionally, we wanted to examine the current frequency of blood exposure, reporting habits and hepatitis B vaccination status in the staff. Of 1439 eligible hospital staffs included, 960 (67%) were HCWs. The overall human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-, hepatitis C Virus (HCV)- and hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-prevalence was 0% (0/1439), 0.14% (2/1439) and 1.6% (23/1439), respectively. Twenty-three percent of HCWs were vaccinated against HBV. Age, blood transfusion and stay in endemic areas were associated independently to HBV infection as opposed to job-category, duration of employment, HBV vaccination status and blood exposure. Based on a 4-week recall period, the incidence of percutaneous blood exposure was 1.5/person-year. In conclusion the HIV and hepatitis prevalence was low despite frequent blood exposure and the principal risk factors were unrelated to work. Danish HCWs do not seem to be at increased risk of hepatitis B even though universal HBV vaccination has not been implemented."

The sequences were inspected for resistance-associated mutations against PR and RT inhibitors. A total of 140 pol sequences were analyzed, of which 133 (95%) belong to HIV-1 subtype C, five (3.6%) were subtype B, and one each was subtype G and CRF02_AG. Five sequences (3.6%) had resistance-associated mutations. These include three (2.1%) NNRTI mutations.

A retrospective review of 300 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, revealed that 8% had prior zoster, a rate that is sevenfold greater than historic controls of the same age. We prospectively examined forty-eight patients, with no known immunodeficiency or signs of AIDS or AIDS related complex (ARC), who presented with zoster localized to the thoracic region. Forty-one patients had known risk factors for AIDS and thirty-five had antibody to the AIDS-associated virus (AAV) at the time of presentation. One seropositive subject had no known risk factors. Absolute lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios, and lymphocyte mitogen responses were all depressed in subjects with antibody to AAV when compared with seronegative individuals. Seven of thirty-three AAV antibody-positive subjects, who could be followed longitudinally, developed AIDS from 1 to 28 months (mean = 13) after zoster. One antibody-negative subject seroconverted to become AAV seropositive 16 months after zoster and developed Kaposi's sarcoma 1 month later. These eight subjects had persistently low lymphocyte OKT4/OKT8 ratios and elevated beta-2 microglobulin. In patients at risk for AIDS, the occurrence of zoster may be one sign that heralds the marked depression of cellular immunity associated with AIDS or ARC."
10002,0.003,3.0,"There is considerable interest in the potential of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to develop drug resistance, especially as 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (Retrovir) is now in widespread clinical use to treat people with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2.7.7.49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the recombinant mutant reverse transcriptase from a number of these constructs revealed enzymes that maintained enzyme activity but had a reduced ability to recognize inhibitors such as azidothymidine triphosphate. To assess the infectivity of these mutants, several constructs of proviral HIV clones with mutant reverse transcriptase genes have been made and used to transfect T cells. All five mutants tested have lower infectious potential, suggesting considerable levels of reverse transcriptase activity are required for efficient virus replication. Viable virus recovered from two clones showed decreased sensitivity to the antiviral compound phosphonoformate, thus demonstrating the potential for drug-resistant HIV to replicate. However, although the reverse transcriptase from these mutant viruses showed decreased sensitivity to azidothymidine triphosphate, paradoxically these viruses were hypersensitive to azidothymidine when tested in culture."
3158,0.003,3.0,"A case-control study was undertaken to determine risk factors for lactic acidosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients treated with nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). From May 1996 to June 2000, 9 patients with lactic acidosis (defined as a plasma lactic acid level of >5 mM and plasma pH of <7.38) were identified. Control patients were randomly selected from among a large cohort of patients who initiated a dual NRTI regimen in 1996 or after. Two factors were associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis: first, a creatinine clearance of <70 mL/min before lactic acidosis (OR, 15.8 [range, 3.0-86.5], P<10(-4)), and, second, a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count before the inception of NRTI therapy (OR, 8.4 [range, 1.2-infinity], P=.03). The total cumulative exposure to NRTIs was not associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, nor was the cumulative exposure to any of the 4 NRTIs studied. According to these results, monitoring of creatinine clearance, especially in patients with a low nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, could lead to modifications in antiretroviral therapy in order to diminish the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis."

HBV is a major health problem worldwide with more than 350 million individuals being chronically infected. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that replicates by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate. HBV genome is optimized, being circular and encoding four overlapping reading frames. Indeed, each nucleotide of the genome takes part in the coding of at least one protein. However, HBV shows some genome variability leading to at least eight different genotypes and recombinant forms. The main drugs used to treat infected patients are nucleos(t)ides analogs (reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Unfortunately, HBV mutants resistant to these drugs may be selected and be responsible for treatment failure. HBVdb contains a collection of computer-annotated sequences based on manually annotated reference genomes.

1215,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed the first 96 patients tested for HIV resistance to antiretroviral therapy in three Brazilian states. The HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) were sequenced by using the ABI ViroSeq system. The drugs previously used for each patient were recorded and correlated with the mutations found in the samples. Viral load (VL) and CD4 count were also recorded. Only one patient had the wild type sequence. The most prevalent mutations were: 184V (59%), 41L (47.9%), 63P (53%), 215Y (50%), 36I (46%), 10I (35%), 67N (42%), 77I (37%), 90M (36%) and 210W (33%). A positive correlation between the number of previously used ARVs and the number of mutations was observed (p<0.05). Associations between mutations and ARV drugs were identified at positions 69, 118, 184 and 215 with previous exposure to NRTI, mutations at positions 98, 100, 103, 181 and 190 with previous NNRTI use and at positions 10, 20, 30, 46, 53, 54, 71, 73, 82, 84, 88 and 90 with previous PI therapy (p<0.05). Previous exposure to ARV drugs was associated with previous genotypic resistance to specific drugs, leading to treatment failure in HIV patients. Genotypic resistance was clearly associated with virological and immunological failure."

From February 20 to March 20, 2009, 300 prisoners over 18 years of age held in Ouagadougou were selected to take part in this descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic data, confinement information (number, motive and prison time), medical history, substance addiction (alcohol, tobacco, drug), and the other risk behaviors (sexual relations, type of partners, sharing of toiletries or razor) were compiled for each prisoner. Serological tests were performed to detect anti-HIV antibodies, Hbs antigen, and anti-treponema antibody. In prisoners presenting signs of tuberculosis, BAAR detection was performed by direct examination of sputum. Men represented 95% of the study population. Median age was of 30.1 +/- 8.9 years (range, 18 and 63). The prevalences of HIV infection, Hbs antigen and positive syphilitic serology were 5%, 27.3% and 5.7% respectively. Four prisoners (1.3%) had bacillary pulmonary tuberculosis. Two prisoners reported homosexual intercourse and 44 reported drug abuse. Sharing of toiletries and razor blades was reported by 18.7% and 20% of the prisoners respectively. Immediate measures are needed reduce the spread of these infections in prisons in Africa."

Clinical and laboratory data indicated that the disease in patients with a recent concomitant HAV/HBV infection was not different from that in patients who had HAV infection superimposed on a chronic HBV carrier or that in age and sex matched patients presenting with an acute viral hepatitis A infection alone. Furthermore, the outcome of the disease was not affected by the HBeAg/anti-HBe status of the hepatitis B positive patient. All patients recovered completely and on follow-up none showed any signs of chronic liver disease. Simultaneous HAV/HBV infection, therefore, does not result in a more severe disease."
6027,0.003,3.0,"In patients co-infected with HIV-1 and GB virus C (GBV-C), the disappearance of GBV-C RNA has been associated with accelerated disease progression. We studied longitudinal GBV-C viral titres in 28 HIV-1/GVB-C co-infected individuals receiving HAART. During HAART, median GBV-C RNA titres increased from 95 to 6000 copies/ml (P < 0.001). In patients interrupting HAART, GBV-C-RNA titres decreased as HIV replication resumed. These findings further support the theory that GBV-C replication could depend on the dynamics of HIV progression."
2403,0.003,3.0,"Polymorphic products of HLA class I genes restrict cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to the constantly evolving spectrum of HIV-1 antigens. Accordingly, homozygosity at class I loci can reduce the repertoire for such HLA-dependent interactions, leading to accelerated disease progression. To test this hypothesis we studied subjects from two distinct HIV/AIDS cohorts: 140 Dutch homosexual men and 202 Rwandan heterosexual women followed up to 13 years from HIV-1 seroconversion. We performed intermediate- and selective high-resolution molecular typing at HLA class I (A, B, and C) and high-resolution typing at HLA class II DRB1 and DQB1. Homozygosity at the HLA-A or -B locus or both was found at increasingly high frequency among individuals with successively more rapid progression to late-stage HIV-1-related conditions. In the combined cohorts (n = 342) the odds ratio (OR) due to HLA-A or -B antigen homozygosity in rapid versus slow progressors was 3.8 (p = 0.003); for Dutch men alone the OR was 3.5 (p = 0.102), and for Rwandan women the OR was 4.1 (p = 0.009). In contrast, homozygous genotypes at either HLA-C, DRB1, or DQB1 alone, or DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, did not exert any deleterious effect on HIV-1 disease progression. These findings suggest strongly that diversity in addition to sequence specificity at HLA-A and -B loci can influence the rate of disease progression following HIV-1 infection."
8607,0.003,3.0,"A specific 32-nucleotide deletion mutant of the CCR5 gene (Accr5), the coreceptor gene for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), can effectively suppress the transmission and pathogenesis of the virus. Individuals homozygous for the delta ccr5 allele resist primary macrophage-tropic HIV-1 infection, despite multiple high-risk sexual exposures. This gene deletion is relatively common among Caucasians but uncommon among Africans, Asians, and South Americans. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology to determine the frequency of the delta ccr5 allele in a Taiwanese population with diverse health status and social backgrounds. Subjects included 24 HIV-1-infected persons in the northern and southern parts of Taiwan; 131 HIV-1 high-risk, licensed female sex workers in the northern part of the island (21% of whom were aborigines); and 187 unrelated, healthy, HIV-1-negative individuals in southern Taiwan. PCR with primers encompassing the entire CCR5 gene was used to explore possible deletions at regions other than the 32-nucleotide area in the female sex workers. No ccr5 deletions were detected, indicating that they are rare or absent in the Taiwanese population. This finding implies that delta ccr5 is not likely to be part of the defense against the spread of HIV-1-infection in Taiwanese."
9245,0.003,3.0,"Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus has been recognized as a cause of systemic illness in immunocompromised hosts, including relapsing bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Acquired resistance to quinolone therapy, while reported for a variety of bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, has not been previously documented for C. fetus. Two cases of quinolone-resistant C. fetus bacteremia were detected in HIV-infected patients. Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the C. fetus gyrA gene in the 2 resistant isolates demonstrated a G-to-T change that led to an Asp-to-Tyr amino acid substitution at a critical residue frequently associated with quinolone resistance. In addition, comparison of the pre- and posttreatment isolates from 1 patient documented outer membrane protein changes temporally linked with the development of resistance. Relapsing C. fetus infections in quinolone-treated HIV-infected patients may be associated with the acquisition of resistance to these agents, and this resistance may be multifactorial."
3755,0.003,3.0,"High HIV-1 plasma viral loads (PVLs) in sub-Saharan Africa, partly because of high rates of coinfection, may have been one of the drivers of the ""explosive"" epidemics seen in that region. Using a previously published framework of infectiousness and survival, we estimate the excess onward HIV-1 transmission events (secondary infections) resulting from coinfection-induced changes in PVL during asymptomatic HIV-1 infection. For every 100 HIV-infected people, each suffering 1 episode of tuberculosis infection, there are 4.9 (2.7th-97.5th percentile: 0.2-21.5) excess onward HIV-1 transmission events attributable to this coinfection. Other estimates are malaria 0.4 (0.0-2.0), soil-transmitted helminths 3.1 (0.1-14.9), schistosomiasis 8.5 (0.2-38.6), filariasis 13.3 (0.3-89.2), syphilis 0.1 (0.0-1.6), herpes simplex virus 4.0 (0.0-24.2), and gonorrhea 2.1 (0.1-8.0) transmissions. If these higher PVLs confer a shorter life expectancy and higher infectiousness, then their impact on transmission is, in general, reduced. For most HIV-1 coinfections, the duration of a single infection is too short and/or the associated PVL elevation is too modest to contribute substantially to onward HIV-1 transmission. "

Lipid disorders, including lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, remain the most commonly reported metabolic disorders among those treated with long-term cART. Mounting evidence suggests an association between drug abuse and poor glycemic control and diabetes complications. Substance related disorders (SRD) may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome."

3435,0.003,3.0,"The human cdc2-related kinase PITALRE is the catalytic component of TAK, the Tat-associated kinase. Previously, we have proposed that TAK is a cellular factor that mediates Tat transactivation function. Here we demonstrate that transient overexpression of PITALRE specifically squelches Tat-1 activation of both a transfected and an integrated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR), suggesting that PITALRE mediates Tat function as a multiprotein complex. A catalytic mutant of PITALRE, D167N, was found to be more efficient than wild-type PITALRE in squelching Tat transactivation. Neither wild-type PITALRE nor D167N was able to squelch transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia type 1 LTR by the Tax protein. Additionally, we show that artificial targeting of PITALRE to a nascent RNA element, in the absence of Tat, activated HIV-1 LTR expression. These results indicate that a PITALRE-containing complex mediates transactivation by Tat and suggest that Tat proteins function by localizing such a PITALRE-containing complex to the site of the transcribing provirus."
3697,0.003,3.0,"The aim of this study was the development of a panel constituted by well-defined HIV-1 strains of different genetic forms, with a particular focus on isolates from acute and recent infections. Fourteen HIV-1 isolates, including four from acute and five from recent infections, were expanded in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SI phenotype, coreceptors use, and TCID(50)/ml were determined. V3 net charge was calculated. Near full-length genomes were amplified by RT-nested PCR in four overlapping segments. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of cysteine residues, lengths of variable regions, and potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 was performed. Viral stocks were produced. Thirteen strains were NSI/R5 and one SI/R5,X4. TCID(50)/ml ranged between 10(4.6) and 10(6). V3 net charge was <+5 in 12 sequences and +5 in two sequences. Near full-length HIV-1 genomes analysis identified viruses of the following genetic forms: eight subtype B, three subtype C, two CRF02_AG, and one subtype G. Cysteine residues that form the V1,V2,V3, and V4 loops were highly conserved. The number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and gp41 ranged between 24-29 and 4-6, respectively. Seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites in gp120 and three in gp41 were conserved. V1, V2, V4, and V5 variable regions exhibited substantial length variation. In addition, an analysis of transmitted and natural resistance to current antiretroviral drugs in these strains was performed. It is worth mentioning that the 13S mutation in the V3 sequence, associated with resistance to maraviroc, was observed in a subtype B strain that harbored resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and to T20. The availability of a panel including strains from acute and recent infections should be a valuable resource for optimizing and standardizing vaccine candidate assessment. Near full-length genome characterization may be necessary for evaluating clade-specific reactivities."

The majority of patients had increased concentrations of soluble CD8, interferon-gamma and neopterin, and various significant correlations existed between them. Our results support the view that enhanced soluble CD8 levels indicate activated CD8+ T cells in patients with HIV infection."

The skin manifestations were diagnosed as leucocytoclastic vasculitis in view of both the clinical appearance and the histological findings. In this study, we demonstrated the presence of IgG-class anti-HCV-antibody, HCV-RNA and IgA-class rheumatoid factor in the cryoprecipitate. These results suggest that the cryoglobulinaemia in this case was caused by aggregation of an immune complex comprised of HCV and anti-HCV antibody with IgA-type-rheumatoid factor, and that this led to a cutaneous vasculitis."
1069,0.003,3.0,"The effects of proton pump inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir and amprenavir (administered as fosamprenavir) were rigorously evaluated in healthy volunteers in two studies, but formal studies in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are lacking. We describe a 65-year-old man with HIV who underwent a 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic study while receiving esomeprazole with atazanavir-ritonavir and subsequently, an 8-hour study while receiving esomeprazole with fosamprenavir-ritonavir. Consistent with the data in healthy volunteers, a major interaction between esomeprazole and atazanavir-ritonavir was observed in this patient-marked reductions in atazanavir trough plasma concentration and in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours-whereas an interaction between esomeprazole and fosamprenavir-ritonavir was not apparent in this patient."
7239,0.003,3.0,"We describe a 44-year-old male patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and pulmonary arterial hypertension who was treated with several protease inhibitors and with sildenafil. In order to guide treatment with sildenafil, the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of sildenafil were monitored at various time points. In comparison with healthy subjects, the maximal concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), and elimination half-life of sildenafil were approximately doubled in the patient. After increasing the sildenafil dose to ensure therapeutic drug levels over 24 hours, the pulmonary arterial hypertension and physical performance of the patient improved significantly. We conclude that the elimination of sildenafil is impaired in patients treated with protease inhibitors, but to a lesser extent than predicted from single-dose studies reported in the literature. Patients treated concomitantly with protease inhibitors and sildenafil need close monitoring of plasma levels, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of sildenafil in order to be treated optimally."
5218,0.003,3.0,"Liver transplantation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive patients has been associated with high morbidity and mortality secondary to hepatitis B (HB) recurrence in the graft. Eight patients of the Queensland Liver Transplant Service were HBsAg positive pretransplant. Six acquired HB infection of the graft, one developed serological recurrence of HB before early death from sepsis, and one HB e antigen-negative patient permanently cleared the virus. HB-infected grafts showed early expression of viral antigen, acute hepatitis, fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or minimal changes associated with a carrier state. Only in the latter case was HB mild and nonprogressive. Cases of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis progressed rapidly to liver failure; they showed fibrosis and plates of ductular epithelium extending from portal tracts into lobules, cholestasis, ballooning of hepatocytes, and prominent hepatocyte expression of viral antigens. Perioperative HB immunoglobulin proved ineffective in preventing HB recurrence. One other patient became HBsAg positive for the first time after retransplantation; he developed severe acute hepatitis, then chronic active hepatitis. Our biopsy findings support the view that, in liver allografts, the HB virus may be directly cytopathic."
4194,0.003,3.0,"Rare human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected individuals, termed elite suppressors (ES), maintain plasma virus levels of <50 copies/ml and normal CD4 counts without therapy. The major histocompatibility complex class I allele group human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*57 is overrepresented in this population. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes have been observed in ES, but their significance has remained unclear. Here we investigate the extent and impact of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations in HLA-B*57+ ES. We provide the first direct evidence that most ES experience chronic low level viremia. Sequencing revealed a striking discordance between the genotypes of plasma virus and archived provirus in resting CD4+ T cells. Mutations in HLA-B*57-restricted Gag epitopes were present in all viruses from plasma but were rare in proviruses, suggesting powerful selective pressure acting at these epitopes. Surprisingly, strong CD8+ T cell interferon-gamma responses were detected against some mutant epitopes found in plasma virus, suggesting the development of de novo responses to viral variants. In some individuals, relative CD8+ T cell interleukin-2 responses showed better correlation with the selection observed in vivo. Thus, analysis of low level viremia reveals an unexpectedly high level of CTL escape mutations reflecting selective pressure acting at HLA-B*57-restricted epitopes in ES. Continued viral suppression probably reflects CTL responses against unmutated epitopes and residual or de novo responses against epitopes with escape mutations."
4569,0.003,3.0,"CD4-positive membrane vesicles (MV) were isolated under isotonic conditions from human T lymphoblastoid cells MT-2 and CEM and tested for their ability to support reverse transcription of viral RNA upon exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). MV contained cytoplasms as confirmed by the presence of mitochondrial DNA but were devoid of chromosomal DNA. Virus binding and vesicle lysis assays revealed that 4-19% (depending upon virus dose) of MV-bound HIV-1 entered the vesicles. HIV-1 internalized in MV was able to initiate and complete viral DNA synthesis as determined by the detection of products of reverse transcription using polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral DNA using regions present in early (strong stop) transcripts and full-length double-stranded molecules. Viral DNA was undetectable in MV exposed to HIV-1 at 0 degrees C, in MV exposed to UV-inactivated virus at 37 degrees C, or after exposure to intact virus at 37 degrees C in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors 2',3'-dideoxycytidine and a tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk](1,4)-benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-thione derivative, indicating that viral DNA detected in HIV-1-exposed MV was synthesized de novo. Kinetic studies revealed that HIV-1 DNA synthesis in MV was very rapid; full-length viral DNA was detected within 15 min of exposure at 37 degrees C, and the DNA levels increased 90-fold after 1 h and declined thereafter. Strong stop viral DNA was 10-fold more abundant than full-length DNA after 1 h at 37 degrees C, indicating that 10% of input viral genomes are fully transcribed in MV within this time frame. This system preserves the critical features of intact CD4-bearing cells to permit studies of HIV-1 entry, uncoating, and reverse transcription of viral RNA."

In this article, the authors provide a brief overview of the most common psychiatric complications associated with HIV infection and discuss the role of dopamine as a link between psychiatric manifestations and the progression of immunodeficiency infection."
572,0.003,3.0,"Virus variants escaping from host immunity may be implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this cross-sectional study, the association was evaluated of the frequency of amino acid variation within the immunogenic epitopes of surface gene with different disease stages of chronic HBV infection. The surface gene of HBV encompassing the a determinant (amino acids 124-148) and the putative HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope (amino acids 28- 51) were amplified and directly sequenced in 33 asymptomatic carriers (Group I), 31 patients with chronic hepatitis (Group II), 22 with cirrhosis (Group III), and 36 with hepatocellular carcinoma (Group IV). The amino acid sequences were compared subsequently with the consensus sequences of HBV serotype adw or adr. The frequency of amino acid variation per site per sequence (FEQ) was analyzed by generalized estimating equation with Poisson model after stratification by clinical and virological features. The FEQ was 1.21% overall, and was highest in Group IV patients and in patients above 50 years of age. In contrast, nine Group IV patients aged below 50 years who were infected with serotype adw had an inversely higher FEQ than those above 50; the age effect among hepatocellular carcinoma patients was significantly different from that among non-cancerous patients (P = 0.04). Variation of amino acid clustered within a determinant and CTL epitope for serotype adw but was distributed at random for serotype adr. Mutation hotspots differed between serotypes adw and adr. The FEQ of HBV surface protein is correlated positively with advancing age and severity of liver disease, and certain variants may contribute to the persistence of HBV infection."
2577,0.003,3.0,"As a result of the potent drug combinations of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors currently available, it is now possible to achieve extreme reductions in the numbers of viral particles in the peripheral blood of HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment, to the point that they are undetectable. Moreover, the immunological recovery resulting from continued and prolonged use of these drugs significantly reduces both mortality and the incidence of opportunistic infections. However, the strict therapeutic regimens required, the number of pills, adverse events and the stigma of a disease that requires the patient to introduce pill-taking into his/her lifestyle brings into question one aspect of mental health, which is motivation to do that which is being proposed. We investigated the influence of each of the components of the adherence trilogy: information, motivation and behavioral abilities, as risk factors in a population of HIV-positive/AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment in the city of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil."
8947,0.003,3.0,"The HIV susceptibility and resistance alleles in the HLA genes were determined by investigating the distribution characteristics of the HLA alleles (A, B, and DRB1) in HIV-infected individuals of the Han population in Hubei, and by comparing these alleles with HIV-negative individuals from the same area. A cohort of 424 HIV-1 infected individuals were chosen as study subjects, and 836 HIV-negative healthy subjects from the same area served as the control population. HLA-A, B, and DRB1 allele typing was performed using polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) and polymerase chain reaction-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) techniques. Arlequin ver3.0 was used to analyze the allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA-A, B, and DRB 1, whereas Epi Info 7 and SPSS18.0 was used to analyze the differences in the HLA alleles between the HIV-1 positive and HIV-1 negative groups. A*02:03, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 alleles and their haplotypes as well as the HLA_Bw4-Bw6 hybrid showed a protective effect on HIV-1 infection. After adjusting for confounding factors such as age and sex, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that B*15:02G, DRB1*01:01, and DRB1*15:01 subtypes were the resistance genes of HIV-1 infection, while B*13:01 might increase susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. The correlation between A*02:06 and B*15:01G subtypes and HIV-1 susceptibility was independent of the age and sex of the host. This study demonstrated the influence of genetic factors in humans such as HLA polymorphism on individuals to resist HIV-1 infection. Association studies of HLA polymorphism, susceptibility/resistance to HIV-1 infection, and hosts' genetic background are of significant importance for research on HIV-1 pathogenesis and vaccine design."

We found a novel GPGGMI motif in the V3 loop, a novel insertion of a proline in the C3 region, and persistent deletion of two amino acids in the vif gene. The patient had been treated with HAART after diagnosis. Forty months after the first amplification of HIV-1 DNA, anti-HIV-1 antibody was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot and, thus, we amplified and sequenced HIV-1 full sequences. Interestingly, the sequence at the TATAA box was TAAAA, although full sequences were not CRF01_AE. The major differences in the level of the HIV-1 gene between the seronegative and seropositive states were changes at the glycosylation site (NXT) next to the inserted proline and many resistance mutations including M184V to antiretroviral drugs occurred. This is the first report on HIV-1 full sequences isolated from seronegative AIDS patients infected with subtype B in Korea."
3865,0.003,3.0,"A major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is hepatitis B virus (HBV), whose pathogenesis is exacerbated by the acquisition of mutations that accelerate carcinogenesis. We examined, with mass spectrometry, the temporality of an HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) double mutation in plasma and tumors. Initial studies found that 52 of 70 (74.3%) tumors from patients residing in Qidong, People's Republic of China, contained this HBV mutation. Paired plasma samples were available for six of the tumor specimens; four tumors had the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation, whereas three of the paired plasma samples were also positive. The potential predictive value of this biomarker was explored by using stored plasma samples from a study of 120 residents of Qidong who had been monitored for aflatoxin exposure and HBV infection. After 10 years of passive follow-up, there were six cases of major liver disease including HCC (four cases), hepatitis (one case), and cirrhosis (one case). All six cases had detectable levels of the HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation up to 8 years before diagnosis. Finally, 15 liver cancers were selected from a prospective cohort of 1,638 high-risk individuals in Qidong on the basis of available plasma samples spanning the years before and after diagnosis. The HBV 1762(T)/1764(A) mutation was detected in 8 of the 15 cases (53.3%) before cancer. The persistence of detection of this mutation was statistically significant (P = 0.022, two-tailed). We therefore found that a prediagnosis biomarker of specific HBV mutations can be measured in plasma and suggest this marker for use as an intermediate endpoint in prevention and intervention trials."

The study also investigated which patients do not receive guideline treatment. We used a retrospective cross-sectional study design using medical and pharmacy claims data. Data from 1,791 HIV-infected patients using antiretroviral agents between 1 February 1998 and 31 July 1999, including demographic characteristics, medication guideline use, medication adherence and cost of care, were examined. Factors associated with total health care costs and time-to-inpatient admission (as a proxy for patient outcomes) were assessed. Patients receiving guideline (HAART) therapy (55%) had higher prescription and total health care costs but lower medical costs. Patients not receiving treatment according to guidelines were more likely to be female, older, have comorbidities, lower medication adherence and no AIDS-defining illness. Treatment with HAART guidelines was associated with longer time-to-inpatient admission controlling for other factors. In a short-term cross-sectional analysis, patients treated with HAART guidelines had better outcomes based on time-to-inpatient admission but higher prescription and total health care costs. Some patients are at risk for not receiving care according to national treatment guidelines and may be targeted for intervention programmes."
1509,0.003,3.0,"Several recent studies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients have identified micronutrient deficiencies as affecting progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death. Although the mechanisms are not known, micronutrient deficiencies may exacerbate the oxidative stress induced by HIV. In addition, infection and its evolution likely lead to an increased requirement for nutritional micronutrients, especially antioxidants. To evaluate this, 40 relatively healthy, institutionalized HIV-infected individuals were recruited for assessment before or three months after fresh fruit and vegetable supply were increased due to seasonal supply. Seven-day dietary records were recorded at the beginning (December) and end of the three-month study period (March). Oxidative stress indices and CD4+, CD38+/CD8+, and CD95+ T-lymphocyte subsets were also measured at these times. No significant differences were found in calorie or protein intake across the study period, but vitamin A, C, and E intakes all increased. A number of redox indicators were modified (increase: total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione; and decrease: superoxide dismutase) during the study period. However, no change in malondialdehyde, hydroperoxides, or DNA damage was noted but a significant reduction in CD38+/CD8+ relative count was seen. Within the context and limitations of this study, the increase of dietary fruits and vegetables intake for three months had some beneficial effects on nutrition, systemic redox balance, and immune parameters in HIV-infected persons."

We searched for articles on medline using the terms, ""Hepatitis C"", ""Prevalence"", ""Epidemiology"", ""Africa"" and ""Treatment"". The bibliographies of the articles found were used to find other references. We included articles published after 1995 only. The data was summarized and presented in tables and figures. Africa has the highest WHO estimated regional HCV prevalence (5.3%). Egypt has the highest prevalence (17.5%) of HCV in the world. Genotypes commonly found in Africa are 1, 4 and 5. Genotype 3 is found in Egypt and parts of Central Africa. Blood transfusion is a major means of acquisition of HCV infection. While treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin is recommended for patients with chronic HCV, no data were found on their use in Africa. Neither were there any data on definitive management (liver transplantation) for those with end stage disease. Data on HCV infection in Africa are scarce. This suggests that hepatitis C is still a neglected disease in many countries. Limited data exist in literature on HCV in Africa."
1697,0.003,3.0,"The feasibility of using a trans-dominant interfering human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope mutant for inducible gene therapy of HIV infection was investigated. Genes encoding wild-type or mutant glycoproteins were introduced into CD4+ cells, where they were stably maintained but not expressed until induced. Envelope (env) gene expression was dependent upon the viral regulatory protein Tat. Induction of the mutant env resulted in resistance to cytopathic effects mediated by wild-type envelope and decreased infectious vector virus production. When cells containing the mutant env gene were infected with wild-type virus, viral spread was inhibited. The fact that maintenance of the env gene was stable over time suggests that inducible gene therapy using the dominantly interfering env mutant may be a feasible approach to slowing the progression of HIV-1 disease."
2085,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an in-frame stop codon within the pre-core region of the virus genome caused fulminant hepatitis in two individuals. Serum from a chronically infected patient who was the source of the virus was inoculated into three chimpanzees at dilutions of 10(-1), 10(-3), and 10(-7). All three chimpanzees developed acute hepatitis B with relatively high peak values of liver enzymes in their serum. The complete nucleotide sequence of virus DNA recovered from the chimpanzee serum by enzymatic amplification was identical with that from the human serum. By comparing the sequence of this strain (HT) with that of 32 published HBV genomes, changes in nucleotides and predicted amino acids that were rarely or never found in other HBV isolates were identified. Thirteen such nucleotides were found within the cis-acting regulatory elements, of which 6 were within the enhancer II-core promoter region. Twenty-four rare or unique changes in amino acids were found in open reading frames, of which 15 occurred in the region that spanned the 3' half of the X gene, through the pre-core/core gene, to the 5' end of the polymerase gene. Thus, an HBV pre-core stop mutant implicated in fulminant hepatitis is highly infectious, induces severe hepatitis in chimpanzees, and possesses significant genetic variation from reported HBV isolates."

Moreover, HIV infection is associated with accelerated coronary atherosclerosis and vasculopathy, although the mechanisms underlying these findings have not been determined. We describe the case of a 45-year-old woman with HIV/HCV coinfection, irritable bowel syndrome, and accelerated progression of coronary atherosclerosis after execution of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this case, the rapidity of progression of atherosclerosis seems linked principally to chronic inflammation and excess immune activation that can depend by a concourse of factors (chronic C hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, PCI execution) not directly associated with traditional risk factors. Caregivers following HIV-infected patients should be aware of the increased risk of accelerated atherogenesis in these subjects, principally in case of presence of causes of intense immune activation."
9298,0.003,3.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common because of their shared modes of transmission. HIV infection alters the natural history of HBV infection, leading to more severe liver disease, decreased hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and higher HBV DNA levels. Furthermore, end-stage liver disease has emerged as a common cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected persons receiving HAART. For these reasons, it is important to vaccinate susceptible persons against HBV infection and to diagnose and treat chronic hepatitis B in HIV-infected persons. The treatment plan for chronic hepatitis B needs to be individualized based on the stage of both viral infections and the available options. It is anticipated that we are entering a period of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B, but the ideal combination needs to be elucidated."
3857,0.003,3.0,"The evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) env gp120 region was addressed in HIV-1 infected children showing virological failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Sequence analysis of the replicating plasma virus at baseline and after one year of therapy documented evolution of gp120 in all subjects but one. Analysis of the host's selective pressure showed that the values of Ka/Ks ratios were higher in the V3 sequence than in the whole C2-V5 region in 4 of 5 children with improvement of thymic output. Moreover, in 2 of the 4 chidren, the V3 evolution paralleled with a reverse shift of the viral phenotype (from CXCR4-tropic to CCR5-tropic). These results suggest that, under ART, the V3 evolution towards less pathogenic viral variants may be driven by the host's increased selective pressure following restoration of thymic function and immune reconstitution."
8910,0.003,3.0,"We examined consecutive protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected individuals, to distinguish changes resulting from sequence evolution due to possible superinfection. Between July 1997 and December 2001, >/=2 PR and RT samples from 718 persons were sequenced at Stanford University Hospital. Thirty-seven persons had highly divergent sequence pairs characterized by a nucleotide distance of >4.5% in PR or >3.0% in RT. In 16 of 37 sequence pairs, divergence resulted from the loss of mutations during a treatment interruption or from the gain of mutations with reinstitution of treatment. tat and/or gag sequencing of HIV-1 from cryopreserved plasma samples could be performed on 15 of the 21 divergent isolate pairs from persons without a treatment interruption. The sequences of these genes, unaffected by selective drug pressure, were monophyletic. Although HIV-1 PR and RT genes from treated persons may become highly divergent, these changes usually are the result of sequence evolution, rather than superinfection."
4079,0.003,3.0,"There are 3 groups of drugs available for the treatment of patients with HIV disease. These are the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ('nucleoside analogues') [zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, lamivudine and abacavir]; the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz); and the protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and amprenavir). The preferred initial regimen should reduce and maintain plasma HIV RNA below the level of detection. Presently, the regimen of choice consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a protease inhibitor with high in vivo efficacy. An alternative combination consists of 2 nucleoside analogues plus a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Drug interactions are one of the major problems associated with these multidrug regimens. Changes in plasma concentrations of the nucleoside analogues are unlikely to be of clinical relevance as drug effect is mainly dependent on the rate and extent of intracellular phosphorylation. Combinations of zidovudine plus stavudine, and probably zalcitabine plus lamivudine, should be avoided as competition for phosphorylating enzymes may occur. The antiviral efficacy of some nucleoside analogues, e.g. stavudine, may be compromised by prior treatment with other nucleosides (e.g. zidovudine). However, these data need to be clarified in further studies. It is unlikely that administration of other antiretrovirals will influence the activity of nucleoside analogues. Protease inhibitors are metabolised by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. Combination protease inhibitor therapy can result in drug interactions mediated by enzyme inhibition. Ritonavir is the most potent inhibitor, saquinavir the least. The protease inhibitors also interact with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Nevirapine and efavirenz induce drug metabolising enzymes and may reduce plasma concentrations of protease inhibitors. A study in healthy volunteers showed that nelfinavir concentrations are increased by combination with efavirenz. Delavirdine inhibits drug metabolising enzymes and increases the plasma concentration of coadministered protease inhibitors. The nucleoside analogues would not be expected to interact with the protease inhibitors. Apart from the ability of didanosine to reduce the area under the concentration-time curve of delavirdine, there are no reports of clinically significant interactions of other antiretrovirals with the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Triple therapy is the current standard of care for patients with HIV disease. However, studies of quadruple therapy are already under way. Drug interactions are likely to remain one of the major considerations when selecting a therapeutic regimen for patients with HIV."
4233,0.003,3.0,"In order to assess the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance mutation profiles and evaluate the distribution of the genetic subtypes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, blood samples from 547 HIV-1 infected patients failing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, were collected during the years 2002 and 2003 to perform the viral resistance genotyping at the Renageno Laboratory from Rio de Janeiro (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation). Viral resistance genotyping was performed using ViroSeq Genotyping System (Celera Diagnostic-Abbott, US). The HIV-1 subtyping based on polymerase (pol) gene sequences (protease and reverse transcriptase-RT regions) was as follows: subtype B (91.2%), subtype F (4.9%), and B/F viral recombinant forms (3.3%). The subtype C was identified in two patients (0.4%) and the recombinant CRF_02/AG virus was found infecting one patient (0.2%). The HIV-1 genotyping profile associated to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors has shown a high frequency of the M184V mutation followed by the timidine-associated mutations. The K103N mutation was the most prevalent to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor and the resistance associated to protease inhibitor showed the minor mutations L63P, L10F/R, and A71V as the more prevalent. A large proportion of subtype B was observed in HIV-1 treated patients from Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we have identified the circulation of drug-resistant HIV-1 subtype C and are presenting the first report of the occurrence of an African recombinant CRF_02/AG virus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A clear association between HIV-1 subtypes and protease resistance mutations was observed in this study. The maintenance of resistance genotyping programs for HIV-1 failing patients is important to the management of ARV therapies and to attempt and monitor the HIV-1 subtype prevalence in Brazil."
4515,0.003,3.0,"We present a case of a clinical manifest hepatitis B virus infection and a potentially misleading HBV serological profile in an HIV-1 positive patient despite previous HBV vaccination. The patient presented with an acute hepatitis B and there was no indication of chronic HBV infection or the presence of a mutation in the 'a' determinant. Remarkably, simultaneously with high HBV surface antigen and HBV viral load, high anti-HBs antibodies were present. If, due to previous HBV vaccination only anti-HBs was tested in this patient, the result of the high anti-HBs antibodies could be very misleading and offering a false sense of security. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to assess HBV specific immunological memory and determining the role of HBV booster vaccinations in immunocompromised individuals."
7230,0.003,3.0,"Like tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease is associated with poverty and social inequalities, conditions that hamper the delivery of care. Like tuberculosis, treatment of HIV infection requires multidrug regimens, and the causative agent acquires drug resistance, which can be transmitted to others. A pilot project in rural Haiti introduced DOT-HAART (directly observed therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy) for the care of patients with advanced acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A similar DOT-HAART effort was launched in Boston for patients with drug-resistant HIV disease who had experienced failure of unsupervised therapy. In both settings, community health promoters or accompagnateurs provide more than DOT: they offer psychosocial support and link patients to clinical staff and available resources. DOT-HAART in these 2 settings presents both challenges and opportunities. These models of care can be applied to other poverty-stricken populations in resource-poor settings."
3126,0.003,3.0,"The aim of immune-based therapies in HIV infection is to enhance numbers and function of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes especially specific anti-HIV cellular immune responses in order to allow immune control of viral replication. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has been extensively studied in phase II trials. Intermittent administration of subcutaneous IL-2 results in substantial increases in CD4 cell counts in most HIV-patients. Two large-scale phase III international studies are addressing the key remaining question of the clinical benefit associated with CD4 cell expansions in HIV-infected patients receiving IL-2. Other cytokines including interferon-alpha are currently under investigation in phase II trials. The goal of therapeutic immunizations is to enhance and broaden the immune system's ability to recognize HIV. Several vaccine candidates, also tested as immunogens for preventive vaccines, are currently studied in phase II trials in patients exhibiting viral suppression under highly active antiretroviral therapy. It has been demonstrated in rhesus monkeys'models that therapeutic immunizations can result in the induction of strong CD4 and CD8 responses associated with viral control and prevention of clinical AIDS, following challenge with a highly pathogenic strain of chimeric SIV-HIV. The clinical efficacy of immune-based strategies remains to be demonstrated in randomized controlled clinical trials. Participation of immune system to control of viral replication may allow simplification of antiretroviral treatment which results in long-term adverse effects having impact in life quality of persons living with HIV."
7073,0.003,3.0,"After notification of a case of fulminant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a 83-year-old female resident of a nursing home to the Flemish Health Inspectorate, a seroepidemiological study and a retrospective cohort study were conducted among the 94 residents and 47 nursing staff to assess the extent of HBV transmission and to identify risk factors. Susceptible residents were vaccinated against HBV and their serological response to hepatitis B vaccination determined. From December 2002 to April 2003, five residents with acute hepatitis B infection were identified with an attack rate of 5.5% and a case fatality rate of 40%. Three other residents were identified as HBV surface antigen and e-antigen positive carrier. None of the nursing staff tested positive for acute HBV infection or HBV carriage. Diabetic patients who were exposed to a shared finger-stick device for blood sampling were 10.7 times more likely to contract an acute HBV infection (RR 10.7; 95% CI 1.3-91.3). Other potential risk factors were undergoing podiatric care and being exposed to the shared razor blade of the hairdresser. The transmission of the infection could be controlled by restricting the use of finger-stick capillary sampling devices to individual patients, assigning separate glucometers to individual patients and, implementation of standard infection-control recommendations like wearing gloves and performing hand hygiene by the nursing staff, assigning separate podiatric sets to individual patients. HBV vaccination of the residents with three doses of HBV vaccine has not induced a sufficient degree of protection. The outbreak stresses the need for appropriate and generally applied standard procedures in nursing homes to prevent bloodborne pathogens."
3897,0.003,3.0,"Hemodialysis (HD) patients are particularly vulnerable to Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and have less sustained and lower antibody response to HBV vaccination. Among blood-borne pathogens, HBV can stay alive on environmental surfaces for over a week. The incidence of HBV was extremely high among HD patients. HBV vaccination, screening of blood products and infection control measures lead to significant decrease of HBV among HD patients. The infection control measures include; Medication safety and injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection, reuse of dialyzers for same patients, hand hygiene, isolation and barrier precautions, HBV vaccination and routine serology checking, assuring HBV immune status for HD unit staff, transmission based precautions and outbreak management.

7691,0.003,3.0,"Magnetic resonance (MR) scans were performed as part of a prospective neuropsychological study within the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. Fifty HIV-1-seronegative men, 85 HIV-1-seropositive men without constitutional symptoms, and 14 with symptomatic HIV disease underwent MR imaging using a uniform protocol. Scans were rated by neuroradiologists blinded to all clinical details except age. The majority of MR scans were normal in all of the clinical groups and no covert mass lesions or diffuse white matter abnormalities were identified. Focal hyperintensities in the white matter were observed in 24% of the HIV-1 seronegatives, 26% of HIV-1 asymptomatic seropositives (CDC II/III), and 17% of those with ARC/AIDS. No significant associations were noted between the white matter hyperintensities and HIV-1 serostatus, neurological abnormalities, CD4 count, alcohol or drug use, hypertension, or smoking. In one individual classified with early HIV-1 dementia, MR demonstrated several hyperintensities in the deep parietal white matter, but at autopsy no microscopic abnormalities corresponding to the MR findings were identified. Our studies imply that focal white matter hyperintensities identified on MR are not specific for HIV-1 infection and are probably incidental and of no clinical significance."

5108,0.003,3.0,"High prevalence of tobacco use and low success in quitting remain significant problems for reducing disease burden among HIV-infected persons. This study's purpose was to examine participant responsiveness and tobacco dependence treatment adherence and their influences on tobacco abstinence among HIV-infected patients. This non-randomized study included HIV-infected smokers 18 years of age or older, who smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day, and had an interest in quitting smoking in the next 30 days. HIV-infected smokers (n = 247) received a 12-week tobacco dependence treatment intervention that included pharmacotherapy and telephone counseling. Younger age and non-White race were associated with lower adherence to pharmacotherapy. Younger age, non-White race, and increased monthly binge drinking were associated with lower adherence to telephone counseling. High participant responsiveness was associated with adherence to pharmacotherapy, counseling, and abstinence. Development and testing of interventions to improve adherence to evidence-based tobacco dependence treatment is warranted."
171,0.003,3.0,"We retrospectively assessed the frequency and clinical characteristics of headache occurring in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in whom we had excluded all other causes, and determined the frequency of a similar headache in an HIV-negative group. Over a 1-year period, the HIV-related headache occurred in 2.8% of total admissions to the HIV service as opposed to 0.2% of admissions to the neurology service. The affected patients had advanced HIV infection (CD4+ cell count = 58.9 +/- 80.3; normal, > 500 x 10(-6)/l). The headache had features similar to those ascribed to HIV aseptic meningitis and was not related to the presence of AIDS dementia complex or its subsequent development over a 6-month follow-up. We propose that this is a distinct clinical entity related to HIV infection that is similar, if not identical, to HIV aseptic meningitis except for the lack of a CSF pleocytosis, probably reflecting the lymphocyte depletion that is characteristic of the more advanced state of HIV infection."
7236,0.003,3.0,"Tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives were shown to specifically block human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication through a unique interaction with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Through further modification of the lead compounds and structure-activity relationship analysis several new TIBO derivatives that show high potency, selectivity, and specificity against HIV-1 have been obtained. A new TIBO derivative, R86183, inhibits the replication of HIV-1, but not HIV-2, in a variety of CD4+ T-cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes, at a concentration of 0.3 to 30 nM, which is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower than the 50% cytotoxic concentration. Whereas an HIV-1 strain containing the Leu-100-->Ile mutation in the RT gene is about 400-fold less susceptible, R86183 still inhibits the replication of an HIV-1 strain containing the Tyr-181-->Cys RT mutation by 50% at a concentration of 130 nM. R86183 inhibits the poly(C).oligo(dG)12-18-directed HIV-1 RT reaction by 50% at a concentration of 57 nM. The antiviral activity of 22 TIBO derivatives in cell culture correlated well with their activity against HIV-1 RT. No such correlation was found for their cytotoxicity. The combination of R86183 with either zidovudine or didanosine resulted in a synergistic inhibition of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication. Combination of R86183 with the protease inhibitor Ro31-8959 was found to be additive. Also described is a dilution protocol circumventing overestimation and underestimation of antiviral activity due to adherence to plastic surfaces."
7171,0.003,3.0,"We report four cases of immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmitted through heterosexual contact in persons who were not homosexual, addicted to intravenous narcotic drugs, or hemophilic. Each transmission occurred in a different setting. A 23-year-old white woman had immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura in July 1985, with a platelet count of 11 X 10(9)/L. In January 1987, she had prominent submandibular and posterior cervical adenopathy. A careful social-sexual history revealed several sexual contacts with a male narcotic addict before July 1985. A 27-year-old heterosexual white man had a platelet count of 8 X 10(9)/L in December 1986. A social-sexual history revealed that his fiancée had been an intravenous narcotic addict 6 years ago. A 64-year-old white woman had a platelet count of 75 X 10(9)/L in May 1986, approximately 2 years after she had resumed having sexual intercourse with her husband who had had a triple coronary bypass in October 1983. The husband had received HIV-seropositive blood. A 42-year-old white man had a platelet count of 45 X 10(9)/L, which was associated with a cutaneous eruption refractory to antibiotics and antifungal agents. He had had sexual contacts with several women, who, to the best of his knowledge, were neither prostitutes nor intravenous narcotic addicts. He denied homosexuality or drug abuse. All four patients were HIV-seropositive and had circulating immune complexes and platelet-associated IgG, C3C4, and IgM values that were considerably higher than those usually measured in patients with classic autoimmune thrombocytopenia, averaging 2.4-, 2.2-, 6.5- and 5.2-fold higher, respectively. Thus, HIV-related immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura can be heterosexually spread and should become part of the differential diagnosis of unexplained thrombocytopenia. Obtaining a careful social-sexual history is mandatory in such patients."
6274,0.003,3.0,"The social stigma in patients with hepatitis B virus infection has caused several complications for both the patients and the associated medical system. This study aimed at demonstrating the social stigma experienced by these patients in Iran. This is a qualitative study using a content analysis approach with references to primary and secondary sources. The data were collected through 15 unstructured and in-depth interviews conducted in 2014. By analyzing the data, two main themes were noted: extrinsic concepts of social stigma (causing reprehension, embarrassment, and discrimination) and intrinsic concepts of social stigma (sense of rejection, isolation, and frustration). The analysis of participants' experiences showed that social stigma is a simple lack of knowledge among the patients and society and it is more intense in the first days after the diagnosis. Stigma is prevalent among patients with hepatitis B virus, causes them to hide the disease, and provokes various complications for them as well as society. This study emphasizes the necessity of implementing health education programs about hepatitis B and its associated stigma, especially considering the potential impact of a mass media campaign."
9612,0.003,3.0,"Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (NNRTIs) are important components of current combination therapies for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In screening of chemical libraries, we found 6-azido-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AzBBU) and 6-amino-1-benzyl-3-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil (AmBBU) to be highly active and selective inhibitors of HIV-1 replication in vitro. To determine the resistance profiles of these compounds, we conducted a long-term culture of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with escalating concentrations of each compound. After serial passages of the infected cells, escape viruses were obtained, and they were more than 500-fold resistant to the uracil derivatives compared to the wild type. Sequence analysis was conducted for RT of the escape viruses at passages 12 and 24. The amino acid mutation Y181C in the polymerase domain of RT was detected for all escape viruses. Docking studies using the crystal structure of RT showed that AmBBU requires the amino acid residues Leu100, Val106, Tyr181, and Trp229 for exerting its inhibitory effect on HIV-1. Four additional amino acid changes (K451R, R461K, T468P, and D471N) were identified in the RNase H domain of RT; however, their precise role in the acquisition of resistance is still unclear. In conclusion, the initial mutation Y181C seems sufficient for the acquisition of resistance to the uracil derivatives AzBBU and AmBBU. Further studies are required to determine the precise role of each mutation in the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance."
8048,0.003,3.0,"Perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 represents a major problem in many regions of the world, especially Southern Africa. With the exception of viral and proviral load, the role for maternal cofactors in perinatal transmission outcome is largely unknown. In this study, an assessment was made of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) gene-expression profiles to better understand transcriptional changes associated with HIV-1 infection and perinatal transmission among young adult mothers with infants in Botswana. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens were used from 25 HIV+ drug naive and 20 HIV- healthy mothers, similar in age and location, collected in 1999-2000 and 2003, and processed with the exact same methods, as previously described. Expression profiling of 22 277 microarray gene probes implicated a broad initiation of innate response gene-sets, including toll-like receptor, interferon-stimulated and antiviral RNA response pathways in association with maternal HIV-1 infection. Maternal transmission status was further associated with host genes that influence RNA processing and splicing patterns. In addition to real-time polymerase chain reaction validation of specific genes, enriched category validation of PBMC profiles was conducted using two independent data sets for either HIV-1 infection or an unrelated RNA virus, severe acute respiratory virus infection. HIV-1 pathogen-specific host profiles should prove a useful tool in infection and transmission intervention efforts worldwide."
6457,0.003,3.0,"We have investigated the molecular diversity of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) among the HIV co-infected patients from eastern-India. HBsAg/HBV-DNA positive subjects (n=73) from 874 HIV-infected patients were analyzed by sequencing followed by genetic diversity quantification. HBV/genotype-D and HBV/sugenotype-D2 were predominant. HBV/D2 isolates from patients with low CD4 count manifested significantly lower non-synonymous substitutions (p<0.0001) and Shannon entropy (p=0.0006) in their surface and polymerase gene in comparison to those from moderately increased CD4 count. ART-induced immune-reconstitution therefore might raise non-synonymous immune/therapy escape substitutions among these HBV/D2 isolates. Decreased genetic diversity and increased viral load in the HBV/D2 isolates might facilitate the maintenance of their wild type characteristics in the low CD4 count, leading to its increased prevalence in this group. Interestingly, genetic diversity in HBV/A1, the next common subgenotype, was modified in the opposite manner. Together our results underscore the need for proper HBV molecular monitoring in HIV co-infection."
2256,0.003,3.0,"Between 1984 and 1990, virus was routinely isolated and serum collected from patients diagnosed at hospitals in the Western Cape as suffering from AIDS or AIDS-related conditions (ARC). From these, 17 virus strains were selected at random for sequencing and molecular characterisation of the env gene. The strains were previously characterised as belonging to HIV-1 subtypes B, C and D. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate retrospectively the serological diagnosis of HIV-1 in these 17 South African patients. Thirteen anti-HIV screening assays, including 7 rapid/simple test devices (RTDs), 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (EIAs) and 2 Western immunoblot assays were evaluated. Using commercial EIAs, 16 serum samples were HIV antibody-positive and these results were confirmed by Western immunoblot analysis. Serum from one terminal AIDS patient was found negative with all the serological tests. Some RTDs gave false negative antibody reactions on specimens from patients infected with subtype D strains. To investigate the false negative antibody reactions, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify, clone and sequence proviral DNA from the immunodominant gp41 region from 7 of the HIV-1 strains. Two patients, both subtype D strains (D214 and D482) with false negative results in the RTDs, showed a significant amino acid substitution, i.e., substitution of a histidine residue for leucine at env position 607. It was concluded that although there were false negative RTD reactions on patients with HIV-1 subtype D strains, the commercial EIAs tested are sensitive and are able to detect patients infected with HIV-1 subtypes B, C and D that are present in South Africa."
9678,0.003,3.0,"We report the occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis in three infants born to HIV infected women who had high anti-toxoplasma IgG and negative IgM during pregnancy. We briefly reviewed available literature and discussed the possible transmission mechanisms of congenital toxoplasmosis among HIV infected pregnant women. Serum samples were tested for Toxoplasma gondii IgM and IgG antibodies using commercial enzyme immunoassay and IgG-avidity tests. In the first case, fetal death occurred at 28th week of gestation. In the second case, congenital toxoplasmosis was diagnosis at 6th month of life; and in the third case, an HIV-infected newborn, congenital toxoplasmosis was asymptomatic. These cases point out to the possibility of enhanced maternal-fetal transmission of T. gondii infection by HIV-infected women chronically infected, which may have important public health consequences, considering that increasing frequency of HIV-infection has been observed among women of childbearing age around the world."
1605,0.003,3.0,"To achieve optimal virologic suppression for children undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART), adherence must be excellent. This is defined as taking more than 95% of their prescribed doses. To our knowledge, no study in Ethiopia has evaluated the level of treatment adherence at the beginning of the child's treatment. Our aim was therefore to evaluate caregiver-reported ART non-adherence among children and any predictors for this during the early course of treatment. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 306 children with HIV in eight health facilities in Ethiopia who were registered at ART clinics between 20 December 2014 and 20 April 2015. The adherence rate reported by caregivers during the first week and after a month of treatment initiation was 92.8% and 93.8%, respectively. Our findings highlight important predictors of non-adherence. Children whose caregivers were not undergoing HIV treatment and care themselves were less likely to be non-adherent during the first week of treatment (aOR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.71) and the children whose caregivers did not use a medication reminder after one month of treatment initiation (aOR = 5.21, 95% CI: 2.23, 12.16) were more likely to miss the prescribed dose. Moreover, after one month of the treatment initiation, those receiving protease inhibitor (LPV/r) or ABC-based treatment regimens were more likely to be non-adherent (aOR = 12.32, 95% CI: 3.25, 46.67). To promote treatment adherence during ART initiation in children, particular emphasis needs to be placed on a baseline treatment regimen and ways to issue reminders about the child's medication to both the health care system and caregivers. Further, large scale studies using a combination of adherence measuring methods upon treatment initiation are needed to better define the magnitude and predictors of ART non-adherence in resource-limited settings."
574,0.003,3.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy is essential to treatment success for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Despite the wealth of studies in examining antiretroviral non-adherence, few have distinguished between intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The present study attempted to identify factors associated with adherence, intentional non-adherence, and unintentional non-adherence among HIV+ individuals using a longitudinal design. Dietary instructions and medication schedule were also included to measure the subtleties of antiretroviral adherence. One hundred and two HIV+ patients who were under antiretroviral therapy were recruited in an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong at baseline with six months follow-up. Using the conventional adherence rate, only 12 (11.8%) of participants reported having missed/ altered medication in the past four days. However, using a more comprehensive assessment, only 27 (26.5%) participants were classified as adherers. Results showed that, adherers were significantly older and had higher adherence self-efficacy than those who were unintentional or intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as unintentional non-adherers had longer length of diagnosis and started medication longer than adherers and intentional non-adherers. Participants classified as intentional non-adherers had worse mental health, higher level of self-stigma, and reported higher score in avoidant coping than adherers and unintentional non-adherers. They also scored higher in physical symptoms than adherers. Findings highlight the importance of a reliable, comprehensive measurement for adherence and extend on previous adherence literature that intentional and unintentional non-adherence are separate entities and are associated with different factors. Future research should understand the intentions behind non-adherence and this would serve as an important guide in the development of interventions aimed at improving antiretroviral adherence for HIV+ patients."
2709,0.003,3.0,"Chronic hepatitis B affects nearly 10% of HIV-infected patients. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a dynamic disease and coinfection with HIV impacts directly on the outcome of HBV infection, considerably complicating its natural history, diagnosis, and management. The aim of this study was to compare two cohorts of HBV monoinfected and HBV/HIV coinfected Iranian patients undergoing long-term lamivudine therapy from the clinical and virological aspects, as well as the frequency of detected mutations in HBV genome. To this end, HBV Pol/S regions from 72 patients were PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a 40-times higher risk of coinfection with ayw3 subtype of HBV genotype D rather than ayw2 subtype [P<0.001, odd: 40.66, CI: 95 % (4.69-352.23)]. While no resistance mutation was detected in HBV/HIV coinfected cohort, LAM-resistance mutations (rtM204I/V in YMDD and rtL180M in FLLA polymerase motifs) were identified in 30% (9 out of 30) and 16.66% (5 out of 30) of HBV monoinfected patients (P<0.05). Moreover, several mutations (sP105A, sI110S/L, sS136Y and sP127T/L) with significant differences in the frequency were identified in the S region of both cohorts. Finally, this study found strong correlation between the type of infection (mono or coinfection) and characteristics like patient gender, ALT levels, HBV-DNA levels and HBV subtypes. These results pointed to the importance of determination of HBV variants in the management of patients and suggested that in contrary to HBV monoinfections, LAM may be still an appropriate drug for the treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV coinfected patients; however, further studies to clarify the role of HIV in HBV LAM-resistance mutations are required."
7837,0.003,3.0,"The effect of macrophage (M)-tropic and T cell line (T)-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on antigen-specific CD4 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) has been studied using a CD4 CTL line specific for a peptide from influenza B virus hemagglutinin. In the absence of antigen presentation, the production of CC chemokines was low. Both the M-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1AD) and the T-tropic HIV-1 strain (HIV-1LAI) established productive infections in the CD4 CTLs, decreasing antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Peptide presented to the CD4 CTLs increased their secretion of RANTES and MIP-1beta, suppressed M-tropic HIV-1 replication, downmodulated CCR5 expression, and preserved CTL recognition. The suppression of M-tropic HIV-1 replication and downmodulation of the CCR5 receptor likely resulted from CC chemokine secretion since antibodies to CC chemokines restored M-tropic HIV-1 replication. Antigen presentation did not protect CD4 CTLs from T-tropic HIV-1 infection or preserve their CTL recognition. Thus, these CD4 CTLs do not make suppressor factors that inhibit the T-tropic HIV-1LAI isolate. The results indicate that these CD4 CTLs can either harbor or suppress M-tropic HIV-1 infection, depending on whether antigen is present. CD4 CTLs might therefore provide some protection in the early stages of HIV-1 infection when M-tropic isolates are present."
6651,0.003,3.0,"Current interferon (IFN)-based therapies for hepatitis C in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) may be limited by incomplete virological response, lack of adherence, and poor tolerability. Newer therapies for hepatitis C will target viral replication (e.g., HCV serine protease inhibitors, helicase inhibitors, RNA interference, or an HCV polymerase inhibitor). Other treatments will focus on viral translation (e.g., antisense molecules). Additions to IFN therapy that can modulate the immune response (e.g., thymosin, isatorbine, or injectable histamine) may improve tolerability of treatment. There need to be targets that minimize the inflammatory response by the liver (e.g., IFN-gamma). There are some therapeutic vaccines in early development. Drugs to replace or enhance ribavirin are being studied with IFN-based treatments. Strategic treatment trials that address sequencing of HCV and HIV therapy with current and future therapeutic agents and combination therapy need to be undertaken."

2952,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected children. However, development of ARV resistance in these children is a major public health problem due to lack of availability of and access to new drugs. This study was conducted in order to identify circulating HIV subtypes and recombinant forms and evaluate the drug resistance mutation patterns in 18 HIV-1 infected children failing ARV treatment in Kelantan, Malaysia. Genotyping for codon 1-99 of protease (PR) and 1-250 of reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, these were phylogenetically analyzed to determine the subtypes. CRF33_01B (44.4%) was found to be the predominant HIV subtype, followed by B (27.8%), CRF15_01B (16.7%) and CRF01_AE (11.1%) subtypes. The most prevalent RT mutations were T215F/V/Y (66.7%), D67G/N (55.6%), K219Q/E/R (44.4%), M184V/I (38.9%), K70R/E (27.8%) and M41L (27.8%), associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) resistance; and K103N (55.6%), G190A (33.3%), and K101P/E/H (27.8%) associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) resistance. The results showed a possible emergence of CRF33_01B as current predominant subtypes/circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), and a high frequency of primary mutations among HIV-1 infected children after failure of ARV therapy in Kelantan, Malaysia."
5988,0.003,3.0,"Adverse reactions to the standard dose (1,200 mg/day-1,500 mg/day) of azidothymidine (AZT) are serious. An in vitro pharmacokinetic study of intracellular AZT-5'-triphosphate suggested the feasibility of a clinical trial with reduced doses of AZT. A randomized trial with reduced doses of AZT (group A; 400 mg/day, n = 15, group B; 800 mg/day, n = 13), was conducted enrolling 28 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The effective rate of AZT on CD4+ lymphocyte counts was similar for both groups, but the duration of the effect of AZT was significantly longer in group A (p less than 0.05). In group B, adverse reactions were more frequently observed (p less than 0.01), and AZT was withdrawn or the dose was reduced more frequently (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that AZT at a dose of 400 mg/day is less toxic, and is more beneficial for long-term treatment."
631,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 3.5 million persons in the United States (1), making it the most common bloodborne infection in the country. Recent surveillance data showed increased rates of HCV infection among adolescents and adults who are predominantly white, live in nonurban areas, and have a history of injection drug use.* U.S. birth certificate data were used to analyze trends and geographic variations in rates of HCV infection among women giving birth during 2009-2014. Birth certificates from Tennessee were used to examine individual characteristics and outcomes associated with HCV infection, using a multivariable model to calculate adjusted odds of HCV-related diagnosis in pregnancy among women with live births. During 2009-2014, HCV infection present at the time of delivery among pregnant women from states reporting HCV on the birth certificate increased 89%, from 1.8 to 3.4 per 1,000 live births. The highest infection rate in 2014 (22.6 per 1,000 live births) was in West Virginia; the rate in Tennessee was 10.1. In adjusted analyses of Tennessee births, the odds of HCV infection were approximately threefold higher among women residing in rural counties than among those in large urban counties, 4.5-fold higher among women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy, and nearly 17-fold higher among women with concurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HCV infection among pregnant women is an increasing and potentially modifiable threat to maternal and child health. Clinicians and public health officials should consider individual and population-level opportunities for prevention and risk mitigation."
7063,0.003,3.0,"The prevalence of antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV-1) was determined in 924 outpatients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic. The overall prevalence of anti-HIV-1 was 9%. Six of 14 intravenous drug addicts and 4 of 34 patients of African origin were anti-HIV-1 positive. In the other 876 patients, the anti-HIV prevalence was 6.6% in 467 heterosexual men, 5% in 261 heterosexual women and 22.3% in 148 homosexual or bisexual men. The prevalence of anti-HIV-1 in the heterosexual subjects was much higher than that expected in the general population and than that observed in patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in other developed countries. Intravenous drug abusers, who represent the most important group at risk for AIDS in Italy, could contribute to the spread of HIV infection through heterosexual contacts with persons without other known risk factors."
4422,0.003,3.0,"Although the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has become a chronic illness, disease-specific advance care planning has not yet been evaluated for the palliative care needs of adults with HIV/AIDS. This prospective, longitudinal, randomized, two-arm controlled clinical trial aims to test the efficacy of FAmily CEntered advance care planning among adults living with AIDS and/or HIV with co-morbidities on congruence in treatment preferences, healthcare utilization, and quality of life. The FAmily CEntered intervention arm is two face-to-face sessions with a trained, certified facilitator: Session 1) Disease-Specific Advance Care Planning Respecting Choices Interview; Session 2) Completion of advance directive. The Healthy Living Control arm is: Session 1) Developmental/Relationship History; Session 2) Nutrition. Follow-up data will be collected at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention. A total of 288 patient/surrogate dyads will be enrolled from five hospital-based, out-patient clinics in Washington, District of Columbia. Participants will be HIV positive and ≥ 21 years of age; surrogates will be ≥ 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria are homicidality, suicidality, psychosis, and impaired cognitive functioning. We hypothesize that this intervention will enhance patient-centered communication with a surrogate decision-maker about end of life treatment preferences over time, enhance patient quality of life and decrease health care utilization. We further hypothesize that this intervention will decrease health disparities for Blacks in completion of advance directives. If proposed aims are achieved, the benefits of palliative care, particularly increased treatment preferences about end-of-life care and enhanced quality of life, will be extended to people living with AIDS."
8753,0.003,3.0,"An association of increased weight with a slower progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been reported in studies that have not included large numbers of women. We evaluated the association of HIV disease progression with body mass index (BMI) in 871 women and present cross-sectional, survival, and longitudinal analyses. A higher baseline BMI was associated with a lower rate of occurrence of the first CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm(3). In analyses that incorporated time-varying BMI, underweight and normal women had an increased risk of clinical acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and underweight women had increased risk of HIV-related death, compared with obese women. The association between change in BMI and CD4 cell count was estimated; increases in BMI were associated with slight increases in CD4 cell counts, even after controlling for prior values of CD4 cell count, viral load, and treatment. Higher BMI and increases in BMI are associated with a decreased risk of HIV progression."
1272,0.003,3.0,"In order to analyse temporal trends in vertical transmission rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and determinant of congenital HIV infection in Italy, we have considered data from a network of hospitals co-operating in the Italian Collaborative Study on HIV infection in pregnancy, conducted between 1988 and 1995. A total of 1040 women entered the study. The HIV-1 status of the babies was known in 848 cases (81.5%). Transmission rates were highest in the period 1988-1991, then tended to decrease and in 1995 the rate was 9.7 per 100 children (this finding, however, was based on only six infected children and the trend was not statistically significant). Considering the overall series, the risk of vertical HIV transmission was higher in women with low CD4 count in pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) < 400 versus > or = 400 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.9]. In comparison with vaginal delivery the risk of transmission was 0.3 (95% CI 0.1-0.5) and 0.6 (95% CI 0.3-1.2) respectively for elective and emergency delivery. In comparison with women who delivered at term (> or = 37 gestation weeks) the OR of HIV infection of the babies for the whole series was 2.2 (95% CI 1.3-3.6) in women who delivered preterm. Similar findings emerged when the analysis was conducted considering, separately, subjects observed in the period 1988-1991 and 1992-1995. The frequency of Caesarean section increased from 26.5% of deliveries in 1988-1991 to 36.2% in 1992-1995. Consequently, most temporal differences disappeared after standardization for mode of delivery, but the rate in 1995 was still lower than in 1988-1994."
2794,0.003,3.0,"An increased incidence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite this association, hitherto only a single case of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in an HIV-infected patient during pregnancy. We describe a young multiparous patient with long-standing AIDS who presented with lower abdominal pain. Following findings of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, low-grade fever, and mental status changes, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was diagnosed after initially considering the diagnosis of severe preeclampsia, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section. The patient required multiple plasma exchanges during a protracted postpartum course, and was discharged in good health. This first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and AIDS in pregnancy demonstrates that when encountering preeclampsia in patients with AIDS, thrombotic microangiopathy should be strongly considered. In addition, these patients may exhibit an attenuated response to plasma exchange therapy and despite previous reports in nonobstetric patients, a favorable outcome is attainable in these critically ill patients."

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its related factors among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 259 patients at a tertiary care hospital. HRQOL was assessed using the Thai version of the Medical Outcomes Study HIV Health Survey (MOS-HIV) questionnaire. Socio-demographics and clinical status were measured using a self-administered questionnaire. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore associations between socio-demographic status, clinical status, and HRQL. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that employment status was strongly related to better overall physical and mental health summary scores (PHS, MHS). In addition, patients with disclosure of HIV status, aged over 50 years, and having at least a rating of good health in the nurses' opinion were the independent positive predictive factors for overall PHS. While being on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and good compliance with ART were positive predictive factors for overall MHS. Improving and strengthening quality of life among PLWHAs are important goals for HIV/AIDS services. Regular assessment of HRQL can provide potential information for intervention to improve quality of life."
233,0.003,3.0,"Pneumocystis pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary infection that occurs in immunocompromised individuals and HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 cell count. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been used as the first-line agent for treatment, but mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene render potential resistance to sulfamide. Despite advances of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to occur in HIV-infected patients with late presentation for cART or virological and immunological failure after receiving cART. Areas covered: This review summarizes the diagnosis and first-line and alternative treatment and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. Articles for this review were identified through searching PubMed. Search terms included: 'Pneumocystis pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia', 'Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia', 'trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole', 'primaquine', 'trimetrexate', 'dapsone', 'pentamidine', 'atovaquone', 'echinocandins', 'human immunodeficiency virus infection', 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'resistance to sulfamide' and combinations of these terms. We limited the search to English language papers that were published between 1981 and March 2017. We screened all identified articles and cross-referenced studies from retrieved articles. Expert commentary: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will continue to be the first-line agent for Pneumocystis pneumonia given its cost, availability of both oral and parenteral formulations, and effectiveness or efficacy in both treatment and prophylaxis. Whether resistance due to mutations within dihydropteroate synthase gene compromises treatment effectiveness remains controversial. Continued search for effective alternatives with better safety profiles for Pneumocystis pneumonia is warranted."
1067,0.003,3.0,The role of placenta in vertical transmission is not yet fully understood. A protective role of the placenta during gestation is suggested by the finding that caesarian sections reduce the risk of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 from mother to child three- to fourfold. Here we investigated whether the immunological milieu of the placenta might be important in HIV-1 transmission. In situ imaging of immunohistochemically stained placenta sections and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated a fourfold increase in CCR5:CXCR4 expression ratio in placentae from transmitting women compared to placentae from nontransmitting women. This chemokine receptor repertoire was consistent with an up-regulation of interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 expression in placentae from nontransmitting placentae compared to transmitting placentae. In situ imaging demonstrated that CCR5 and CXCR4 were expressed on placental macrophages and lymphocytes but not in trophoblasts. Simultaneous immunofluorescence/ultrasensitive in situ hybridization for HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA revealed that HIV-1 infects primarily CXCR4-expressing cells in placentae from nontransmitting women whereas predominantly CCR5-expressing cells were infected in placentae from transmitting women. These data are consistent with transmission of a homogeneous population of nonsyncytium-inducing HIV-1 isolates that use CCR5 as co-receptor.
3028,0.003,3.0,"Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of drug-sensitive HIV transmission but may increase the transmission of drug-resistant HIV. We used a mathematical model to estimate the long-term population-level benefits of ART and determine the scenarios under which earlier ART (treatment at 1 year post-infection, on average) could decrease simultaneously both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence (new infections). We constructed an infection-age-structured mathematical model that tracked the transmission rates over the course of infection and modelled the patients' life expectancy as a function of ART initiation timing. We fitted this model to the annual AIDS incidence and death data directly, and to resistance data and demographic data indirectly among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. Using counterfactual scenarios, we assessed the impact on total and drug-resistant HIV incidence of ART initiation timing, frequency of acquired drug resistance, and second-line drug effectiveness (defined as the combination of resistance monitoring, biomedical drug efficacy and adherence). Earlier ART initiation could decrease the number of both total and drug-resistant HIV incidence when second-line drug effectiveness is sufficiently high (greater than 80%), but increase the proportion of new infections that are drug resistant. Thus, resistance may paradoxically appear to be increasing while actually decreasing."
2029,0.003,3.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) is characterized by HBV DNA positivity but HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) negativity. Occult HBV infection is associated with a risk of HBV transmission through blood transfusion, hemodialysis, and liver transplantation. Furthermore, occult HBV infection contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We recently reported the characteristic molecular features of mutations in the preS/S regions among Korean individuals with occult infections caused by HBV genotype C2; the variants of preS and S related to severe liver diseases among chronically infected patients were also responsible for the majority of HBV occult infections. We also reported that HBsAg variants from occult-infected Korean individuals exhibit lower HBsAg secretion capacity but not reduced HBV DNA levels. In addition, these variants exhibit increased ROS-inducing capacity compared with the wild-type strain, linking HBV occult infections to liver cell damage. Taken together, our previous reports suggest the transmission potential of distinct HBV occult infection-related variants in South Korea. "
4245,0.003,3.0,"Concerns about the possible release of smallpox by bioterrorists has led to policies that recommend smallpox vaccination of some health care providers, and, in the near future, the vaccine may become available to the general population on a voluntary basis. Both smallpox virus (variola virus) and the smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) will have a significant impact on people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Given that populations with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and populations with immunosuppressed conditions due to solid organ and bone marrow transplantation were not present in the days when smallpox was prevalent, we will speculate on how smallpox might present in immunodeficient patients, and we will review the adverse events expected from the smallpox vaccine in hosts with HIV infection."
7739,0.003,3.0,"The efficacy of oral, intestinal, nasal, and vaginal vaccinations with DNA simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-15, SIV Gag/Pol/Env recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA), and AT-2 SIVmac239 inactivated particles was compared in rhesus macaques after low-dose vaginal challenge with SIVmac251. Intestinal immunization provided better protection from infection, as a significantly greater median number of challenges was necessary in this group than in the others. Oral and nasal vaccinations provided the most significant control of disease progression. Fifty percent of the orally and nasally vaccinated animals suppressed viremia to undetectable levels, while this occurred to a significantly lower degree in intestinally and vaginally vaccinated animals and in controls. Viremia remained undetectable after CD8(+) T-cell depletion in seven vaccinated animals that had suppressed viremia after infection, and tissue analysis for SIV DNA and RNA was negative, a result consistent with a significant reduction of viral activity. Regardless of the route of vaccination, mucosal vaccinations prevented loss of CD4(+) central memory and CD4(+)/α4β7(+) T-cell populations and reduced immune activation to different degrees. None of the orally vaccinated animals and only one of the nasally vaccinated animals developed AIDS after 72 to 84 weeks of infection, when the trial was closed. The levels of anti-SIV gamma interferon-positive, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells at the time of first challenge inversely correlated with viremia and directly correlated with protection from infection and longer survival.

193,0.003,3.0,"To determine the types and rates of tumors which may be associated with HIV infection in women, we used cancer incidence data from New York and northern New Jersey. We examined changes in incidence of selected cancers in women aged 20-49 years and compared groups differing in incidence of AIDS. Black women were compared to white women in New York City and in the remainder of New York State; for cervical cancer, rates were also compared for Blacks and Whites in northern New Jersey. The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma in women increased in New York City, beginning in 1982 for Blacks and in 1984 for Whites, but remained stable in the remainder of New York State. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in New York women doubled in Blacks after 1982 whereas incidence trends in Whites were unchanged. No consistent variation was seen in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease. Cervical cancer in New York and northern New Jersey Blacks declined over the same period by approximately 40% for invasive tumors and 50% for in situ lesions. The HIV epidemic is associated with substantial excesses of Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women. The absence of Kaposi's sarcoma in upstate New York women suggests the existence of a geographically restricted co-factor(s) for Kaposi's sarcoma in addition to HIV. If HIV affected cervical cancer incidence through 1988, its impact was small compared to the striking decreases which followed widespread adoption of Papanicolaou screening."
2362,0.003,3.0,"New human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) diagnoses are increasing rapidly in Hebei. The aim of this study presents the most extensive HIV-1 molecular epidemiology investigation in Hebei province in China thus far. We have carried out the most extensive systematic cross-sectional study based on newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in 2013, and characterized the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequences in the whole of Hebei. Nine HIV-1 genotypes based on full length gag-partial pol gene sequence were identified among 610 newly diagnosed naïve individuals. The four main genotypes were circulating recombinant form (CRF)01_AE (53.4%), CRF07_BC (23.4%), subtype B (15.9%), and unique recombinant forms URFs (4.9%). Within 1 year, three new genotypes (subtype A1, CRF55_01B, CRF65_cpx), unknown before in Hebei, were first found among men who have sex with men (MSM). All nine genotypes were identified in the sexually contracted HIV-1 population. Among 30 URFs, six recombinant patterns were revealed, including CRF01_AE/BC (40.0%), CRF01_AE/B (23.3%), B/C (16.7%), CRF01_AE/C (13.3%), CRF01_AE/B/A2 (3.3%) and CRF01_AE/BC/A2 (3.3%), plus two potential CRFs. This study elucidated the complicated characteristics of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in a low HIV-1 prevalence northern province of China and revealed the high level of HIV-1 genetic diversity. All nine HIV-1 genotypes circulating in Hebei have spread out of their initial risk groups into the general population through sexual contact, especially through MSM. This highlights the urgency of HIV prevention and control in China."
2307,0.003,3.0,"Myeloid cells are important reservoirs of HIV-1 infection. In response to pathogenic agents, macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines that can modulate viral replication and contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. Because HIV replication is dependent on cellular activation, immunosuppressive cytokines that deactivate macrophages and T cells may be important modulators of an antiviral effect. We tested the anti-HIV potential of the immunosuppressive cytokine-transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) alone and in combination with AZT in a new monomyeloblastic model of HIV-1 infection. The PLB-985 cell model was infected with HIV IIIB strain, and the course of HIV-1 infection and replication was monitored by reverse transcriptase assay, p24 immunofluorescence, and northern blot analysis of HIV-1-specific mRNA. TGF-beta 1 as a single agent had no effect on the multiplication of HIV-IIIB in de novo-infected PLB 985 monomyeloblastic cells. However, cotreatment with TGF-beta 1 and AZT synergistically slowed virus multiplication within the first week following infection, as determined by reverse transcriptase measurement, p24 antigen detection, and northern blot analysis of viral RNA. The synergistic actions of TGF-beta 1 and AZT were also observed in PLB 985 cells infected with an AZT-resistant strain of HIV-1 (HIV 1393). Synergism between nucleoside analogs and cytokines may be an important therapeutic approach to HIV-1 infection. Elucidation of the role of cytokines in controlling the degree of HIV multiplication may have an impact on both clinical treatments and understanding the progression to AIDS."
2320,0.003,3.0,"Psychological distress is common among adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) worldwide, and has been associated with non-adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), leading to poor virologic suppression, drug resistance, and increased risk for AIDS morbidity and mortality. However, only a few studies have explored the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper examines the relationship between psychological distress and ART adherence, and effect of psychosocial resources on ART adherence. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 464 ALHIV (aged 12-19; 53% female) seeking HIV care at a large HIV treatment center in Kampala, Uganda. ALHIV were recruited during routine clinic visits. Three self-reported binary adherence measures were utilized: missed pills in the past three days, non-adherence to the prescribed medical regimen, and self-rated adherence assessed using a visual analog scale. Psychological distress was measured as a continuous variable, and computed as the mean score on a locally developed and validated 25-item symptom checklist for Ugandan ALHIV. Psychosocial resources included spirituality, religiosity, optimism, social support, and coping strategies. After adjusting for respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and psychosocial resources, a unit increase in psychological distress was associated with increased odds of missing pills in past 3 days (Odds Ratio(OR) = 1.75; Confidence Interval (CI): 1.04-2.95), not following the prescribed regimen (OR = 1.63; CI: 1.08-2.46), and lower self-rated adherence (OR = 1.79; CI: 1.19-2.69). Psychosocial resources were associated with lower odds for non-adherence on all three self-report measures. There is a need to strengthen the psychosocial aspects of adolescent HIV care by developing interventions to identify and prevent psychological distress among Ugandan ALHIV."

In patients with HIV, tenofovir alafenamide was as efficacious as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with reduced bone and renal toxic effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study."
9135,0.003,3.0,"Despite substantial progress in the development of antiretroviral regimens that durably suppress Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, new agents that maintain high efficacy while further optimizing the safety of lifelong, chronic therapy are needed. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF; formerly known as GS-7340) is a novel prodrug of the antiviral acyclic nucleoside phosphonate tenofovir (TFV) with improved properties relative to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Although potent and generally well tolerated, TDF therapy has been associated with changes in markers of renal function, decreases in bone mineral density and a rare occurrence of serious renal adverse events, including Fanconi's Syndrome. The renal and bone toxicity observed with TDF is associated with high circulating plasma levels of TFV. TAF was discovered to be a more efficient prodrug able to further refine HIV therapy and better address life-long therapy in an older and increasingly comorbid HIV infected population. By enhancing stability in biological matrices while being rapidly activated in cells, TAF produces higher levels of intracellular TFV diphosphate, the pharmacologically active metabolite, in HIV-target cells at substantially reduced oral doses of TFV equivalents. All TFV released in the body is eventually eliminated renally; therefore, lowering the TFV equivalents administered reduces off-target kidney exposure. Effective therapy is thus achieved at approximately 90% lower systemic exposure to TFV, translating to statistically and clinically significant improvement in safety parameters associated with bone mineral density and markers of renal function.

7070,0.003,3.0,"For assessing the role of circulating immune complexes (CICs) in acute hepatitis B, CICs containing HBsAg, IgM, and IgG were determined, by C1q and conglutinin (K) assays, in 242 patients with acute hepatitis B and 60 healthy controls. CIC is a common feature of acute hepatitis B with 90.9% of cases having at least one abnormal test result. Patients with shorter interval (< 1 week) between onset of symptoms and patient presentation have significantly higher frequency of abnormal IgM class CIC, HBsAg-specific CIC, and higher frequency of raised alanine aminotransferase activity (> 30-fold upper limit of normal). The prevalence of raised alanine aminotransferase in patients with CIC containing HBsAg and IgM is higher than those without (P = 0.001). There is significant association between HBsAg-CIC and C1q-CIC. In conclusion, HBsAg-CIC and IgM class CIC correlate with disease activity. C1q-binding CIC is the predominant CIC that may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute hepatitis B."

In both years almost one quarter of the dental officers and half the other operating team members chose incorrect information about the methods of transmission of HIV. Several respondents named health care workers as belonging to a high risk group. Fever and loss of weight were known to be early symptoms of AIDS. In 1989, when asked to identify oral manifestations of HIV, one quarter of all the dental staff could not mention any of them. The findings of the study emphasise the need for urgent further education of dental teams in Tanzania."
78,0.003,3.0,"Despite the increasing prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the population and the increasing likelihood that HIV-positive (HIV+) patients may have an extraction, little is known about the risk of postoperative complications in this group. The goal of this investigation was to assess the risk of postoperative complications in HIV+ patients after tooth extraction. The study was designed as a retrospective cohort study with a sample consisting of 145 males who underwent tooth extraction. The patients' medical and dental records were reviewed to identify HIV serostatus, to document the frequency and type of postoperative complications, and to collect data on potential confounding variables. Forty-four patients were identified as HIV+. The postoperative complication rate in HIV+ patients was 20.9% and for HIV-negative (HIV-) patients 2.9% (relative risk = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 2.0-25.0, P = 0.001). Furthermore, as the manifestations of the symptoms of HIV infection became more severe, the postextraction complication rate also increased (P = 0.008). The results of this study suggest that HIV+ patients have an increased risk of postextraction complications and as the level of HIV disease increases, the risk of complications also increases. While the findings of this study are consistent with studies based on case series, prospective cohort studies are required to confirm the findings."
2619,0.003,3.0,"The antiretroviral chemotherapy helps to reduce the mortality of HIVs infected patients. However, RNA dependant virus replication has a high mutation rate. Human immunodeficiency virus Type 1 protease plays an essential role in viral replication cycle. This protein is an important target for therapy with viral protein inhibitors. There are few works using normal mode analysis to investigate this problem from the structural changes viewpoint. The investigation of protein flexibility may be important for the study of processes associated with conformational changes and state transitions. The normal mode analysis allowed us to investigate structural changes in the protease (such as flexibility) in a straightforward way and try to associate these changes with the increase of fitness for each positively selected HIV-1 mutant protease of patients treated with several protease inhibitors (saquinavir, indinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, and tripanavir) in combination or separately. These positively selected mutations introduce significant flexibility in important regions such as the active site cavity and flaps. These mutations were also able to cause changes in accessible solvent area. This study showed that the majority of HIV-1 protease mutants can be grouped into two main classes of protein flexibility behavior. We presented a new approach to study structural changes caused by positively selected mutations in a pathogen protein, for instance the HIV-1 protease and their relationship with their resistance mechanism against known inhibitors. The method can be applied to any pharmaceutically relevant pathogen proteins and could be very useful to understand the effects of positively selected mutations in the context of structural changes."
6699,0.003,3.0,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables on health-related quality of life in women living with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Subjects included 82 women 18 years of age or older who were currently seeking treatment at an outpatient clinic. The Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 20 (SF-20) assessment consisted of patient self-ratings on 20 items measuring six distinct health dimensions. Additional data were collected on age, ethnicity, education, employment status, length of time since HIV diagnosis, CDC stage of disease, total CD4 count, number of symptoms, Karnofsky Performance Scores, social support and discrimination. Multiple regression analyses were performed using each of the six health dimension scores as dependent variables and a combination of ten demographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as independent variables. All of the six multiple regression equations were statistically significant, with R(2) values ranging from 0.35 to 0.44. Age, Karnofsky Performance Score and social support were statistically significantly related to several scale scores (p < 0.05). These results provide baseline data on clinical, demographic and psychosocial determinants of quality of life in a female patient population. Quality of life information can assist programme planners in developing social and medical service delivery for women in the community thus facilitating the development of treatments, programmes and interventions aimed at increasing quality of life for this population."
1355,0.003,3.0,"Non-adherence is one of the major causes of treatment failure which leads to increased morbidity and mortality caused by opportunistic infections. Optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence is essential for maximal suppression of viral replication and long term survival of patients. In order to develop effective public health interventions in the context of scaling ART services to peripheral areas, it is important to evaluate factors associated with non-adherence among HIV-infected individuals in Pwani Region. The purpose of this study was to identify factors related to non-adherence to ART among HIV infected people in Pwani Region eastern of Tanzania. A case-control study was carried out at Tumbi Hospital and Chalinze Health Centre in Pwani Region in eastern Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to assess non-adherence and adherence to doses instruction and time schedule. Patients with less than 95% adherence were defined as cases while those with more than 95% adherence became controls. A structured questionnaire containing factors known to be associated with non-adherence to ART in similar settings was administered. Univariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with non-adherence. A total of 79 cases and 237 controls matched by age and sex were studied. A high proportion of cases and controls (77.2% and 84.8%) had good knowledge ofART benefits, adherence and eligibility. Majority of cases (73.3%) and controls (69.2%) used public transport to access ART services. More than half of cases (53.2%) missed clinic appointments due to lack of bus fare or other reasons and was associated with ART non adherence (mOR 4.2, 95%CI, 2.2-8.1 and 2.1,95%CI 1.2-4.2). Disclosure to confidants only and failure to disclose HIV-test positive status were associated with non adherence (mOR 3.3, 95%CI 1.3-8.5 and 2.3, 95%CI 1.2-7.1). Alcohol use was associated with non adherence to ART (mOR 1.9, 95%CI 1.4-3.7). Patients who were not satisfied with providers were more likely to be non adherence to ART (mOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.2-3.8). In conclusion, these findings show that adherence is a process which is depended on local specific adherence factors. Adherence improvement strategies need to consider site specific adherence determinants, patient experiences and concerns."
2917,0.003,3.0,"Previous reports from India have been limited to the incidences of hepatitis B antigen (HB Ag) in health and disease. This paper reports on a study undertaken over the last two years to determine the incidence of hepatitis B virus infection, the serotypes prevalent among apparently healthy individuals and patients with liver diseases, and the seasonal incidence of sporadic acute hepatitis in this geographic area. The incidences of infection in health and disease show an endemic pattern. The Y subtype predominates among healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases, whereas the D subtype predominates in patients with acute hepatitis. The similarity of subtypes of HB Ag among the majority of healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver diseases suggests that the majority of asymptomatic carriers (subclinically infected) would develop chronic liver disease. The proportion of HB Ag-positive cases of acute hepatitis was significantly higher during the two summer seasons than during the two winter seasons; this could be due to more frequent transmission of the virus by the faecal/urinary-oral route and its activation during the summer months, especially in areas with poor hygienic conditions. The urinary/faecal excretion of virus could thus maintain the natural transmission of the virus in such an environment."
5508,0.003,3.0,"About one-third of vertically HIV-1 infected infants develop AIDS within the first months of life; the remainder show slower disease progression. We investigated the relationship between the pattern of HIV-1 replication early in life and disease outcome in eleven infected infants sequentially studied from birth. Viral load in cells and plasma was measured by highly sensitive competitive PCR-based methods. Although all infants showed an increase in the indices of viral replication within their first weeks of life, three distinct patterns emerged: (a) a rapid increase in plasma viral RNA and cell-associated proviral DNA during the first 4-6 wk, reaching high steady state levels (> 1,000 HIV-1 copies/10(5) PBMC and > 1,000,000 RNA copies/ml plasma) within 2-3 mo of age; (b) a similar initial rapid increase in viral load, followed by a 2.5-50-fold decline in viral levels; (c) a significantly lower (> 10-fold) viral increase during the first 4-6 wk of age. All infants displaying the first pattern developed early AIDS, while infants with slower clinical progression exhibited the second or third pattern. These findings demonstrate that the pattern of viral replication and clearance in the first 2-3 mo of life is strictly correlated with, and predictive of disease evolution in vertically infected infants."
4629,0.003,3.0,"It has been well known that the transmission of HB virus is associated with mass inoculation and other medical procedures. In order to make clear the relation between HBV infection and the mass survey for filariasis on which sera of the examinees were drawn from their earlobes for the detecting of microfilaria with inadequately sterilized instruments, a epidemiological study was conducted in Miyako district. Okinawa prefecture, Japan, in which both HBV infection and filariasis were prevalent. A total of 2,231 inhabitants were investigated for HBV seromarkers. The over all positive rate of HBs antigen was 6.3% with the highest rate of 15.5% in the group of age 25 to 29. On the other hand, the prevalence rate of HBs antibody continued to increase along with age group, and remained to be over 60% after 30 years of age. The positive rates of both HBs antigen and antibody in the subject district were higher than those in other place of Okinawa prefecture or Japan. Comparing yearly attack rates of HBV chronologically, which were calculated from the age-specific HBV exposure rates in the district, the annual incidence of HBV infection was 6.1% (%/year) between 1954 to 1958, 5.2% (%/year) between 1959 to 1963, and then 4.4 (%/year) in the period of 1964 to 1968 in which the proportion of examinees for the survey of filariasis was the highest. In conclusion, the mass survey for filariasis was not the main factor contributing to the high prevalence of HBV infection in Miyako district."
4745,0.003,3.0,"The behavior of hepatitis C in states of immunodeficiency is poorly understood and it is still unclear whether the characteristics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in renal transplant patients differ from those observed in immunocompetent subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the biochemical and histologic characteristics of chronic HCV infection between renal transplant and immunocompetent patients. Forty-one HCV-RNA-positive renal transplant patients and 41 immunocompetent controls matched for gender, age at infection and time of infection were included in the study. The groups were compared regarding laboratory and histologic variables. Renal transplant patients showed lower alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (p = 0.005) and higher levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (p = 0.003), alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.001), and direct bilirubin (p < 0.001) when compared with controls. Histologic analysis revealed less intense portal (p < 0.001) and periportal (p = 0.046) inflammatory infiltrate in renal transplant patients but a larger proportion of cases with confluent necrosis (p = 0.043). No difference in the presence of septal fibrosis, hepatic steatosis, bile duct injury and siderosis was observed. However, there was a difference in the presence of lymphoid aggregates, which were less frequent in the renal transplant group (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the characteristics of hepatitis C in renal transplant patients differ from that observed in immunocompetent patients. In renal transplant patients, HCV infection is biochemically characterized by lower ALT levels and higher frequency of cholestasis. Regarding histology, despite lower frequency of lymphoid aggregates and less intense portal/periportal inflammatory infiltrate, a greater lobular damage was observed. The impact of these differences on the progression of fibrosis remains to be established."
9077,0.003,3.0,"Patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer, healthier lives on highly active antiretroviral therapy and, as a result, interest in kidney transplantation for HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease has increased. HIV is no longer considered a contraindication to solid-organ transplantation and the number of kidney transplants performed in HIV-infected patients each year is increasing steadily. HIV-infected kidney transplant recipients have had excellent outcomes overall, but there are still significant challenges, including high rates of acute rejection, drug-drug interactions, and poor outcomes in patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus. The gap between supply and demand for organs remains a challenge but new developments in HIV-positive to HIV-positive kidney transplantation may help bridge this gap."
7859,0.003,3.0,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a target of treating 3 million people with antiretroviral treatment (ART) by 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients could significantly contribute to this target. ART (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) was initiated in Thyolo district, Malawi, in April 2003, and all HIV-positive TB patients were considered eligible and offered ART. Despite this, only 44 (13%) of 352 TB patients were eventually started on ART by the end of November 2003. Most TB patients leave hospital after 2 weeks to complete the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment (rifampicin-based) in the community, and ART is offered to HIV-positive TB patients after they have started the continuation phase of treatment (isoniazid/ ethambutol). ART is only offered at hospital, while the majority of TB patients take their continuation phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment from health centres. HIV-positive TB patients therefore find it difficult to access ART. In this paper, we discuss a series of options to increase the uptake of ART among HIV-positive TB patients. The main options are: 1) to hospitalise HIV-positive TB patients with a view to starting ART in the continuation phase in hospital; 2) to decentralise ART delivery so ART can be delivered at health centres; 3) to replace nevirapine with efavirenz so ART can be started earlier in the initial phase of anti-tuberculosis treatment. Decentralisation of ART from hospitals to health centres would greatly improve ART access."
406,0.003,3.0,"Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) associated with HIV-1 infection is primarily attributed to deficient T helper (Th)1 immune responses, but most people with active TB have robust Th1 responses, indicating that these are not sufficient to protect against disease. Recent findings suggest that favourable outcomes following Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection arise from finely balanced inflammatory and regulatory pathways, achieving pathogen control without immunopathology. We hypothesised that HIV-1 and antiretroviral therapy (ART) exert widespread changes to cell mediated immunity, which may compromise the optimal host protective response to TB and provide novel insights into the correlates of immune protection and pathogenesis. We sought to define these effects in patients with active TB by transcriptional profiling of tuberculin skin tests (TST) to make comprehensive molecular level assessments of in vivo human immune responses at the site of a standardised mycobacterial challenge. We showed that the TST transcriptome accurately reflects the molecular pathology at the site of human pulmonary TB, and used this approach to investigate immune dysregulation in HIV-1/TB co-infected patients with distinct clinical phenotypes associated with TST reactivity or anergy and unmasking TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after initiation of ART. HIV-1 infected patients with positive TSTs exhibited preserved Th1 responses but deficient immunoregulatory IL10-inducible responses. Those with clinically negative TSTs revealed profound anergy of innate as well as adaptive immune responses, except for preservation of type 1 interferon activity, implicated in impaired anti-mycobacterial immunity. Patients with unmasking TB IRIS showed recovery of Th1 immunity to normal levels, but exaggerated Th2-associated responses specifically. These mechanisms of immune dysregulation were localised to the tissue microenvironment and not evident in peripheral blood. TST molecular profiling categorised different mechanisms of immunological dysfunction in HIV-1 infection beyond the effects on CD4 T cells, each associated with increased risk of TB disease and amenable to host-directed therapies.

1405,0.003,3.0,"We isolated two template analog reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor-resistant mutants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 RT by using the DNA aptamer, RT1t49. The mutations associated, N255D or N265D, displayed low-level resistance to RT1t49, while high-level resistance could be observed when both mutations were present (Dbl). Molecular clones of HIV that contained the mutations produced replication-defective virions. All three RT mutants displayed severe processivity defects. Thus, while biochemical resistance to the DNA aptamer RT1t49 can be generated in vitro via multiple mutations, the overlap between the aptamer- and template-primer-binding pockets favors mutations that also affect the RT-template-primer interaction. Therefore, viruses with such mutations are replication defective. Potent inhibition and a built-in mechanism to render aptamer-resistant viruses replication defective make this an attractive class of inhibitors."
866,0.003,3.0,"Viral Hepatitis is one of the leading causes of disease around the world. In Latin America is a severe public health problem. We conducted a case-control study in the Cayetano Heredia Hospital, Lima-Perú, seeking for risk factors for Hepatitis B infection. We found 0.41% of frequency of HBsAg and 8.13% of anti-HBs in the 492 persons screened. Contact with blood was confirmed as a risk factor for Hepatitis B infection; disposable needle-wash was also identified as a major risk factor. The personnel of the Sterilization Room is also in high risk for the infection. The nurse-aid personnel was also identified as a high risk group. We suggest that the needle wash is a risk factor very easy to remove, and also stopping the rotation of the auxiliary personnel could reduce the incidence of the infection in the personnel at risk."
9885,0.003,3.0,"Although recent data have supported the role of heterosexual activity in the transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in women, studies generating these data have enrolled few black women. We therefore examined black female participants attending our local health department's sexually transmitted disease clinic for the treatment of presumed uncomplicated gonorrhea in serologic and risk-factor surveys of hepatitis B virus infection. Twenty-four (17.6%) of 136 subjects tested had evidence of prior hepatitis B infection. Serologic evidence of hepatitis B infection was significantly associated with three different barometers of sexual activity that included: (1) years of sexual activity (P less than 0.005); (2) history of sexually transmitted disease (P less than 0.02); and (3) number of lifetime heterosexual partners (P less than 0.001). These data provide further support that the quantity of sexual exposure seems to be an important risk factor for hepatitis B infection in heterosexually active females."

Only limited information about the epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection especially in females is available. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies and the possible factors for transmission in the female population of a largely urban city Islamabad. A cross sectional study was conducted from May 2006 to August 2006 in Islamabad. We select 252 female households (n=252) following the selection criteria. The primary outcome variables were HCV seropositivity and factors like history of major surgical procedure, blood transfusion, Intravenous drug use etc. The results showed mean age of the sample was 33.21 (±9.95) years and HCV seropositivity was present in 62 (24.6%) females. Final Forward Stepwise multiple logistic regression showed blood transfusion [OR, 10.094 95% CI 1.950-52.257], dental procedure [OR, 5.381 95% CI 2.315-12.507] and dilation and curettage [OR, 3.869 95% 1.867-8.015] were significantly associated with HCV seropositivity in females.

5547,0.003,3.0,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface small antigen (HBsAg) self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). HBsAg-based VLPs constitute a powerful vector for heterologous immunogenic peptides to develop a safe vaccine delivery system. HBV and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are frequently associated in infection. An HIV-1 class I polyepitope was designed for an HIV-1/HBV vaccine prototype based on HBsAg VLPs. Invariable peptides from the original HIV-1 polyepitope were here permutated to study the influence of epitope order on HIV-1/HBV VLP immunogenicity. Anti-HIV-1 cellular responses were statistically comparable among polyepitope variants. Nevertheless, delivered HIV-1 polyepitopes impacted anti-HBsAg carrier immunogenicity in a polyepitope-specific manner. For a given set of epitopes, the choice of epitope order in polyepitopes is strategic to control immune responses towards HBsAg VLPs used as carrier of foreign immunogenic peptides."

6331,0.003,3.0,"There are few data on drug resistance-associated mutations in the former Soviet Union since, studies have usually been focused on the env or gag genes for subtype information. This study examines the prevalence and patterns of resistance-associated mutations to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors (RTI, PRI) in 278 HIV-1-infected treatment-naïve subjects from countries of Eastern Europe, and defines characteristic polymorphisms of RT and PR sequences in HIV-1 subtype A viruses. Blood samples were collected between 1997 and 2004. Plasma RNA was used for PR-RT amplification by reverse transcription coupled with nested PCR and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was done with neighbor-joining trees and bootscanning. Analysis of drug resistance mutations, with Stanford University HIV Drug Resistance Database's algorithm, resulted in an overall prevalence of 12.9% resistance to RTI and 3.9% to PRI. The most frequent substitutions in the RT region were at positions 62 and 236. V77I substitution in PR was found in 47.8% of samples. Polymorphisms in subtype A sequences were identified. This is the first study reporting the prevalence and patterns of both PRI and RTI resistance-associated mutations in naïve HIV-1 infected patients from the former Soviet Union. These data underline the importance of genotypic resistance testing of chronically HIV-1-infected patients before initiating treatment, in order to select the most suitable drug regimen."

This study aimed to determine the relationship between public perception about HIV/AIDS and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA . The present study was conducted using a descriptive and survey design. Data were collected from 450 patients (236 male and 214 female) in Tehran and Yazd cities. The research instruments were modified HIV-related knowledge/attitude and perception questions about PLWHA, and discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. The results showed that prevalence of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA in the studied population was 60.0%. There was a significant negative correlation between citizens' awareness about HIV/AIDS, HIV-related attitudes, negative perception toward people with HIV/AIDS symptoms and their discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA (p < .01). The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that components of public perception about HIV/AIDS explained for 23.7% of the variance of discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA. Negative public perceptions about HIV/AIDS in Iran associated with discriminatory attitudes toward PLWHA and cultural beliefs in Iran tend to stigmatize and discriminate against the LWHA. "
8353,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (HIV-1) variants were selected for resistance to the (+) and (-) enantiomers of a novel nucleoside analogue, 2'-deoxy-3'-oxa-4'-thio-5-fluorocytidine (dOTFC), by use of the infectious molecular clone HIV HXB2D and the human T-cell line MT-4. The dOTFC-resistant variants that were selected were 10-fold less sensitive than wild-type virus, and cloning and sequencing of the complete reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding region identified the mutation M184V. Studies with mutated recombinant HXB2D virus confirmed the importance of the M184V mutation in conferring resistance to (-)dOTFC in MT-4 cells, although no difference in sensitivity was observed in primary cells. The M184V substitution also displayed decreased susceptibility to (+)dOTFC. Selection with (+)dOTFC also produced variants which were 10-fold more resistant than the wild type, and a novel mutation, D67G, was identified following cloning and sequencing of the RT genes. The D67G mutation was introduced into HXB2D by site-directed mutagenesis, and the data obtained confirmed the importance of this mutation in conferring resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC. Mutated recombinant molecular clone HXB2D-D67G was further selected with (+)dOTFC, and three of six clones sequenced contained both the D67G and M184V mutations, while the other three of the six clones contained only the D67G mutation. Clinical isolates of HIV-1 which are (-) 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine-resistant also displayed resistance to both (+)dOTFC and (-)dOTFC."
1289,0.003,3.0,"Anti-hepatitis Be (HBe) carriers are perceived as having low infectivity, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels far below those seen in the HBeAg carrier. However, the temporal stability of HBV DNA in anti-HBe carriers remains poorly characterised. UK Department of Health guidelines use HBV DNA levels to define whether HBV-infected health care workers may perform exposure-prone procedures. Two samples separated by 1-23 years available from 147 carriers were analysed for precore variants and HBV DNA levels. Among 15 HBeAg carriers, HBV DNA was maintained at high levels. There was a 5 log(10) fold reduction in DNA in 11 individuals who developed anti-HBe during follow-up evaluation. Proportional changes in HBV DNA levels in anti-HBe carriers were similar to those in HBeAg carriers, although there was a trend for changes in viral DNA to be more marked in anti-HBe carriers followed up for longer periods. Closer sampling in 20 anti-HBe carriers demonstrated large fluctuations of DNA levels over short periods. Serum transaminases and precore mutant status at the outset failed to predict those in whom HBV DNA levels fluctuated. HBV DNA was below the detection threshold (<400 copies/ml) in 36 anti-HBe carriers at first sampling and remained so in all but 5 of these carriers. Twelve individuals who were previously viraemic lost detectable HBV DNA during follow-up evaluation. While HBV DNA levels are found to fluctuate in carriers, our results indicate that once below the threshold of detectability, levels are unlikely to rise. This is an important factor when assessing health care workers for exposure-prone procedures."
757,0.003,3.0,"A prospective, cross-sectional study was designed to determine the magnetic resonance relaxation times of cerebral white matter in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. T1 and T2 were estimated at 1.5 T using four-point methods. Seventy-five HIV-1 seropositive subjects, 48 seronegative blood donors, and 17 seronegative homosexual men were studied. Associations between relaxometry and clinical classification, neurological status, immunological status, and qualitative MRI were investigated. Statistically significant differences in white matter T1 relaxation time were found comparing low-risk control and AIDS groups (p < .005), seropositive subjects with neurological signs and those without (p < .005), and subjects with low (CD4 < or = 200 x 10(6)/l) and high (CD4 > 200 x 10(6)/1) CD4 cell counts (p < .05). These findings add to the body of information that reveals no HIV-related change in the brain before the onset of symptomatic immunosuppression and go someway to validating the previous visually rated, qualitative findings. Statistically significant difference in white matter T2 relaxation time were also found comparing the two control groups (p < .005) highlighting the need for appropriate controls."
4246,0.003,3.0,"A panel of 28 insertion mutants of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag precursor (Pr55Gag) was constructed by linker-insertion mutagenesis and expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells. One set of 14 mutants carried the normal N-myristylation signal; the other set constituted their non-N-myristylated counterparts. The mutants were characterized with respect to (i) assembly and extracellular release of membrane-enveloped budding Gag particles, (ii) intracellular assembly and nuclear transport of Gag cores, (iii) specific processing of Pr55Gag by HIV-1 protease in vivo, and (iv) binding of Pr55Gag to an HIV-1 genomic RNA probe in Northwestern blotting. Insertions within the region between amino acid residues 209 and 334 in the CA domain appeared to be the most detrimental to Gag particle assembly and release of Gag into the external medium, whereas a narrower window, between residues 209 and 241, was found to be critical for secretion of soluble Pr55Gag. Differences in Pr55Gag processing in vivo and RNA binding in vitro between N-myristylated and non-N-myristylated Gag mutants suggested a major conformational role for the myristylated N terminus of Gag precursor. In coinfection experiments using wild-type Gag- and mutant Gag-expressing recombinants, a transdominant negative effect on Gag particle assembly and release was observed for insertions located in two separate domains, the matrix and nucleocapsid."

1908,0.003,3.0,"The goal of the study was to improve the methodology of HIV genotyping for analysis of HIV drug resistance and HIV clustering. Using the protocol of Gall et al. (A. Gall, B. Ferns, C. Morris, S. Watson, M. Cotten, M. Robinson, N. Berry, D. Pillay, and P. Kellam, J Clin Microbiol 50:3838-3844, 2012, doi:10.1128/JCM.01516-12), we developed a robust methodology for amplification of two large fragments of viral genome covering about 80% of the unique HIV-1 genome sequence. Importantly, this method can be applied to both viral RNA and proviral DNA amplification templates, allowing genotyping in HIV-infected subjects with suppressed viral loads (e.g., subjects on antiretroviral therapy [ART]). The two amplicons cover critical regions across the HIV-1 genome (including pol and env), allowing analysis of mutations associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs]), integrase strand transfer inhibitors, and virus entry inhibitors. The two amplicons generated span 7,124 bp, providing substantial sequence length and numbers of informative sites for comprehensive phylogenic analysis and greater refinement of viral linkage analyses in HIV prevention studies. The long-range HIV genotyping from proviral DNA was successful in about 90% of 212 targeted blood specimens collected in a cohort where the majority of patients had suppressed viral loads, including 65% of patients with undetectable levels of HIV-1 RNA loads. The generated amplicons could be sequenced by different methods, such as population Sanger sequencing, single-genome sequencing, or next-generation ultradeep sequencing. The developed method is cost-effective-the cost of the long-range HIV genotyping is under $140 per subject (by Sanger sequencing)-and has the potential to enable the scale up of public health HIV prevention interventions.

5351,0.003,3.0,"Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group protocol 316 was an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial comparing single-dose oral nevirapine (200 mg to mother and 2 mg/kg to infant) with placebo in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women receiving standard antiretroviral therapy. This substudy evaluated the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations at 6 weeks postpartum in a subgroup of participants. Maternal risk factors for the emergence of nevirapine-resistance mutations were evaluated. Mutations associated with nevirapine resistance were detectable at delivery, prior to receipt of study drug, in 5 (2.3%) of 217 women. Fourteen (15%; 95% confidence interval, 8%-23%) of 95 women who received intrapartum nevirapine developed a nevirapine-resistance mutation 6 weeks postpartum. The most common mutation was K103N, which was present in 10 women. The risk for development of a new nevirapine-resistance mutation did not correlate with CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA load at delivery or with type of antepartum antiretroviral therapy. The risk of nevirapine resistance should be considered when determining the risks or benefits of intrapartum nevirapine in women receiving antepartum antiretroviral therapy."

4454,0.003,3.0,"Liver fibrosis is common, particularly in individuals who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV-infected individuals have excess congestive heart failure (CHF) risk compared with uninfected people. It remains unknown whether liver fibrosis stage influences the CHF risk or if HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection modifies this association. Our objectives were to assess whether 1) stage of liver fibrosis is independently associated with incident CHF and 2) the association between stage of liver fibrosis and incident CHF is modified by HIV/HCV status. Participants alive on or after April 1, 2003, in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study were included. Those without prevalent cardiovascular disease were followed until their first CHF event, death, last follow-up date, or December 31, 2011. Liver fibrosis was measured using the fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), which is calculated using age, aminotransferases, and platelets. Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors. Among 96,373 participants over 6.9 years, 3844 incident CHF events occurred. FIB-4 between 1.45 and 3.25 (moderate fibrosis) and FIB-4 > 3.25 (advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis) were associated with CHF (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.17 [1.07-1.27] and 1.65 [1.43-1.92], respectively).

Only limited information is available on the outcome of coinfected patients after liver transplantation. We studied survival rates of 204 patients with viral hepatitis transplanted at our center between 1972 and 1997. HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections were present in 23 and nine individuals, respectively, while 97 patients had monoinfection by HCV and 75 had HBV monoinfection. Survival of coinfected patients was significantly longer than that of monoinfected patients (14.4 +/- 0.9 vs. 8.5 +/- 0.6 yr; p = 0.0003). The same was true for graft survival (p = 0.0002). In Cox's regression, viral coinfection (p = 0.0001), absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.00001) and no retransplantation (p = 0.02) were independently associated with patient survival. After exclusion of patients with HCC (n = 62), survival of coinfected patients was still significantly longer than that of monoinfected individuals (p = 0.002). The improved outcome was similar for both HBV/HDV and HBV/HCV coinfections. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, individuals with multiple hepatitis virus infections had an improved outcome after liver transplantation. Thus, viral coinfections may be associated with ameliorated courses of diseases under certain conditions."

To establish the prevalence of HDV infection in haemophilic patients and patients without haemophilia, 87 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were examined for serological evidence of delta hepatitis. In addition HBV, HDV and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) infection markers were compared to clinical and histopathological outcome of hepatitis. Out of 46 haemophiliacs 30 (65%) were anti-HD-seropositive; 10 out of 30 anti-HD-positive patients (33%) had pathological liver function tests compared to 2 out of 16 anti-HD-negative haemophiliacs (13%). The rate of HIV infection did not differ between the HDV infected and the non-HDV infected individuals with haemophilia (17/27 anti-HD-positive patients versus 12/16 anti-HD-negative patients). Two haemophilic anti-HD-positive patients underwent liver biopsy, in both cases hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) was detected in the biopsies. Only 2 out of 41 patients without haemophilia were anti-HD-positive. Both had pathological liver function tests; chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, respectively, were diagnosed and HDAg was found in the liver biopsies. Out of 39 anti-HD-seronegative patients without haemophilia, 26 (67%) were hepatitis B e antigen positive; in the sera of 20 patients (51%) HBV-DNA was demonstrated, but only 6 patients (15%) had pathological liver function tests. In conclusion a high seroprevalence of HDV infection was found in haemophilic patients treated with non-pasteurized commercial clotting factor concentrates. An endemic spreading of HDV infection in patients without haemophilia with chronic HBV infection could not be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
5484,0.003,3.0,"Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a known complication during and after anti-cancer therapy. This condition can affect two patient populations: it is most commonly seen in patients who are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but it is also being increasingly reported among patients who are HBsAg-negative but who have prior infection, as evident by seropositive status for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), irrespective of their anti-HBs (antibody to HBsAg) status. The clinical course can vary from asymptomatic hepatitis to fulminant hepatic failure that can be potentially fatal. With the increasing use of biological agents in addition to potent cytotoxic chemotherapy in the armamentarium of anti-cancer treatments, reactivation of hepatitis B has become a common clinical situation that is faced by both oncologists and hepatologists especially in HBV endemic areas. In this review, we discuss the clinical course of reactivation in the two HBV-infected sub-populations, and the role of anti-virals in the prevention and management of HBV reactivation in association with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological therapies."
4554,0.003,3.0,"Analysis of the preS1 gene of hepatitis B virus was used to define two nosocomial outbreaks of HBV infection. In an outbreak in an oncology unit we had previously shown by single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of a 189 bp fragment of the preS1 gene, that 52 children were infected with HBV strains that displayed only 5 different SSCP profiles. Sequencing of a 383 bp fragment encompassing the entire preS1 gene, revealed that isolates with same SSCP profile were identical in sequence across the entire preS1 gene, confirming that those patients with the same SSCP pattern had epidemiologically linked infections. A second outbreak involved 8 liver transplant patients from two different hospitals, 5 of whom were from the same hospital at which the oncology outbreak had occurred. Two of these 5 patients had HBV strains that were identical to strains from the oncology unit and nosocomial transmission probably accounted for the infections in these two, while diversity of both SSCP profiles and sequence data of remaining 6 patients supported the conclusion that they had not been infected from a common source. The donor liver is believed to be the most likely source of infection in these patients. HBV isolates from patients infected in the community were used as a standard for the general degree of preS1 sequence variation of local HBV strains. Phylogenetic analysis and comparison with reference HBV clones revealed that of 27 local HBV strains, genotypes A and D occurred most frequently and were identified in 14 and 12 patients respectively, while genotype C was detected in one patient."

Nine had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody. Travel to the United States, homosexual relations with United States nationals in Panama, and sexual contacts in Panamanian clubs and bars were associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection by logistic regression analysis. Number of different male sex partners per year was identified but did not enter the logistic model at a significant level. To estimate seroprevalence in other high risk populations, 183 Panama City female prostitutes and 55 homosexual males from the rural Azuero peninsula were screened; none were seropositive.

No evidence of liver enzyme elevations were seen, even in 66 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. Given that TDF is an adenosine analogue, like didanosine, exposure to ribavirin might increase intracellular phosphorylated TDF metabolites, which could result in a higher risk of nephrotoxicity.

To examine this issue, we studied 50 NANB FHF patients and 104 liver transplant recipients from North America and Europe. Hepatic DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus I (HSV I) and II (HSV II), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) nucleic acid sequences. The prevalence of HBV was assessed in North American subjects only. HSV I, HSV II, VZV, and HHV-6 viral sequences were not observed in any samples. Three of 50 FHF (6%) and 14 of 104 control patients (13%) were positive for CMV DNA. Two of 50 FHF (4%) and 10 of 104 control patients (10%) had EBV DNA, and HBV DNA was observed in 3 of 10 North American FHF patients (30%) and 3 of 59 controls (5%) without serum markers for HBV infection. The finding of HBV DNA in the liver of seronegative controls from North America but not Europe suggests that occult hepatitis B sequences in patients with NANB FHF may simply reflect geographic differences. The majority of cryptogenic FHF cases cannot be attributed to infection with herpes viruses or HBV."
1761,0.003,3.0,"The sera from 16 individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at different clinical stages were evaluated for antibody-dependent neutralization and/or enhancement of infectivity by HIV. The HIV isolate from each individual (homotypic) and established laboratory strains showing broad cellular host range and cytopathicity were used. All sera could neutralize one of the laboratory-passaged isolates, whereas only two could neutralize the corresponding homotypic strain. Seven homotypic isolates were enhanced by serum from the respective individual. This activity was primarily observed in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Moreover, the tropism for macrophages of four of these seven viral isolates was found to be enhanced by the homotypic sera. Finally, sequential pairs of HIV and sera obtained from five HIV-infected individuals with different clinical progression were studied over time. The enhancing activity of three of the five sera appeared to increase over time, indicating changes in both the host virus population and the type of antibodies produced. These results suggest that enhancing antibodies contribute to the spread and pathogenesis of HIV in vivo. They emphasize the necessity of studying further the association of enhancing antibodies and disease progression in infected individuals."

We report a 28-year-old woman who presented with Candida oesophagitis with underlying chronic hepatitis C. The patient presented with anorexia and weakness and was noted to have raised serum transaminases. Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed Candida oesophagitis involving the whole oesophagus. Oesophageal biopsy demonstrated changes consistent with Candida oesophagitis. Serology was positive for hepatitis C antibodies, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyped hepatitis C virus (HCV) as genotype 3. Liver biopsy revealed chronic hepatitis with moderately active portal inflammation. A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was non-reactive for types 1 and 2. The development of Candida oesophagitis in a patient with chronic HCV infection demands prompt consideration of general debility and immunosuppression as effects of HCV that led to an occurrence of opportunistic infection. Evaluation of this case provides insight into various mechanisms of immune suppression associated with HCV infection."

Although HIV co-infection clearly accelerates progression of HCV-related fibrosis and liver disease, controversy remains as to the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression in co-infected patients. HIV can cause immune dysfunction, in which the regulatory function of T helper (Th) cells is very essential. Moreover, cytokines derived from Th cells play a prominent role in viral infection. Investigating the functional changes of Th1 and Th2 cells in cytokine level can improve the understanding of the effect of co-infected HCV on HIV infection."

Statistical analysis of the case studies shows 120/cumm median CD4+ blood cell count, and the OIs showed an inversely proportional occurrence to the CD4+ count of the immunocompromised patients. The spectrum and frequency of certain OIs highlight the urgency of studying HIV/AIDS in resource-limited countries where locally specific disease patterns may be observed. The purpose of the present investigation was the identification of such opportunistic pathogens, as we feel the HIV epidemic can be more effectively managed if physicians and health planners are aware of this information."
1631,0.003,3.0,"Apathy is a prominent neuropsychiatric symptom associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The increased frequency of apathy in this population may reflect the direct involvement of the virus on the central nervous system (CNS), but the severity of apathy has not been shown to consistently relate to markers of disease activity or other neuropsychiatric complications of the virus. We examined the relationship between ratings of apathy and performance on measures of cognitive function and immune system status in a sample of HIV-infected patients. Apathy was significantly elevated among HIV-infected individuals compared to healthy comparison subjects. Apathy was significantly related to performance on measures of learning efficiency and a measure of cognitive flexibility. Ratings of apathy did not relate to CD4 cell count, but they were associated with disease duration. In addition, ratings of depression were independent of ratings of apathy. These findings suggest that apathy does not co-vary with a proxy measure of active disease status, but apathy does relate to several measures of cognitive dysfunction in patients with HIV. As such, the increased prevalence of apathy among HIV-infected adults may reflect HIV-associated neurologic dysfunction."
9104,0.003,3.0,"Monocytes and brain macrophage-microglial cells are thought to play a crucial role in the neurologic dysfunction associated with HIV-1 disease. Since neopterin is produced by monocytes-macrophages, we asked whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin levels increase before the onset of HIV-1 neurologic disease and whether they correlate with other CSF and peripheral blood immunologic parameters. In this study, CSF neopterin levels from 159 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive persons were found to increase as the blood CD4+ T-cell count decreased and as CSF IgG, IgG synthesis, IgG index, and beta 2-microglobulin increased. Neopterin levels in the CSF exceeded those in the serum in 32% of patients, while 25% had CSF levels > 13.5 nmol/liter. CSF neopterin levels vary with immune status, may reflect intrathecal production, and can be elevated in asymptomatic HIV-positive patients with normal neurologic examinations. Long-term follow-up of this patient population should be able to define the clinical correlation between CSF neopterin levels during the asymptomatic phase of HIV-1 disease and the risk of subsequent neurologic disease."
9894,0.003,3.0,"Antiretroviral therapy has dramatically reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In 1988, the suggestion that the first antiretroviral drug, zidovudine, was the potential cause of muscle pathology in HIV-infected persons resulted in structural and biochemical patient studies demonstrating acquired mitochondrial dysfunction. Assessment of subsequent nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) antiretroviral drugs has indicated that mitochondria are a common target of NRTI toxicity in multiple tissues, leading to a wide variety of pathology ranging from lipodystrophy to neuropathy. Overwhelmingly, these complications have emerged during post-licensing human studies. Subsequent animal and in vitro studies have then elucidated the potential pathological mechanisms, suggesting that NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity arises principally from inhibition of the sole mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma, leading to a reduction in mtDNA content (depletion). Millions of patients have been treated with mitochondrially toxic NRTIs and these drugs remain the backbone of antiretroviral rollout in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Here we describe the 25-year history of antiretroviral associated mitochondrial pathology and critically review the strength of evidence linking clinical, histopathological, and molecular data. We discuss recently described novel mechanisms of NRTI-associated mitochondrial damage and whether or not recently licensed NRTIs may be considered free from mitochondrial toxicity. "
2898,0.003,3.0,"It was demonstrated that combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) reduces the HIV-1 viral load (VL) in the blood and the seminal compartment. Some studies have reported that the seminal HIV-1 VL is undetectable in individuals with an undetectable blood plasma viral load (bpVL) under cART. However, some recent studies have demonstrated that seminal HIV-1 RNA may still be detected, and potentially infectious, even in the case of an undetectable bpVL. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the detection rate of a seminal VL and whether shedding could be intermittent over a very short time. From January 2006 to December 2011, 88 HIV-1 infected men, enrolled in an Assisted Reproduction program, provided 306 semen samples, corresponding to 177 frozen sperm samples (two samples delivered at a one-hour interval (n = 129) or one sample (n = 48)). All enrolled men were under cART, with an undetectable bpVL for more than 6 months. HIV-1 RNA was quantified in seminal plasma using a Roche COBAS Ampliprep COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 test. Seminal HIV-1 RNA was detected in 23 samples (7.5%) from 17 patients (19.3%). This detection rate was stable over years. With regards to the freezing of two samples delivered at a one-hour interval, the proportion of discordance between the first and second samples was 9.3% (12/129). Our results confirm the intermittent shedding of HIV-1 in semen. While this finding has been shown by studies examining longer time intervals, to our knowledge, this has never been demonstrated over such a short time interval. "

Its action on natural killer (NK) cell activity has not yet been studied in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo effects of the drug on NK cell activity have been determined in six patients with chronic HBV hepatitis and in ten healthy control subjects. Two methods were used: an enzyme release assay and a cytotoxicity test based on the assessment of endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity of the target cells. The in vitro effect of the drug was assessed using cianidanol at 10(-6), 10(-5) and 10(-4) M concentrations. For in vivo studies, HBV hepatitis patients were treated with cianidanol at a daily dose of 3.0 g cianidanol for seven days and were investigated before and after the treatment. Chronic HBV hepatitis patients showed a moderate decrease in NK cell activity compared to the controls, but after the cianidanol therapy their NK cell activity significantly rose to 68.0% +/- 9.5% (p less than 0.01). Cianidanol in vitro inhibited the NK cell activity both in hepatitis and healthy groups when using K-562 target cells and the lactic acid dehydrogenase enzyme release assay, but did not influence or even slightly enhance the NK activity when human embryonic fibroblast cells and alkaline phosphatase assay were used for the test. After the 7-day in vivo treatment, the in vitro inhibitory action of the drug was diminished or absent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
4542,0.003,3.0,"One hundred sequences of HIV-1 protease with the two flanking cleavage sites from 10 antiretroviral drug-treated Thai patients were examined for residue variability and for mutations at positions associated with the resistance to protease inhibitors. Seven patients were infected with CRF01_AE, two with subtype B, and one with a strain that did not belong to any of the currently identified subtypes or recombinant forms. A total of 46 out of the 99 positions (46%) in HIV-1 protease showed at least one amino acid change as compared with the HXB2 subtype B protease. Interestingly, 35% of these mutations were at positions associated with resistance to the PIs. The observation indicated that the viral protease is flexible in tolerating some degree of amino acid substitutions even in the critical regions under the selective pressure driven by antiretroviral drugs. The PR/RT cleavage site revealed conservation of the HXB2 sequence. Nevertheless, the p6*/PR cleavage site displayed variability, notably in the p6* region."

The recognition of the HLA-DQ-restricted epitope by this clone was further defined by using overlapping synthetic peptides. The epitope recognized by this CD4+ CTL clone (amino acids 140 to 148) overlaps with a CD8+ epitope and is highly conserved among all isolates of HIV type 1 that have been sequenced.

9585,0.003,3.0,"Approximately 350 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), representing a significant public health challenge. Nucleos/tide analogues (NUCs) and interferon alpha (IFNα), the current standard of care for chronic infection, aim at preventing progression of the disease to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. However, in contrast to the case of hepatitis C virus infection, in which novel antiviral drugs cure the vast majority of treated patients, in regard to HBV, cure is rare due to the unusual persistence of viral DNA in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nucleus of infected cells. Available therapies for HBV require lifelong treatment and surveillance, as reactivation frequently occurs following medication cessation and the occurrence of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, even after years of successful viral suppression. Progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics, and it is likely that only a combination of immune modulators, inhibitors of gene expression and replication and cccDNA-targeting drugs will eradicate chronic infection. This review aims to summarize the state of the art in HBV drug research highlighting those agents with the greatest potential for success based on in vitro as well as on data from clinical studies."
4468,0.003,3.0,"The importance of CD8+ T-cell responses in the control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been demonstrated, yet few studies have been able to correlate these responses with markers of HIV-1 disease progression. This study measured cell-mediated immune responses using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 27 patients with chronic HIV-1 infection, the majority of whom were off antiretroviral therapy. The ELISPOT assay was used to detect gamma interferon-secreting PBMC after stimulation with overlapping HIV-1 peptides spanning the Gag, Pol, Env, and Nef proteins in addition to the baculovirus-derived p24 and gp160 proteins. All volunteers had responses to at least one HIV-1-specific peptide. All but one of the subjects (96%) responded to the Gag peptide pool, and 86% responded to the Pol and/or Nef peptide pools. The magnitude and the breadth of T-cell responses directed to either the Gag or p24 peptide pools correlated inversely with viral load in plasma (r = -0.60, P < 0.001 and r = -0.52, P < 0.005, respectively) and directly with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.54, P < 0.01 and r = 0.39, P < 0.05, respectively) using the Spearman rank correlation test. Responses to the Pol and integrase peptide pools also correlated with absolute CD4+ T-cell counts (r = 0.45, P < 0.05 and r = 0.49, P < 0.01, respectively). No correlation with markers of disease progression was seen with specific T-cell responses directed toward the Env or Nef peptides. These data serve as strong evidence that major histocompatibility complex class I presentation of Gag peptides is an essential feature for any HIV-1 vaccine designed to elicit optimal CD8+ T-cell responses."
8686,0.003,3.0,"Isolates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) derived from the central nervous system (CNS) display properties distinctive from blood-derived isolates, including a high incidence of macrophage tropism in CNS isolates. Macrophage tropism is a result, in part, of DNA sequence variation in the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gene, but evidence also exists suggesting differences in the long terminal repeat (LTR) may contribute to differential gene expression. To investigate the nature of HIV-1 LTR sequence variation in the brain, we have sequenced bases -374 to +43 of the LTR from the brains of four HIV-1-infected patients. A total of 56 clones were derived from either both gray and white matter (three brains) or white matter alone (one brain), and these sequences were compared to 17 published sequences derived from multiple sources. A total of five LTR quasispecies were found. Overall, there was a significant amount of sequence variation both within and between brains, comparable to that seen in quasispecies of the envelope glycoprotein derived from blood or brain. The vast majority of the variation was seen in regions upstream from the two NF-kappa B sites. Compared to the blood-derived, T cell-tropic IIIB LTR, a majority of clones from two or more of the brains shared 11 unique substitutions in transcription factor binding sites, of which eight were shared with the CNS-derived clones JR-CSF and JR-FL and altered the NF-AT and LEF-1 transcription factor binding sites. These findings correlate with published functional studies showing CNS-derived HIV-1 LTRs are distinct from the blood-derived IIIB LTR, and represent a starting point for future studies designed to determine which LTR sequence variations are associated with cell-specific differences in gene expression in the CNS."
5101,0.003,3.0,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs12979860 and rs8099917 near the interleukin 28B gene are predictors of virological response (SVR) to IFN-based therapy for monoinfected chronic hepatitis C patients. We retrospectively evaluated the impact of IL28B SNPs and other factors on SVR in a cohort of 102 HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients treated with pegylated interferon-? (peg-INF?) and ribavirin. Data on baseline features and virological response at different time-points were collected. Overall, 89/102 patients (87%) were males, 44 (43%) of whom infected with HCV genotype 1; SVR was achieved by 50 patients (49%). A univariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that rs129679860 SNP genotype CC (p<0.034), rs8099917 SNP genotype TT (p<0.01), HCV genotype 2 or 3 (p<0.0001), low HCV viral load (p<0.028) and RVR (rapid virological response) (p<0.0001) were associated with a higher likelihood of SVR. Multivariate analysis confirmed only RVR and HCV genotype as independent predictors of SVR. In a real life setting, the importance of RVR and IL28B SNPs was confirmed as predictive of SVR to identify patients with a higher likelihood of SVR to Peg-INF?+RBV, and also to designate a deferred therapy for patients with a low likelihood of SVR for whom it is preferable to wait for more successful options.

8095,0.003,3.0,"Splenectomy has been reported to alter inconsistently the CD4 lymphocyte numbers in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To further assess the effect of splenectomy we have retrospectively examined the charts of 10 patients who were infected with HIV and who had undergone splenectomy. There was a significant increase in the mean CD4 numbers following splenectomy (mean increase of 326/microliters, or 2.1-fold, P = 0.0009), the total lymphocyte numbers (mean increase of 1.55/ml, or 2.2-fold, P = 0.001) and in the CD8 lymphocyte count (mean increase of 968/microliters, or 2.3-fold, P = 0.014). No significant difference was observed in the percentage CD4 lymphocytes (P = 0.95) or in the CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.76). In two patients, symptoms suggestive of impaired immune function developed post-splenectomy, at a time when their CD4 lymphocyte numbers were markedly higher than their pre-splenectomy values. One developed oral candidiasis (CD4 960/microliters, percentage CD4 32%), and in one patient a 7 kg weight loss was associated with recurrent mouth ulcers (CD4 680/microliters, percentage CD4 7%). We conclude that the total CD4 count increases significantly after splenectomy while the percentage CD4 lymphocyte count and CD4:CD8 lymphocyte ratio do not. Our data suggest that the CD4 lymphocyte count overestimates the immune function in these patients, although our findings are not conclusive."

In this study semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is compared with a new branched DNA signal amplification methodology. Samples from HCV-infected patients as well as from human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase PCR correlated well with the branched DNA assay (r = 0.7036, P < 0.05). HCV RNA was found to occur at significantly higher titers (P < 0.05) in patients coinfected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with titers in those infected with HCV alone.

The goal of this study was to compare survival durations of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected IDUs for the period 1987-2004.Methods. Demographic data, drug use characteristics, and biological markers were obtained at the time of admission to a substance abuse treatment program. The outcome of interest was the duration of survival after admission, and the primary exposure was HIV infection. Vital status was ascertained by means of the mortality register by the end of 2004. Three calendar periods, which were defined on the basis of use of specific therapies, were considered: 1987-1991 (the antiretroviral monotherapy era), 1992-1996 (the dual combination therapy era and the era when methadone was introduced in Spain), and 1997-2004 (the era of HAART and of established methadone programs). We used Cox regression methods allowing for late entries to handle the contribution of persons who survived a given period and entered the following period with nonzero time. We compared HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected IDUs with adjustments for age, sex, and duration of follow-up after admission."
3651,0.003,3.0,"A sero-epidemiological survey of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a randomly selected sample of 957 persons from the population of the Austral Island group in French Polynesia was conducted as a first step before developing an immunization programme strategy. Prevalence rates of HBsAg ranged from 3.09% to 27% in the different islands of the group with a weighted mean of 10.48%, while the prevalence rate for at least one marker ranged from 46.91% to 81.03% with a weighted mean of 64.12%. In the 0-11 months and 1-4 years age groups, 2.08% and 10.57%, respectively, of the children were HBsAg carriers. These findings, when compared to the mean population carrier rate of 10.48%, suggest that HBV transmission occurred mostly after the first year of life. The highest prevalence rate for HBeAg positivity was in the 5-19 years age group (more than 40% of the HBsAg carriers were HBeAg positive), suggesting that contagiousness was greatest in childhood and adolescence. HBsAg was found in 11.45% of women of child-bearing age and HBeAg in 19.09% of women positive for HBsAg. It is concluded that immunization of newborns and infants, using vaccine alone, should be the most effective strategy for reducing HBV infection in the Austral Islands archipelago."

Although this is an improvement over previous years, significant operational challenges have inhibited progress toward universal access to HIV care and treatment. Despite these challenges, the intense efforts focused on addressing the HIV epidemic present an opportunity for overall health systems improvement in developing nations. In October 2006, Harvard University's Centers for AIDS Research, the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, the Department of Health of KwaZulu-Natal, and the Medical Research Council of South Africa held a conference entitled ""The Realities of Antiretroviral Therapy Rollout: Challenges to Successful Programmatic Implementation"" in Durban, South Africa.

However, little is known about the characteristics of substance abuse and its impact on medication adherence among HIV-positive women with a history of child sexual abuse (CSA). In the present study, 148 HIV-positive women with a history of CSA completed a structured interview assessing CSA severity, psychological status, substance abuse, medication adherence, and sexual decision-making. Severity of CSA was significantly associated with substance use but not with adherence. Participants who had used hard drugs and who had lower self-esteem and adherence self-efficacy reported significantly lower levels of adherence. Additional research on how CSA experiences impact health behaviors is needed to help develop culturally congruent interventions to reduce risk behaviors and facilitate better medication adherence for this vulnerable population."
7977,0.003,3.0,"Renal disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent comorbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The increase in life expectancy following the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the long-term development of metabolic complications (such as diabetes and dyslipidaemia), hypertension, and vascular diseases can contribute to the increasing frequency in the recognition of renal impairment in HIV-infected patients. Some antiretroviral agents, and particularly tenofovir, have been associated with nephrotoxic drug effects, including decline in glomerular filtration rate, proximal tubular damage, and acute kidney injury. The occurrence of clinically evident renal toxicity in patients treated with HAART seems to be very low, but glomerular or tubular subclinical dysfunction may occur more frequently. Therefore, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring for the early recognition of renal abnormalities is recommended for all subjects receiving antiretroviral treatment. In this article, the current knowledge about the nephrotoxic effects of antiretroviral agents has been reviewed, and an algorithm for screening and management of HAART-related kidney disease is proposed in the light of the most recent clinical studies and international guidelines."

Program participants showed significant improvement over comparison group participants on measures of HIV/AIDS and treatment-related knowledge and recognition and understanding of HIV terms. Although there were no significant changes in adherence mastery and behaviors during the 6-week follow up period, there were significant changes in program participants' knowledge about medication adherence. Future steps to examine the sustainability of the program in the medical management of patients are planned in addition to determining its long-range relative impact."
7790,0.003,3.0,"Sargramostim is a yeast-derived, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor with therapeutic potential in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Its safety and activity when used in combination with protease inhibitors were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial in which 20 HIV-infected subjects on stable antiretroviral regimens, including indinavir or ritonavir, received sargramostim or placebo 3 times a week for 8 weeks. Analysis of HIV virus load excluded any 0. 5 log10 increase due to sargramostim (95% confidence interval, -0.68 to 0.44). Sargramostim was well tolerated, and inflammatory cytokines and surrogate markers of disease progression, such as serum levels of interleukin-10 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors types Iota and IotaIota, remained stable in subjects receiving sargramostim. Sargramostim treatment was associated with a trend toward decreased HIV RNA (>0.5 log10) and increased CD4+ cell count (>30%). These results became statistically significant only when subjects with baseline virus loads within the limits of detection or baseline CD4 cell count >50 were analyzed. No difference in indinavir pharmacokinetics was observed before or after sargramostim therapy."
8945,0.003,3.0,"A total of 82 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-specific cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones were isolated and characterized from 5 HIV-infected subjects, utilizing multiple HLA class I alleles. B62-restricted, HIV-1 gag-specific CTL clones isolated from a single blood sample from 1 subject used four different Vbeta gene rearrangements. Multiple CTL clones could be isolated from the same time point directed against HIV-1 gag, nef, and env from 1 subject. A prospective analysis resulted in the isolation of CTL clones from 1 subject directed against multiple HIV-1 antigens, including the same highly conserved nef peptide, over a 1-year period, in the absence of detectable circulating viral plasma RNA. These data suggest that in some persons without clinical progression and low levels of circulating HIV-1, the CTL response is polyclonal, is directed against multiple HIV-1 proteins, including highly conserved peptides within these proteins, and is maintained over time."
8714,0.003,3.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the infectious agent of both acute and chronic hepatitis. HBV exists in multiple genotypic variants that differ in their capacity to become persistent chronic infections and in their clinical manifestations, including hepatocellular carcinoma. The 8 genotypes (A-H) of HBV show a specific worldwide geographic distribution and are correlated with different disease course, severity, and response to therapy. We isolated DNA from 75 HBV-positive blood donors, chosen randomly from the database of the National Blood Bank in Tirana, to specifically analyze the UGT1A1 polymorphism to determine its correlations with bilirubin levels and liver function. The large number of subjects who were HBV-positive carriers of heterozygosis or homozygosis for the UGT1A1*28 (TA)7 polymorphism suggests that these individuals may be more susceptible to cancer and should follow a strict regime of prevention.

We present here an analysis of patients recorded in the cohort database between 1st of January 2006 and 31st of December 2008. During that period, 11982 patients were under medical follow-up in Belgium. Sixty-one percent of the patients were male and the median age was 39.8 at the time of first recorded viral load. Among the patients whose nationality or probable mode of transmission was recorded, nearly half (48.0%) were Belgian and 38.3% originated from Sub-Saharan Africa; heterosexual contacts were reported in the majority of cases (56.0%) followed by homosexual contacts (35.3%). A total of 145 deaths were reported. Around three quarters of the patients were on ART. The median CD4 cell count rose from 470 cells/mm3 in 2006 to 501 cells/mm3 in 2008. This cohort enabled us to obtain comprehensive information on the numbers and characteristics of HIV-infected patients currently being followed up in Belgium, and on trends in antiretroviral therapy and biological results. This will serve for planning purposes, evaluation of access to care and as a source of information for further studies."
1993,0.003,3.0,"We analyzed hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes obtained from serum samples and liver biopsy specimen of a chronic HBsAg/anti-HBe carrier with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Before the liver biopsy, performed at the time of HCC diagnosis, the patient had been followed for 2 years; the serum samples collected in that period resulted negative for HBV-DNA dot blot hybridization. The hepatic DNA was at first examined by Southern blot, but no HBV sequence was detected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification revealed the presence of HBV genomes in DNA extracted from the liver tissue and from two serum samples collected, respectively, 1 and 2 years before the biopsy. Direct sequence of the amplified preC/C and preS regions showed that the viral populations present in serum and liver were identical and that they had a 34 nucleotide deletion in the preS2 region, while the preC region presented two mutations each introducing a translational stop codon, one at the carboxy terminal end and the other at the second codon of the region, both able to prevent HBeAg expression. These results identify a new HBV variant which was selected during a chronic infection, and had very low levels of replication as shown by its detection only after PCR amplification."
9414,0.003,3.0,"The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among acute burn patients and its impacts on patient's outcomes in an Iranian burn care hospital. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary burn care hospital in Iran, retrospectively reviewing the data records of all patients admitted between February 2011 and February 2012. The HIV status of all the patients was assessed in relation to clinical outcomes and the patient's prognosis. A total of 969 patients were included in this study. Five patients (0·5%) were HIV positive, and all of them were male. Mean burn area was significantly larger in HIV-positive patients than the healthy group (P < 0·05). HIV-positive patients had a longer period of hospitalisation than HIV-negative patients (23·2 ± 16·3 versus 13·1 ± 14·6, P = 0·008). Nonetheless, the average number of procedures and the mortality rate did not significantly differ between the study groups (P > 0·05). Comparison of age, sex and burn extent between HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative cases also revealed similar results. Prevalence of HIV infection among our burn population was 0·5%; thus, HIV status may be related with more extensive injuries and longer hospital stays."

Homosexual or bisexual males (n = 65) with chronic HBV infection attending The Middlesex Hospital, London were studied, of whom two had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease. HBV DNA was amplified from 62 of 65 serum samples using nested and double nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Direct sequencing of the PCR products was employed to investigate sequence variation. HBV-DNA from all available HBeAg-negative (n = 9) and selected HBeAg-positive (n = 33) sera were sequenced in the entire precore gene, the 3' terminal portion of the X gene (aa128-154), and the 5' terminus of the core gene (aa18-73). Sequences were highly conserved in all regions studied. Samples from two anti-HBe-seropositive patients contained mutations in the precore region. In one, a single mutation in the first amino acid resulted in a change to leucine, which would prevent translation of this region and therefore HBeAg expression. Wild type sequences were also detected in this sample. In the other sample from a patient with overt chronic liver disease, a mutation of precore amino acid 28 changed a tryptophan residue to a stop codon which would also prevent HBeAg expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7991,0.003,3.0,"To investigate the range of pathology shown by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related lymphomas arising in an epidemiologically well-defined group of patients, all cases of lymphoma recognized in Danish human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals up to the end of 1988 were studied. Twenty-seven cases (26 high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL], 1 Hodgkin's disease) were found, to give a cumulative incidence rate of 8% among Danish AIDS patients. Morphologically most NHL patients were classified into two groups: 1) high-grade tumors with a predominant population of immunoblasts, either monomorphic or more often polymorphic with plasmacytic differentiation; 2) Burkitt-type. Of 26 NHLs, 22 had a B-cell paraffin-section immunophenotype and 4 were non-B, non-T. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was demonstrated in tumor cells of 12 of 24 cases (50%) using in situ nucleic acid hybridization with a 35S-labeled probe in paraffin sections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was found in 65% of group 1 and 20% of group 2 tumors. This study suggests the existence of two main groups of AIDS-related lymphoma with different pathogeneses. First there are immunoblast-rich lesions, which usually are associated with EBV and morphologically resemble lymphomas described in immunosuppressed organ-transplantation patients. Second there are Burkitt-type tumors in which EBV sequences are less common and that may be pathogenetically analogous to sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma."
3301,0.003,3.0,"Quantitative PCR assays used to monitor hepatitis B virus (HBV) load differ in their ability to detect different HBV variants. This study evaluated the performance of the Abbott RT PCR assay for quantitating DNA from different HBV genotypes and from HBV variants bearing HBsAg gene mutations. The study was performed on a randomly-selected sample with a viral load >6logIU/mL for each genotype and on 25 HBsAg variants. Each sample was assayed using the Abbott RT assay and with the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep-Cobas TaqMan as a reference method. All HBV genotypes were detected with the Abbott RT assay with an equivalent dynamic range (1-8logIU/mL). For each genotype, the data suggest that the assay was linear over the entire dilution range (r(2): 0.985-0.995). For the 25 HBsAg variants, viral titres determined with the two assays correlated well (r(2): 0.929). The mean difference between the two methods was -0.295 (95% CI: -0.520 to -0.071). The difference was lower than 1log unit in all but two cases. In conclusion, the Abbott RT assay can detect and quantify DNA from different HBV variants with equivalent performance and is thus suitable for routine monitoring of patients with chronic HBV infections."

8192,0.003,3.0,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."
2466,0.003,3.0,"Our work aimed to examine the potential influence of variants in interleukin/interleukin receptors genes on high-risk (HR-HPV) HPV clearance. Clearance of genital HR-HPV infection was evaluated for 134 HIV-1 seropositive African-American female adolescents from the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) cohort. Genotyping targeted 225 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the exons, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and 3' UTR sequences of 27 immune-related candidate genes encoding interleukin family of cytokines. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of type-specific HPV clearance adjusting for time-varying CD4+ T-cell count and low-risk (LR-HPV) HPV co-infections. HR-HPV clearance rates were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with five SNPs (rs228942, rs419598, rs315950, rs7737000, and rs9292618) mapped to coding and regulatory regions in three genes (IL2RB, IL1RN, and IL7R).

2732,0.003,3.0,"In order to assess the adequacy of learning about the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in vocational training for general practice, a postal questionnaire survey was carried out among trainers and their trainees in seven health regions of England and Scotland. A total of 616 trainers (62%) and 538 trainees (58%) responded to the questionnaire asking about their knowledge, skills and attitudes regarding HIV and AIDS. Trainees' principal difficulties with HIV and AIDS resembled those of general practitioners currently in practice. More than 60% of trainees lacked knowledge about HIV and AIDS in babies, 50% would not accept intravenous drug misusers onto their list, only 12% found it easy to discuss sex with homosexual male patients, and only 37% felt able to offer counselling about HIV and AIDS. Trainees who had had a tutorial on HIV and AIDS as part of vocational training were significantly more knowledgeable than the remainder (P less than 0.01). In addition, trainees who found workshops on HIV and AIDS useful were more willing than others to take on drug misusers (P less than 0.05) and more confident in their ability to counsel patients with HIV infection (P less than 0.01). No significant associations were found between the trainers' own knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding HIV and AIDS and those of their trainees. It is concluded that there is a need to improve teaching about HIV and AIDS in vocational training for general practice. All general practitioner trainees should receive a tutorial to update their knowledge about HIV and AIDS, and attend a suitable workshop to challenge unfavourable attitudes and improve confidence in counselling."

Thirty-five cases were women who accepted postpartum sterilization and twenty-two controls were women who refused this method. The acceptance of tubal occlusion was statistically more frequent in multiparous women, and in those with previous children infected with HIV. The antecedent of at least one previous pregnancy had an association with the acceptance of tubal occlusion with an OR of 11.2 (CI 95% 2.9 to 42.9); having at least one previous child HIV-infected had an OR of 4.6 (CI 95% 1.3 to 23.1).

These rates remained 17 times greater among AAPI children into the 1990s. Now, although almost 90% of AAPI children born after 1993 receive hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) in time to prevent HBV infection, many born before 1993 do not.

The strongest association was obtained for HCP5 rs2395029 (P=6.79x10(-10); odds ratio, 3.47) and was possibly linked to an effect of sex. Interestingly, this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was in high linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B, MICB, TNF, and several other HLA locus SNPs and haplotypes. A meta-analysis of our genomic data combined with data from the previously conducted Euro-CHAVI (Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology) GWAS confirmed the HCP5 signal (P=3.02x10(-19)) and identified several new associations, all of them involving HLA genes: MICB, TNF, RDBP, BAT1-5, PSORS1C1, and HLA-C. Finally, stratification by HCP5 rs2395029 genotypes emphasized an independent role for ZNRD1, also in the HLA locus, and this finding was confirmed by experimental data.

We aimed to assess resistance patterns and predict viral drug susceptibility among children with first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure in Uganda. A cross-sectional analysis of children switching ART regimens due to first-line failure was performed at three clinical sites in Uganda. HIV-RNA determination and genotypic resistance testing on all specimens with HIV-RNA >1,000 copies/ml were performed. Major drug resistance mutations were scored using the 2011 International Antiviral Society-USA list. The Stanford algorithm was used to predict drug susceptibility. At the time of switch, 44 genotypic resistance tests were available for 50 children. All children harbored virus with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-100%] and NRTI resistance was present in 98% (95% CI 88-100%). Forty-six percent (95% CI 30-61%) of children harbored ≥2 thymidine analog mutations. M184V was identified as the only NRTI mutation in 27% (95% CI 15-43%). HIV susceptibility to NRTIs, with the exception of tenofovir, was reduced in ≥60% of children. Ugandan children experiencing first-line ART failure in our study harbored high rates of dual-class and accumulated HIV drug resistance. Methods to prevent treatment failure, including adequate pediatric formulations and alternative second-line treatment options, are urgently needed."

5787,0.003,3.0,"HIV subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation following HAART treatment failure are limited. We studied patterns and accrual of drug resistance mutations in a Cambodian CRF01_AE-infected cohort continuing a virologically failing first-line, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor- (NNRTI-) based, HAART. Between 2005 and 2007, 837 adult HIV-infected patients had regular plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load measurements at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of Hope (SHCH), Cambodia. Drug resistance testing was performed in all patients with HIV-1 RNA >1000 copies/ml after at least 6 months of HAART. Seventy-one patients with a mean age of 34 years, of whom 68% were male, were retrospectively assessed at virological failure. The median duration of antiretroviral therapy was 12.3 (IQR 7.1-18.23) months, the median CD4 cell count was 173 (IQR 118-256) cells/mm(3), and the mean plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3.9 log (SD 0.72) at failure. NNRTI mutations, M184I/V mutation, thymidine analogue mutations, and K65R were observed in 78.9%, 69%, 20%, and 12.7% of patients, respectively. For 33 patients, genotypic testing was carried out on at least two occasions before the switch to second-line HAART after a median duration of 5.8 (IQR 4.3-6.1) months of virological failure: 54.5% of patients accumulated new mutations with a rate of 1.6 mutations per person-year. Accumulation was seen both for nucleoside and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and also in patients with low-level viremia. Subtype-specific data on mutation type, rate, and accumulation after HAART failure are urgently needed to optimize treatment strategies in resource-limited settings."
7938,0.003,3.0,"Recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and the important role that viral load plays in the initial selection of antiretroviral therapy significantly alters our management of this disease. Guidelines from the British HIV Association, International AIDS Society-USA, and United States Public Health Service panels regarding the selection of appropriate antiretroviral therapy, and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, have recently been published. Despite tremendous advances in treating the disease and its related complications, a comprehensive, long-term disease management plan that includes recognition of patient concerns about quality of life is lacking. New approaches to managing HIV disease must now include strategies that address patient concerns about fatigue, gastrointestinal distress, malnutrition, and weight loss. Patients must become more involved in decisions about selection of specific drugs and drug regimens and must be consulted about their expectations and needs. We have made significant strides in the treatment of HIV disease. We can readily reduce the viral burden to virtually undetectable levels, and we must continue to develop even more potent and tolerable treatment regimens. We can make patients live longer. Helping patients live better quality lives deserves further study."
7668,0.003,3.0,"Tuberculosis (TB) enhances human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) activity in patients with dual HIV-1/TB infection. Therapies that control augmentations of HIV-1 activity at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection may be useful in inhibition of viral expansion. Regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) analogues (AOP and NNY) are potent in inhibiting the entry of primary HIV-1 isolates into host mononuclear cells. These analogues were used to inhibit MTB-induced HIV-1 entry in blood monunuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with pulmonary TB, and pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) from patients with pleural TB. PBMC or PFMC were cultured with and without MTB in presence and absence of RANTES analogues. HIV-1 strong stop DNA was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a measure of infection. CCR5 mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and by immunostaining and FACS analysis. HIV-1 infection was induced by MTB in vitro in PBMC from the majority (14 of 20) of HIV-1/TB subjects, and new infection was inhibited by AOP- or NNY-RANTES. HIV-1 infection was also inhibited by these reagents in MTB-induced PFMC from three of three patients with pleural TB. Expression of CCR5 mRNA was significantly induced by MTB in PBMC from patients with pulmonary TB. Further, expression of CCR5 was higher in PFMC compared to PBMC from patients with pleural TB. Also, CCR5 was fourfold higher on CD14(+) pleural mononuclear cells than on CD4(+) lymphocytes. Blocking new HIV-1 infection of mononuclear cells may be useful in control of HIV-1 during dual HIV-1/TB infection."
8085,0.003,3.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) invades the central nervous system (CNS) during acute infection which can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in up to 50% of patients, even in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Within the CNS, productive HIV-1 infection occurs in the perivascular macrophages and microglia. Astrocytes also become infected, although their infection is restricted and does not give rise to new viral particles. The major barrier to the elimination of HIV-1 is the establishment of viral reservoirs in different anatomical sites throughout the body and viral persistence during long-term treatment with cART. While the predominant viral reservoir is believed to be resting CD4(+) T cells in the blood, other anatomical compartments including the CNS, gut-associated lymphoid tissue, bone marrow, and genital tract can also harbour persistently infected cellular reservoirs of HIV-1. Viral latency is predominantly responsible for HIV-1 persistence and is most likely governed at the transcriptional level. Current clinical trials are testing transcriptional activators, in the background of cART, in an attempt to purge these viral reservoirs and reverse viral latency. These strategies aim to activate viral transcription in cells constituting the viral reservoir, so they can be recognised and cleared by the immune system, while new rounds of infection are blocked by co-administration of cART. The CNS has several unique characteristics that may result in differences in viral transcription and in the way latency is established. These include CNS-specific cell types, different transcription factors, altered immune surveillance, and reduced antiretroviral drug bioavailability. A comprehensive understanding of viral transcription and latency in the CNS is required in order to determine treatment outcomes when using transcriptional activators within the CNS."

Community respiratory virus infections are increasingly recognized as a significant threat to these patients. This article reviews current information in the clinical field of community respiratory viruses, including several newly discovered respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses cause the most serious disease in immunocompromised hosts, but other respiratory viruses are becoming increasingly appreciated as a cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract disease. The clinical impact of these new viruses, including human metapneumovirus, non-SARS human coronaviruses, and human bocavirus, is not yet clear. Modern molecular technology has made the discovery of new viruses possible; the use of these new technologies in direct patient care is not yet standard but is becoming increasingly utilized.

In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the care of these patients has become increasingly complex as survival has improved. Patients infected with HIV who also have ESRD are at risk for critical interactions between medication regimens to treat both of these conditions. Within this population, hemo- and peritoneal dialysis as well as kidney transplantation are life sustaining but present a host of obstacles related to HIV monitoring and risk of transmission, access thrombosis, infection, and rejection. Knowledge of antiretroviral regimens, drug interactions, and HIV resistance as well as the management of ESRD in the presence of HIV infection will improve the care of these unique patients."
6869,0.003,3.0,"Human primary endothelial cell cultures, derived from umbilical vein (HUVEC), can be infected by different strains of HIV-1, but mature virus production remains undetectable both in supernatants and in cellular extracts. Yet viral DNA is transiently detectable during the first days of infection, but progressively declines during the subsequent days. This finding is characteristic of abortive infections. Co-culture of HUVEC carrying HIV DNA with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or with CD4-positive lymphoid cells elicited a massive cpe (syncytia formation and cell degeneration) in the latter cells, caused by the establishment of productive HIV-1 infection. HUVEC infected in the presence of AZT were significantly impaired in the ability to transmit the infection of CD4-positive cells, indicating that active DNA synthesis is required in HUVEC before rescue by CD4-positive cells. These results are of interest in view of the possibility that endothelial cells can play a role in the transmission of HIV-1 infection from infected pregnant women to the foetuses, and, more generally, suggest a potential role of endothelial cells as a transient reservoir of HIV-1."

9327,0.003,3.0,"The prognosis of HIV infection has been modified by antiretroviral therapy. However, the morbidity and the mortality of HCV co-infection increase and may be a major problem of health service. Up to now co-infected patients are excluded of transplantation due to complexity, the ethical aspects, the immunodeficiency and the co-infection. This study tries to estimate the feasibility in this population. Between December 1999 and March 2002, seven patients were transplanted. The average of CD4 was 332/ml; the viral load was <50 copies/ml. Before transplantation, no patient had experienced opportunist infection and all patients received antiretroviral therapy adapted to their history. The average follow-up is of 14 months: one patient died 3 months after transplantation, the other one presented a candida in oesophagus, the average of CD4 was 280/ml, and viral load was <50 copies/ml in five patients. A relapse of HVC was observed in all patients. Interferon/rivabirine therapy was proposed for four patients. Every patient received tacrolimus and corticoids. HAART were modified four times for toxicity and one time for virological failure. We observed two cases of transient renal insufficiency, two cases of diabetes, two cases of pancreatitis, and abnormalities of the respiratory mitochondrial chain in four patients. Finally, liver transplantation in HIV-HCV co-infected patients seems to be feasible when strict criteria of selection are taken into account. This still experimental strategy requires a multidisciplinary partnership."
3436,0.003,3.0,"The drug resistance profile of treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals living in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was studied. Samples taken from 94 drug-naive individuals with established HIV infection and 13 patients with primary HIV infection were assessed by nucleotide sequencing and LIPA. The prevalence of drug-associated primary mutations in individuals with established infection was very low. In the viral protease region, 1/86 (1.2%) individuals carried the D30N mutation, whereas 1/85 (1.2%) had the M41L mutation in the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. Secondary mutations in both the protease and RT regions were found in almost 90% of the individuals. In individuals with primary infection, primary mutations were detected in 2/13 (15.4%) patients, one of them carrying M461 mutation in the protease while the other patient had a mutation at codon 184 of the RT. In accordance with current drug resistance testing guidelines, the results of this study suggest that susceptibility tests need not be performed at this time prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected people in Argentina. However, the public health implications of this subject warrant follow-up studies that will examine a larger number of drug-naive patients, not only in Buenos Aires but also in other major Argentinian cities and in rural areas."

The 2.3 per cent positivity in the test group and the 8 per cent positivity in the control group did not suggest the involvement of hepatitis-B virus (HBV), as an influencing or associated agent. When 48 patients with glomerulonephropathies and 23 controls were screened for liver cell membrane (LMA) and renal cell membrane antibodies (RMA) by indirect immunofluorescent technique using isolated rat hepatocytes and renal cells, 79.2 per cent LMA positivity was seen in the HBsAg positive group and 41.7 per cent in the negative group and RMA positivity was 58 per cent in the positive group and 25 per cent in the negative group. Simultaneous positivity for both LMA and RMA was recorded in 50 per cent of the HBsAg positive patients and 15.7 per cent of the negative ones.

2607,0.003,3.0,"The study examined the relationship between coping and psychosocial variables (psychological stress symptoms, locus of control, emotional repression, and social support) among 108 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The authors administered several tests, including one that measures fighting spirit and degree of hopelessness, to assess each patient's individual coping style. The patients who were adjusting well to their HIV-positive status tended to have a higher level of fighting spirit and lower degree of hopelessness than those patients who were not adjusting well to their HIV-positive status. A coping style based on incapacity to face and confront HIV infection was associated with symptoms of psychological stress, repression of anger, external locus of control, and low social support in the latter group. These patients showed symptoms indicating maladjustment to HIV infection (43% of the sample) and differed from the ""noncases"" (the well-adjusted patients) in that the former group reported inadequate coping responses (lower fighting spirit and higher hopelessness, fatalistic attitude, and anxious preoccupation) and poorer social support, and had a greater tendency to repress anger and express sadness. The data support the hypothesis that coping with HIV infection is a complex phenomenon involving multiple and interacting variables. Interventions aimed at improving the coping style for many HIV patients are needed."
9745,0.003,3.0,"We conducted a survey of a random sample of California orthodontists and of general dentists to compare their infection control procedures. Questionnaires were returned by 124 orthodontists (56% response rate) and 126 general dentists (61% response rate). Eighteen questions were asked covering practice profile, perception of risk from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), exposure to blood, barrier protection used, and sterilization and disinfection procedures. Gloves always were worn by 80% of the orthodontists sampled, 63% always wore glasses, and 59% changed gloves between patients. Orthodontists sterilized their instruments 66% of the time and pliers 49% of the time. Compared with general dentists, orthodontists' perception of risk, use of barrier protection, and sterilization and disinfection procedures were lower in all areas. Our data suggest that poorer performance may be because orthodontists: (1) perceive their younger population of patients at less risk for HBV and HIV; (2) treat 2.5 times as many patients, which increases the costs of infection control; (3) do not use invasive procedures; and (4) perceive that glove use decreases dexterity. Orthodontists should follow the American Dental Association/Council on Dental Therapeutics infection control guidelines for universal precautions. To meet these guidelines, orthodontists still need improvement in all aspects of their infection control procedures."
348,0.003,3.0,"We describe the identification of the protozoan parasite Enterocytozoon bieneusi in the stool of a patient who was not infected with HIV but who presented with persistent diarrheal disease and severe abdominal complaints. The patient was not infected with HIV but had been noted to have a decreased CD4 cell count since at least 1992 and had had a prior episode of cryptococcal meningitis. The organisms were detected in stool smears with a modified trichrome stain and were identified to the species level by transmission electron microscopy of the stool. The patient responded readily and dramatically to treatment with albendazole, with resolution of symptoms and clearance of the organisms from the stool. Eight or possibly nine other cases of E. bieneusi infection associated with diarrheal disease in individuals who were not infected with HIV were identified in the English-language literature. In two individuals with intact immune function, symptoms were self-limited and diarrheal disease resolved within 2 weeks. The cases summarized herein suggest that E. bieneusi may be more commonly associated with sporadic diarrheal disease than was previously suspected and that the immune system may play a role in the control of this organism within the intestine."
6351,0.003,3.0,"The intersection and syndemic interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics have global prevalence with devastating morbidity and massive mortality. Using FDG-PET imaging it was shown that in HIV-infected individuals, involvement of the head and neck precedes that of the chest and of the abdomen. The sequence of lymph node involvement observed suggests the existence of a diffusible activation mediator that may be targeted via therapeutic intervention strategies. Furthermore, the degree of FDG uptake proved directly related to viral load and inversely related to CD4 cell count. Available data in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining cancers further suggest that FDG-PET/CT imaging may be useful for prognostication of cervical cancer and for identifying appropriate sites for biopsy, staging, and monitoring lymphoproliferative activity owing to HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma and multicentric Castleman disease. Inversely, in HIV-associated lymphoma, FDG uptake in HIV-involved lymphoid tissue was shown to reduce the specificity of FDG-PET imaging findings, the effect of which in clinical practice warrants further investigation. In the latter setting, knowledge of viremia appears to be essential for FDG-PET image interpretation. Early HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, formerly known as AIDS dementia complex, proved to be characterized by striatal hypermetabolism and progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder or AIDS dementia complex by a decrease in subcortical and cortical metabolism. In lipodystrophic HIV-infected individuals, lipodystrophy proved associated with increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue, likely resulting from the metabolic stress of adipose tissue in response to highly active antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, ongoing chronic low-grade infection in arteries of HIV-infected individuals could be depicted by FDG-PET/CT imaging. And there is promising data that FDG-PET/CT in HIV may serve as a new marker for the evaluation of thymic function in HIV-infected patients. In the setting of TB, FDG-PET has proven unable to differentiate malignancy from TB in patients presenting with solitary pulmonary nodules, including those suffering from HIV, and thus cannot be used as a tool to reduce futile biopsy or thoracotomy in these patients. In patients presenting with extrapulmonary TB, FDG-PET imaging was found to be significantly more efficient when compared with CT for the identification of more sites of involvement. Thus supporting that FDG-PET/CT can demonstrate lesion extent, serve as guide for biopsy with aspiration for culture, assist surgery planning and contribute to follow-up. Limited available data suggest that quantitative FDG-PET findings may allow for prediction or rapid assessment, at 4 months following treatment instigation, of response to antituberculostatics in TB-infected HIV patients. These results and more recent findings suggest a role for FDG-PET/CT imaging in the evaluation of therapeutic response in TB patients. "

Referral rate for HIV testing was 4.4% (30/684) in 2007, 15.4% (116/751) in 2008, and 30.1% (283/940) in 2009, with a significant upward trend over the period of time (P = .009). The main barriers perceived by health providers were poor knowledge about TB/HIV, lack of communication skills, absence of any target plan for TB patient referral for HIV testing, and fear associated with informing positive test results to the TB patients and the associated stigma. Strategies to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS/TB among TB patients and their providers may improve the current state of low referral and its barriers in Cambodia. "

However, 7 of 12 patients with seroconversion experienced relapse after cessation of therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that the duration of an undetectable HBV DNA load was the only independent predictive factor for nonrelapse (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.9). More-prolonged lamivudine therapy is required after seroconversion, and persistent duration of an HBV DNA level of <0.7 log IU/mL for >6 months can more accurately aid in the decision of when to stop lamivudine therapy."

Variables associated with initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) were analysed. Primary endpoint was time to failure after at least 6 months of ART and was defined as: VF, first of two consecutive virus loads (VL) >200 copies/mL; treatment discontinuation (TD) for any reason; and treatment failure as confirmed VL >200 copies/mL or TD. A Poisson multivariable analysis was performed to control for confounders. Migrants presented significantly lower CD4 counts and more frequent AIDS events at baseline. When adjusting for baseline confounders, migrants presented a lower likelihood to begin ART (odds ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.95, p 0.012). After initiating ART, the incidence VF rate was 6.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI 4.8-8.5) in migrants and 2.7 in natives (95% CI 2.2-3.3). Multivariable analysis confirmed that migrants had a higher risk of VF (incidence rate ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-2.91, p 0.003) and treatment failure (incidence rate ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p 0.031), with no differences for TD. Among migrants, variables associated with VF were age, unemployment and use of a boosted protease inhibitor-based regimen versus nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

3465,0.003,3.0,"Certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles are associated with improved clinical outcomes for individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms for their effects remain undefined. An early CD8(+) T-cell escape mutation in the dominant HLA-B57-restricted Gag epitope TW10 (TSTLQEQIGW) has been shown to impair HIV-1 replication capacity in vitro. We demonstrate here that this T(242)N substitution in the capsid protein is associated with upstream mutations at residues H(219), I(223), and M(228) in the cyclophilin A (CypA)-binding loop in B57(+) individuals with progressive disease. In an independent cohort of epidemiologically linked transmission pairs, the presence of these substitutions in viruses encoding T(242)N was associated with significantly higher plasma viremia in donors, further suggesting that these secondary mutations compensated for the replication defect of T(242)N. Using NL4-3 constructs, we illustrate the ability of these CypA loop changes to partially restore replication of the T(242)N variant in vitro. Notably, these mutations also enhanced viral resistance to the drug cyclosporine A, indicating a reduced dependence of the compensated virus on CypA that is normally essential for optimal infectivity. Therefore, mutations in TW10 allow HIV-1 to evade a dominant early CD8(+) T-cell response, but the benefits of escape are offset by a defect in capsid function. These data suggest that TW10 escape variants undergo a postentry block that is partially overcome by changes in the CypA-binding loop and identify a mechanism for an HIV-1 fitness defect that may contribute to the slower disease progression associated with HLA-B57."
2113,0.003,3.0,"HIV-1 sequences from perinatally infected children were analyzed in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region and nef in order to investigate associations of viral variation and disease progression. Four long-term survivors who reached 10 years of age or older, and four rapid progressors who survived less than 2 years, participated in this study. LTR sequences of multiple independent viral variants from each individual were compared. No sequence pattern within the LTR consistently distinguished long-term survivors from rapid progressors or vice versa. Deletions and insertions within transcription factor binding sites of the LTR and nef ranging from 8 to 341 bp were found in viral variants from the eldest long-term survivor (LTS047). These deletions and duplications may be associated with the survival of LTS047 via an unknown mechanism. Among all children in this study, the sites in the untranslated region (NF-kappaB, SP1, and TATA box) were more conserved than the sites in the nef/LTR overlap region (NFAT, purine-rich region, USF, TCF1alpha), reflecting the importance of the sites in the untranslated region for viral replication. A mutation in the E box motif within the USF site among the sequences from a long-term survivor (LTS113) is predicted to disrupt protein binding and may be associated with slow disease progression. Mutations of the SP1-III site in a rapid progressor (RP056) indicate that this site is not necessary for rapid disease progression."

Two hundred and thirty-four patients were intravenous drug users (IVDU), 99 had homosexual and 142 heterosexual preference, seven had received blood transfusions and two had no risk factors. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb) and to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) were investigated in all patients; antibodies to HBsAg (HBsAb) and IgG antibodies to hepatitis D virus (anti-HDV) in all HBcAb-positive patients; hepatitis B e antigen and antibodies to HBeAg (HBeAg) in all HBsAg-positive patients; IgG antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in the first 307 patients; and IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) in the first 91 patients. As control groups, contemporary voluntary blood donors were studied for prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV and HEV. The percentages of HBcAb, HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HEV (58.5, 14.5, 58.5 and 6.6%, respectively) were significantly higher in anti-HIV-positive patients than in control groups (3.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.8%, respectively) (P = 0.000). The prevalence of HBcAb was significantly higher in IVDU (72.6%) than in heterosexuals (33.8%) (P = 0.0001) and in homosexuals (59.6%) (P = 0.0189). The percentage of HBsAg was significantly higher in IVDU (19.2%) than in heterosexuals (6.3%) (P = 0.0004). Anti-HCV was significantly higher in IVDU (92.3%) than in homosexuals (14.1%) and in heterosexuals (33.1%) (P = 0.000 in both cases). The prevalence of anti-HDV was relatively low (1.9%). There was no difference in the percentage of anti-HAV between HIV-positive and negative subjects. In conclusion, there is a high prevalence of HBV and HCV infections in HIV-positive patients from our area. Drug use is the main route of transmission, but prevalence of HCV in patients with, probably, sexually acquired HIV infection is also higher than in the control group. The increased prevalence of HEV infection in HIV-positive individuals is another provocative finding that warrants further study."
9474,0.002,2.0,"Evidence for efficacy of established treatment guidelines for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease is based on multinational randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Strategies for managing HCV, however, require an assessment of the effectiveness of intervention in routine clinical practice. We report the outcomes of combination therapy in a large cohort of HCV-infected individuals in the UK. A total of 347 (113 genotype 1, 234 genotype non-1) patients were treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin according to current guidelines. Forty-two (37.2%) of those with genotype 1 infection and 164 (70.1%) with genotype non-1 infection achieved sustained viral response (SVR). Thirty-nine (11%) patients withdrew from treatment. In addition to viral genotype, factors predictive of a response to therapy were age at start of treatment and disease stage on pretreatment liver biopsy. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age [odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval (0.31-0.82) per 10-year increment (P = 0.006)] were confined to genotype 1 disease. In order to further inform the management of the individual patient, a multivariate logistic model was used to predict the probability of SVR for subgroups defined by disease stage, genotype and age at commencement of therapy. This model revealed striking differences in predicted response rates between subgroups and provided a strong rationale for early treatment, particularly for those with genotype 1 disease. Our study demonstrates that results comparable with those of RCTs can be achieved in clinical practice, and suggests that prediction of response rates based on probability modelling will provide a valuable adjunct to individual patient management."
8173,0.002,2.0,"Penicillium marneffei (P. marneffei) is considered an indicator pathogen of AIDS, and the endemicity and clinical features of P. marneffei have been described. While, how the co-infection of P. marneffei exacerbate deterioration of the immune response remains poorly understood. Here we isolated P. marneffei from the cutaneous lesions of AIDS patients and analyzed its effects on HIV-1-dendritic cells (DCs) interaction. We demonstrated that the monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) could be activated by both thermally dimorphic forms of P. marneffei for significantly promoting HIV-1 trans-infection of CD4(+) T cells, while these activated MDDCs were refractory to HIV-1 infection. Mechanistically, P. marneffei-activated MDDCs endocytosed large amounts of HIV-1 and sequestrated the internalized viruses into tetrapasnin CD81(+) compartments potentially for proteolysis escaping. The activated MDDCs increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and facilitated the formation of DC-T-cell conjunctions, where much more viruses were recruited. Moreover, we found that P. marneffei-stimulated MDDCs efficiently activated resting CD4(+) T cells and induced more susceptible targets for viral infection. Our findings demonstrate that DC function and its interaction with HIV-1 have been modulated by opportunistic pathogens such as P. marneffei for viral dissemination and infection amplification, highlighting the importance of understanding DC-HIV-1 interaction for viral immunopathogenesis elucidation."

3735,0.002,2.0,"The age-specific prevalence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and its antibody (anti-HBe) were studied by radioimmunoassay, and compared in a large series of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including 268 asymptomatic carriers, 389 chronic hepatitis, 114 liver cirrhosis, and 278 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of HBeAg/anti-HBe in asymptomatic carriers and patients with chronic hepatitis correlated closely with age as HBeAg prevalence decreased and anti-HBe prevalence increased with increasing age (P less than 0.0005), and is probably due to high infection rate at young age in Taiwan. The prevalence of HBeAg in patients with both cirrhosis and HCC are much significantly lower and had no correlation with age. Two peaks of age-specific prevalence of HBeAg and anti-HBe were observed in patients with HCC, implicating two patterns of HBV infection in these patients. The difference in the prevalence of HBeAg and anti-HBe might indicate that asymptomatic carriers, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and HCC are sequential sequelae of HBV infection."

4455,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this study was to describe the epidemic of clinically apparent human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) infection in Nicaragua and to discuss the reasons why the number of HIV patients presenting to the public health care system is increasing compared with other Central American countries. From 1987 to 2004, 1,614 HIV-positive patients were officially reported to the Nicaraguan STI/HIV/AIDS national program. Urban areas along the west-central and eastern part of Nicaragua showed the highest prevalence of AIDS, with a maximum of 54.2/year per 100,000 inhabitants. Most of the infections (91%) were acquired sexually: 65% by heterosexual contacts and 26% by homosexual contacts. The highest rate of infection was found in men aged between 20 to 39 years, with a peak around 35 to 39 years (annual incidence of 125.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants), and in women aged 20 to 34 years old, with a peak around 20 to 24 years (annual incidence 46.6 per 100,000 inhabitants). The male to female ratio of infection was 3:1. The death rate was stable until the beginning of 1999, but increased sharply thereafter up to 2004, the year that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced in Nicaragua. In 2005, we observed a further increase in the mortality. However, our data do not represent the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a whole, due to a lack of systemic surveillance. HIV/AIDS in Nicaragua is in a nascent stage and is concentrated in high-risk populations, such as utility workers, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men, prisoners, street children, housewives and police and military forces. Education of the population is an urgent need to increase HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, change attitudes, and increase safer sex practice in the community."
1145,0.002,2.0,"Long-term medication regimen adherence is challenging in all populations, but in the HIV-infected adolescent population the frequency of poverty, homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness make highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence even more challenging. In 2003, we developed a pilot program for HIV-infected adolescents and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24 who were either going to begin a HAART regimen for the first time or begin a new HAART regimen. Participants received a free cell phone with a local service plan for approximately 6 months. Participants received phone call reminders for 12 weeks. Call frequency was tapered at 4-week intervals. Patients were assessed at 4-week intervals to determine the perceived intrusiveness or helpfulness of receiving calls, and missed medication doses. Eight consecutive patients were recruited for the study, and five were able to complete it through the 24 weeks. Most participants found the calls to be helpful and the level of intrusion into their daily lives acceptable. Using cell phone reminders to assist patients does not require an extensive amount of daily staff time. Tapering calls rapidly over 3 months, followed by discontinuation of calls provided inadequate support for subjects, especially those with significant psychosocial issues such as substance abuse. Use of cell phone reminders to assist adolescents adhere with HIV medications was practical and acceptable to pilot study participants. Viral suppression waned for all but two patients after termination of cell phone reminders and suggests that a 12-week intervention was not adequate for most subjects. Larger prospective studies of cell phone observation of therapy will be needed to determine if this intervention can improve long-term adherence and health outcomes."
1246,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection rate was examined in a selected cohort of healthy clients of an inner-city alcohol treatment center from 1990 through 1993. These subjects were also participating in a research protocol (n = 258) designed to assess immunity and HIV risk behaviors in inner city alcohol-dependent persons. Healthy alcohol-abusing heterosexual clients (165) had HIV testing conducted in an inner-city ambulatory alcohol treatment center between September 1990 and December 1993. Respondents were 93.9% African-American and 3.6% Hispanic; 72.1% were male. Anonymous HIV-1 antibody testing was conducted retrospectively for an additional 80 subjects who participated in the research protocol during the same interval, but for whom HIV-1 antibody testing was not conducted clinically at the time. HIV infection rate among the clinic-tested subjects (n = 165) was 4.4% for individuals who were exclusively alcohol-dependent, 1.4% for non-injecting drug use (IDU) mixed substance abusers, and 46.8% for clients with a history of IDU. Rates did not differ among cohorts tested in different years. Among non-injecting drug users tested in the clinic, all infected respondents (n = 3) were women (p = 0.03). Among those tested anonymously (n = 80), however, infection rate for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons was 16.7%, non-IDU mixed abusers 11.1%, and injecting drug users 48.3%, with seropositive males as well as females in each group. HIV infection rates for the pooled samples (n = 245) were 8.7% for exclusively alcohol-dependent persons, 5.1% for mixed abusers, and 54.5% for injecting drug users. Among non-injecting drug users, exclusively alcohol-dependent women had a significantly higher (p < 0.01) infection rate (20.0%) than the remaining females and males. Infection rates among exclusively alcohol-dependent males, male and female polysubstance non-IDU abusers, and injecting drug users were comparable with that seen in an earlier screening in the same clinic in 1989, with apparently little diffusion of infection from the IDU population to other substance abusers. An exception seemed to be exclusively alcohol-dependent females, who show substantially elevated rates. Age, housing, and other social differences may help segregated substance-abusing populations in the relatively small Newark metropolitan area, although not protecting exclusively alcohol-dependent females."
9677,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to determine which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes were circulating in Australia and to correlate the subtypes with risk factors associated with the acquisition of HIV-1 infection. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and HIV-1 env genes were amplified and subtyped using heteroduplex mobility analysis, with selected samples sequenced and phylogenetic analysis performed. The HIV-1 env subtypes were determined for 141 samples, of which 40 were from female patients and 101 were from male patients; 13 samples were from children. Forty-seven patients were infected by homosexual or bisexual contact, 46 were infected through heterosexual contact, 21 were infected from injecting drug use (IDU), 13 were infected by vertical transmission, 8 were infected from nosocomial exposure, and 6 were infected by other modes of transmission, including exposure to blood products, ritualistic practices, and two cases of intrafamilial transmission. Five subtypes were detected; B (n = 104), A (n = 5), C (n = 17), E (CRF01_AE; n = 13), and G (n = 2). Subtype B predominated in HIV-1 acquired homosexually (94% of cases) and by IDU (100%), whereas non-subtype B infections were mostly seen in heterosexually (57%) or vertically (22%) acquired HIV-1 infections and were usually imported from Africa and Asia. Subtype B strains of group M viruses predominate in Australia in HIV-1 transmitted by homosexual or bisexual contact and IDU. However, non-B subtypes have been introduced, mostly acquired via heterosexual contact."

7985,0.002,2.0,"The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from various types of homosexual contact, including oral sex, is of biologic, epidemiologic, and public health importance. The per-contact risk of acquiring HIV infection from specific acts was estimated in a prospective cohort study of 2,189 high-risk homosexual and bisexual men, conducted in San Francisco, California; Denver, Colorado; and Chicago, Illinois, in 1992-1994. During 2,633 person-years of follow-up, 60 seroconversions were observed. The estimated per-contact risk of acquiring HIV from unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URA) was 0.82 percent (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 2.76 percent) when the partner was known to be HIV+ and 0.27 percent (95% confidence interval: 0.06, 0.49 percent) when partners of unknown serostatus were included. There was heterogeneity in per-contact risk, with nine seroconversions occurring after only one or two episodes of URA. The per-contact risk associated with unprotected insertive anal and receptive oral sex with HIV-positive or unknown serostatus partners was 0.06 and 0.04 percent, respectively. URA accounted for only 15 percent of all reported sexual activity by seroconverters. As lower-risk practices become more common, they may play a larger role in propagating the epidemic and should also be addressed by interventions targeting high-risk homosexual and bisexual men."
6358,0.002,2.0,"Contact tracing--or partner notification--is a generally accepted method for the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but its use as an epidemiological tool against the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been questioned. The authors find contact tracing for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) quite feasible; it makes it possible for health care providers to reach people at high risk for infection in order to offer them counseling and testing. Contact tracing must be performed by someone directly engaged in caring for the HIV infected patient, as well as in giving support and aiding the patient through possible crisis reactions. Through this approach the authors were able to identify 188 contacts to 91 index patients. Thirty-eight of the contacts were seropositive for HIV infection, and 21 of these were previously unaware of their infection."
9797,0.002,2.0,"Understanding the mechanisms underlying potential altered susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in highly exposed seronegative (ES) individuals and the later clinical consequences of breakthrough infection can provide insight into strategies to control HIV-1 with an effective vaccine. From our Seattle ES cohort, we identified one individual (LSC63) who seroconverted after over 2 years of repeated unprotected sexual contact with his HIV-1-infected partner (P63) and other sexual partners of unknown HIV-1 serostatus. The HIV-1 variants infecting LSC63 were genetically unrelated to those sequenced from P63. This may not be surprising, since viral load measurements in P63 were repeatedly below 50 copies/ml, making him an unlikely transmitter. However, broad HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were detected in LSC63 before seroconversion. Compared to those detected after seroconversion, these responses were of lower magnitude and half of them targeted different regions of the viral proteome. Strong HLA-B27-restricted CTLs, which have been associated with disease control, were detected in LSC63 after but not before seroconversion. Furthermore, for the majority of the protein-coding regions of the HIV-1 variants in LSC63 (except gp41, nef, and the 3' half of pol), the genetic distances between the infecting viruses and the viruses to which he was exposed through P63 (termed the exposed virus) were comparable to the distances between random subtype B HIV-1 sequences and the exposed viruses. These results suggest that broad preinfection immune responses were not able to prevent the acquisition of HIV-1 infection in LSC63, even though the infecting viruses were not particularly distant from the viruses that may have elicited these responses."
8828,0.002,2.0,"We describe four patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had development of meningiomas. In contrast to those in the general population who have meningiomas, all our patients were young men; the mean age was 40 years (range, 32 to 50). Their risk behavior for HIV was homosexuality (three patients) and intravenous drug use (one patient). The CD4+ cell count in each of the three homosexual men was less than 50/microL and was 280/microL in the drug user. Imaging studies showed enhancing lesions in three of the patients. Although each of these meningiomas could have occurred in otherwise normal young to middle-aged men, we speculate that the meningiomas may have grown in these HIV-infected hosts because of either loss of immune function or dysregulation of cytokines."
3798,0.002,2.0,"The objective of this study was to examine the level of antiretroviral use and characterize individuals accessing antiretroviral therapy in British Columbia. The study was conducted by the British Columbia Persons with AIDS Society and the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed out to HIV-positive members from May to September of 2002. Comparisons of sociodemographic characteristics and disease status were made using Pearson's Chi2 and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. A total of 764 (51%) HIV-positive participants returned the questionnaire. Of these, 80% reported ever using antiretroviral therapy and 64.5% indicated current use. Reasons for never taking antiretroviral therapy were high CD4 or doctor's advice (74/126; 59%), feeling healthy (50/126; 40%) and being afraid of side-effects (35/126; 28%). Those reporting current antiretroviral use were more likely to be older (p<0.001), white (p=0.01), male (p<0.001), gay or bisexual (p<0.001), graduated from high school (p=0.001), non-injecting drug user (IDU) (p<0.001) and earning a household income greater than CAN$10,000/year (p=0.003). IDU status and length of time since diagnosis remained significantly associated with antiretroviral use in multivariate models. The differences in current antiretroviral use by sociodemographic characteristics such as IDU suggest that the need remains to target marginalized populations in order to maximize the health benefits from antiretroviral therapy."
4171,0.002,2.0,"Bilateral lower motor neuron type facial palsy is an unusual neurological disorder. There are few reports that associate it with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on initial presentation. A 51-year-old married woman, who was previously healthy and had no risk of HIV infection, presented solely with bilateral simultaneous facial palsy. A positive HIV serology test was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Following a short course of oral prednisolone, the patient recovered completely from facial palsy in three months, even though an antiretroviral treatment was suspended. Exclusion of HIV infection in patients with bilateral facial palsy is essential for early diagnosis and management of HIV. "
7299,0.002,2.0,"Progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome is a recently recognized variant of necrotizing herpetic retinopathy, developing in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or other conditions causing immune compromise. We report a case in which the diagnosis of retinal necrosis syndrome was made before the diagnosis of AIDS was confirmed. A 41-year-old man presented with a 1-month history of blurred vision in his left eye. Ophthalmologic examination revealed extensive retinal necrosis with total retinal detachment in his left eye and multifocal deep retinal lesions scattered in the posterior fundus as well as in the peripheral retina in his right eye. The serologic test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was positive. Despite intravenous acyclovir treatment for 1 week, the lesions in the right eye showed rapid progression. High doses of intravitreal ganciclovir were then given in addition to intravenous acyclovir. After combined treatment for 1 month, the lesions became quiescent and the visual acuity improved to 20/30. Although the patient soon developed full-blown AIDS, the vision in his right eye remained undisturbed. Physicians should suspect progressive outer retinal necrosis syndrome in any patient with rapidly progressive necrotizing retinopathy and test the patient for HIV infection. Aggressive combined antiviral agent therapy should be considered to save vision."

1870,0.002,2.0,"In order to understand the significance of presence of HIV-1 in saliva, we searched for by PCR HIV-1 proviral sequences in the saliva cells of 49 HIV-1 infected patients. Seven out 49 specimens resulted positive, 4 of which were from patients with PGL, 1 with ARC and 2 with AIDS. Four patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte counts < 200/cmm and in 3 patients the CD4+ lymphocyte count ranged from 200 to 400/cmm. Two patients were treated with AZT, 1 with DDI and 4 had no antiretroviral treatment. In conclusion, although HIV-1 proviral sequences have been found in saliva of HIV-1 infected patients, a larger group of patients should be investigated to define more precisely the role of HIV-1 in saliva."
689,0.002,2.0,"Peripheral nerve disorders are among the most common neurological complications of HIV disease. Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common form of neuropathy in patients with AIDS and can be caused by diverse mechanisms, including infectious, metabolic, inflammatory, nutritional, and toxic factors. Antiretroviral agents may cause or contribute to HIV-related DSP. Recognition of peripheral neuropathy has become increasingly important as more patients receive nucleoside analogue agents for the treatment of HIV disease. It is crucial to correctly distinguish between the neuropathies caused by toxic effects of nucleoside analogues and those that are primarily related to underlying HIV disease, because timely diagnosis and proper treatment of peripheral neuropathies may allow the continuation of antiretroviral therapy as well as improve the quality of life. The identification and treatment of peripheral neuropathies associated with use of the nucleoside drugs zalcitabine (ddC), didanosine (ddI), and stavudine (d4T) are reviewed."
9732,0.002,2.0,"A decade has passed since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as standard of care for HIV/AIDS patients. The success of HAART is largely dependent on almost 100% adherence to it. In this study our primary aim was to understand from patients' own perspectives and experiences what resulted in them having 100% adherence to HAART. Thus, we purposefully recruited for in-depth interviews 10 participants (7 men and 3 women) with 100% adherence to HAART (>/=6 months previous to the interviews). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by using Giorgi's phenomenological analysis approach. The following issues emerged from the analysis: readiness to go on HAART; HAART viewed as a life-line; maintenance of 100% adherence related with willingness to live longer and healthier; optimal ongoing patient-physician relationship, better coping and/or lack of perceived side effects; and improvements in clinical condition as well as in CD4 T-cells count and viral load reinforced the motivation to continue 100% adherence. The study findings should be helpful for health professionals caring for HIV-infected individuals on HAART."

34,0.002,2.0,"This article critically discusses the nursing care and management of a person living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as a long-term condition, requiring highly complex HIV care. Complex HIV care is managed in the secondary care setting. However, recent legislation has motivated shifts in HIV care to the community care setting. This article aims to enhance health professionals' understanding in order to equip practice and district nurses to deliver HIV care provision. Antiretroviral adherence is a prerequisite for disease survival as well as an essential component of complete HIV self-care management. It is therefore imperative that nurses tailor adherence strategies according to each patient's requirements. Case management strategies such as the use of cognitive behavioural therapy to alleviate depressive symptoms will be considered. Furthermore, the use of motivational interviewing for antiretroviral adherence is highlighted as a potential intervention to help patients overcome the physical, psychological and physiological challenges of living with HIV-associated comorbidities. The delivery of integrated HIV care is pivotal for the management of the person living with HIV, as is the facilitation of a self-caring behaviour. "
2514,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have highlighted disparities in care and outcomes in HIV-positive prisoners compared to HIV-positive individuals in the population. We audited clinical outcomes of HIV-positive prisoners accessing care in 2011. Public Health England were notified of 161 prisoners with HIV in the time period studied. Audit proformas were sent to clinics reporting prisoners to the genitourinary medicine clinic activity dataset in 2011. Thirty-two clinics responded. Data for 151 HIV-positive prisoners were reported by 12 clinics, with the other clinics not reporting any prisoners. Outcomes were compared to a previous audit, British HIV Association (BHIVA) and the National AIDS Trust guidelines. Initial CD4 counts were available for 101 patients, of which 42/101 had CD4 <350 cells/mm(3). At reception, viral load data were available for 95 patients, of which 74 were on antiretroviral therapy. Of these, 50/74 (68%) had VL <40 copies/ml. Fifty-one per cent of those on highly active antiretroviral therapy were seen in a specialist clinic less than four weeks after reception. Urgency of referral to a specialist HIV clinic was not related to CD4 or viral load. Twenty-two per cent had hepatitis C co-infection. Clinical outcomes have improved since the last audit but further opportunities exist to optimise care in prisons. "
8126,0.002,2.0,"Circulating complete and defective hepatitis B virus forms, as represented by full, DNA polymerase-positive and empty, DNA polymerase-negative Dane particles, respectively, were investigated in sera from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and related to the presence of e antigen and antibody and to the histological findings on liver biopsy. Complete hepatitis B virus particles were detected in the serum of all patients postive for e antigen, their percentage ranging from 15 to 61% of the total Dane particle population. Although most of these cases had chronic persistent or chronic active hepatitis, complete viral particles were also found in serum of 3 healthy carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen who had e antigen. These results indicate that e antigen is a marker of active virus replication and support its association with infectivity. It is also associated with liver damage because production of complete virus is a feature of chronic hepatitis. In the presence of anti-e, detection of Dane particles in serum appeared to be related to the histological findings. Most of the healthy carriers had no Dane particles in serum, whereas 80% of the cases with chronic liver disease had circulating Dane particles. However, in contrast to the cases with e antigen, 98 to 100% of Dane particles in these cases appeared to be defective in nucleic acid material on electron microscopy after positive staining. All of the patients with chronic active hepatitis in this group had progressed to cirrhosis and it is possible that production of complete virus particles is reduced in the later stages of the illness."
9481,0.002,2.0,"We examined the association of primary or nonprimary sexual partner relationship status on sexual risk behaviors, including condom use, among Latina women who are at self-disclosed increased heterosexual risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Data were collected via structured interviews of 187 Puerto Rican women, aged 18-35, who attended a health clinic in the Bronx, New York. Approximately 13% of participants reported sexual activities with both primary and nonprimary sexual partners during the 6 months prior to the interview. Primary or nonprimary sexual partner status was associated with significant differences in frequency of condom use during anal sex and oral-penile sex, with more frequent condom use reported during these sexual activities with nonprimary sexual partners. Thus, potential contextual differences associated with primary or nonprimary relationship status may represent important factors to consider when designing interventions to facilitate HIV-protective behaviors among populations of urban women identified at increased heterosexual risk for HIV infection."

HIV seroprevalence in STD clinics ranged from 0 to 38.5% (median, 2.3%), with the highest rates found in the Mid-Atlantic states, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The highest median rates were found in men who have sex with men (36.1%) and heterosexual intravenous (IV) drug users (4.1%). For heterosexual persons who do not report IV drug use, median rates were highest in the 35- to 39-year-old age group for men (6.4%) and the 30- to 34-year-old age group for women (0.9%). Among persons who do not report risk behaviors for HIV infection, men had substantially higher median rates of HIV infection than women (P less than 0.001, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test), and rates were positively correlated with HIV infection rates in IV drug users in the same clinic (Pearson correlation coefficient [r] = 0.8; P less than 0.001). Among heterosexual STD clinic patients who do not report IV drug use, the median HIV infection rate for blacks (1.8%) was at least 2 times higher than the median infection rates for hispanics (0.9%) and whites (0.7%). The results of this study show that HIV infection in STD clinic patients varies by geographic area, sex, race and ethnic group, and risk behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
9091,0.002,2.0,"Research in the past two decades has generated unequivocal evidence that host genetic variations substantially account for the heterogeneous outcomes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. In particular, genes encoding human leukocyte antigens (HLA) have various alleles, haplotypes, or specific motifs that can dictate the set-point (a relatively steady state) of plasma viral load (VL), although rapid viral evolution driven by innate and acquired immune responses can obscure the long-term relationships between HLA genotypes and HIV-1-related outcomes. In our analyses of VL data from 521 recent HIV-1 seroconverters enrolled from eastern and southern Africa, HLA-A*03:01 was strongly and persistently associated with low VL in women (frequency = 11.3 %, P < 0.0001) but not in men (frequency = 7.7 %, P = 0.66). This novel sex by HLA interaction (P = 0.003, q = 0.090) did not extend to other frequent HLA class I alleles (n = 34), although HLA-C*18:01 also showed a weak association with low VL in women only (frequency = 9.3 %, P = 0.042, q > 0.50). In a reduced multivariable model, age, sex, geography (clinical sites), previously identified HLA factors (HLA-B*18, B*45, B*53, and B*57), and the interaction term for female sex and HLA-A*03:01 collectively explained 17.0 % of the overall variance in geometric mean VL over a 3-year follow-up period (P < 0.0001). Multiple sensitivity analyses of longitudinal and cross-sectional VL data yielded consistent results. These findings can serve as a proof of principle that the gap of ""missing heritability"" in quantitative genetics can be partially bridged by a systematic evaluation of sex-specific associations."
2381,0.002,2.0,"We retrospectively investigated the clinical and histopathologic features of hospitalized patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus who had symptomatic lactic acidosis syndrome at a university teaching hospital during 1995-2000. Twelve patients were identified, 11 during 1998-2000; of these, 5 died with rapid progression to otherwise unexplained multiple-organ failure. All had extensive prior exposure to nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). At presentation, the most commonly identified NRTI component of antiretroviral regimens was stavudine plus didanosine. Eleven patients presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and/or emesis. Eight patients had prior acute weight loss (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-5.3 kg). Median venous plasma lactate levels were > or =2-fold greater than the upper limit of normal (2.1 mmol/L). Serum transaminase levels were near normal limits at presentation. Histopathologic studies confirmed hepatic macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis in 6 patients. Concurrent chemical pancreatitis was identified in 6 patients. The increasing number of cases identified during the study period suggests that physicians better recognize symptomatic lactic acidosis and/or that cumulative NRTI exposure may increase the risk for this syndrome."
8316,0.002,2.0,"In contrast to HIV-infected humans, naturally SIV-infected sooty mangabeys (SMs) very rarely progress to AIDS. Although the mechanisms underlying this disease resistance are unknown, a consistent feature of natural SIV infection is the absence of the generalized immune activation associated with HIV infection. To define the correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs, we conducted a cross-sectional immunological study of 110 naturally SIV-infected SMs. The nonpathogenic nature of the infection was confirmed by an average CD4(+) T cell count of 1,076 +/- 589/mm(3) despite chronic infection with a highly replicating virus. No correlation was found between CD4(+) T cell counts and either age (used as a surrogate marker for length of infection) or viremia. The strongest correlates of preserved CD4(+) T cell counts were a low percentage of circulating effector T cells (CD28(-)CD95(+) and/or IL-7R/CD127(-)) and a high percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that the level of immune activation is a key determinant of CD4(+) T cell counts in SIV-infected SMs. Interestingly, we identified 14 animals with CD4(+) T cell counts of <500/mm(3), of which two show severe and persistent CD4(+) T cell depletion (<50/mm(3)). Thus, significant CD4(+) T cell depletion does occasionally follow SIV infection of SMs even in the context of generally low levels of immune activation, lending support to the hypothesis of multifactorial control of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis in this model of infection. The absence of AIDS in these ""CD4(low)"" naturally SIV-infected SMs defines a protective role of the reduced immune activation even in the context of a significant CD4(+) T cell depletion."
5740,0.002,2.0,"The atherogenic effects of some highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens, especially those including protease inhibitors (PI), may synergistically promote the acceleration of cardiovascular disease and increase the risk of death from cardiovascular events even in young HIV-infected people. Along with the endothelial dysfunction associated with visceral fat accumulation and related metabolic alterations of HIV-lipodystrophy syndrome (eg, insulin resistance), vascular injury has been associated with HIV-1 infection itself, with an autoimmune reaction to viral infection (vasculitis) and with a direct action of drugs included in HAART regimens. Clinical studies suggest that HIV-infected patients under PI-including HAART and with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors, should be considered at risk for developing coronary artery disease, and that this risk increases with the time of exposure to HAART. A careful cardiovascular screening and monitoring of HIV-infected patients receiving HAART is needed according to the most recent clinical guidelines."
1489,0.002,2.0,"The detection of infectious immune complexes in plasma after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may be useful as a surrogate marker of progression of disease and may help in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitates of plasma were tested for the presence of HIV p24 antigen and infectious virus. Results were compared with data from cell and plasma cultures, plasma p24 antigen, CD4 cell counts, and stage of disease. PEG precipitation increased the detection rate of the p24 antigen assay from 38.3% to 58.7%. There was a significant correlation between precipitable p24 antigen and plasma viremia, changes in CD4 cell counts, and progression of disease. The sensitivity of the PEG-precipitable p24 antigen assay versus traditional p24 antigen testing was 59.0% and the specificity 91.7%. The assay was reproducible and may be a useful determinant of viral load, clinical progression, and antiretroviral efficacy."
5038,0.002,2.0,"It is well accepted that adaptive immunity plays a key role in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In contrast, the contribution of innate immunity has only received attention in recent years. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) sense pathogen-associated molecule patterns and activate antiviral mechanisms, including intracellular antiviral pathways and the production of antiviral effector interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Experimental results from in vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that TLRs mediate the activation of cellular signaling pathways and the production of antiviral cytokines, resulting in a suppression of HBV replication. However, HBV infection is associated with downregulation of TLR expression on host cells and blockade of the activation of downstream signaling pathways. In primary HBV infection, TLRs may slow down HBV infection, but contribute only indirectly to viral clearance. Importantly, TLRs may modulate HBV-specific T- and B-cell responses in vivo, which are essential for the termination of HBV infection. Thus, TLR agonists are promising candidates to act as immunomodulators for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. Antiviral treatment may recover TLR expression and function in chronic HBV infection and may increase the efficacy of therapeutic approaches based on TLR activation. A combined therapeutic strategy with antiviral treatment and TLR activation could facilitate the restoration of HBV-specific immune responses and thereby, achieve viral clearance in chronically infected HBV patients."
54,0.002,2.0,"The etiology of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in renal dialysis patients was determined. Hepatitis C virus was present in many, but its appearance did not correlate with elevated alanine aminotransaminase. When sera from these patients were tested for antibodies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) X antigen and polymerase, 70% were positive. HBV infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using several HBV-specific primer pairs. However, amplification with X region primers failed to yield products in many patients. Cloning and sequencing of these products demonstrated deletions within the X region. Hence, X-deletion variants of HBV are strongly associated with NANBH in renal dialysis patients."
4157,0.002,2.0,"The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of entecavir in kidney- and liver-transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Ten male transplant patients with chronic HBV infection (eight kidney- and two liver-transplant patients), who have become adefovir (n=9) or lamivudine-resistant (n=1) were given entecavir at 0.5 to 1 mg/d. All patients were HBs Ag positive: six were HBe Ag(-)/HBe Ab(+), and four were HBe Ag(+)/HBe Ab(-). After a median follow-up of 16.5 months, entecavir therapy was associated with a significant decrease in HBV DNA viral load, that is, 3.86 (2.71-6.46) log10 copies/mL at baseline down to 2.94 (2.15-4) log10 copies/mL at last follow-up (P=0.004). Rate of HBV DNA clearance was 50% in both HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(-) patients. There were no significant changes in renal function or hematological parameters. This study demonstrates that entecavir therapy is safe and efficient in HBV(+) organ-transplant patients."

2193,0.002,2.0,"Before the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) represented one of the most prevalent causes of focal brain lesions in HIV-infected people. The prognosis of PCNSL was very poor, with median survival time not exceeding 2 months. Brain biopsy was the method of choice for the definitive diagnosis, but it was and remains an invasive procedure with morbidity and mortality as well as considerable costs in terms of patients' management and quality of life. The strict association between AIDS-PCNSL and Epstein-Barr virus led to the suggestion that EBV DNA in cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) might serve as a diagnostic marker, reducing the time required for diagnosis and allowing a minimally invasive approach. The clinical usefulness of this methodology has been largely demonstrated through clinical practice. After the introduction of HAART in clinical practice, a survival benefit has been observed for most persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated opportunistic infections and cancers. In particular, for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a higher likelihood of response to chemotherapy as well as a longer survival has been found as a consequence of the use of combined antiretroviral therapy. Although larger studies did not show significant changes in survival of HIV-infected patients with PCNSL in the era of HAART, small case series and anecdotal reports showed the benefit of HAART in the treatment of PCNSL. Nevertheless, these patients' survival still remains very poor and it could be hypothesized that, other than specific cancer prognostic determinants and severe immunodeficiency, viral pathogenesis as well as EBV-specific immunologic dysfunction may be responsible."
3340,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study is to investigate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who are homeless or unstably housed. We evaluated homeless or unstably housed PLWHA (n=644) in three US cities were enrolled in the Housing and Health Study. Using baseline data and controlling for gender, race, age, and education, we examined associations between self-reported two- and Seven-day adherence and access to healthcare, mental health, substance use, and attitudes toward HIV medical therapy. Of the 644 participants, 358 (55%) were currently on HAART. For two-day adherence, 280 (78%) reported missing no prescribed doses (100% adherence), and for seven-day adherence, 291 (81%) reported > or =90% adherence. Logistic regression analyses indicated being younger, not having health insurance, and drug use were associated with missing > or =1 dose over the past two days. Scoring lower on SF-36 mental component summary scale and having greater risk of depression (CES-D) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) were associated with poorer adherence for both two- and seven-day outcomes. Negative attitudes toward HIV treatment were also associated with lower adherence. Adherence to HIV medications in this population is similar to other groups. Coexisting problems of access to healthcare, higher risk of mental health problems, along with poorer attitudes toward treatment are associated with increased likelihood of missing doses. Comprehensive models of HIV care that include a continuum of medical and social services are essential for treating this population."
800,0.002,2.0,"AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (AKS) is particularly aggressive and it is one of the principal neoplasms in regions of Africa affected by both high endemic HHV8 and epidemic HIV infection. In this study, serum samples from 18 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma from Tanzania, mostly males (n = 15 vs 3), were subjected to analysis with respect to HHV8-DNA load and antibody spectrum against the HIV-1 tat protein. Of the 18 patients, 14 were HIV-1-positive. The median HHV8 virus load in the HIV-1-positive group was 2075 DNA copies/ml, compared to 450 copies/ml in the HIV-1-negative group. In the HIV-1-positive group, the males had a higher HHV8-DNA virus load as compared to females (median: 4600 vs 1400 genome copies per ml). Since tat can promote AKS development (4-6) by intercellular signalling pathways, and these signals can be abolished by anti-tat IgG (7-9), we have examined the anti-tat IgG spectrum in this study. It would be expected that the levels of serum HHV8-DNA are higher in KS patients who have low anti-tat IgG titer, or who are anti-tat IgG-negative. In the present study, seven out of fifteen AKS patients were positive for anti-tat IgG. Although, we have not seen a strict quantitative relationship between serum anti-tat IgG and HHV8-DNA levels, our data appear to suggest a correlation between the two parameters. In view of these observations and the published data, we suggest that cross-signalling pathways between the tat protein and HHV8-DNA are involved in the complexity of pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma."
5589,0.002,2.0,"To investigate the infectivity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from mothers to their newborn offspring, HBV-DNA in plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells from 28 antihepatitis Be positive, hepatitis B surface antigen positive carrier mothers was examined by a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction/Southern hybridisation technique. HBV specific DNA was detected in three maternal mononuclear cell samples, but was absent in plasma. Two of four infants born to the three mothers with HBV-DNA positive mononuclear cells developed acute or fulminant hepatitis within three months after birth. Two infants were effectively prevented from infection with HBV by combined hepatitis B immunoglobulin/HBV vaccine administration. The 25 infants born to the HBV-DNA negative mothers were free of HBV infection within the next seven months to 3.5 years. These results suggest that latent infection with HBV in maternal mononuclear cells is responsible for perinatal HBV infection."
5834,0.002,2.0,"Aim of the study was to investigate serological markers of selected sexually and blood transmitted infections (HBV, HCV, CMV, and Treponema pallidum) in the group of pregnant women and in newborns of HIV-positive mothers in Slovakia. IgG antibodies to CMV were found in 78 of 97 women, from them in 6 of 7 HIV-positive and in 72 of 90 HIV-negative persons. Occurrence of HbsAg and HCV was significantly higher in the group of HIV-positive women (1/7 and 2/7) comparing to the HIV-negative one (4/90 and 0/92, respectively). Antibodies to T. pallidum were found only in one HIV-negative woman from 92 women tested. Five of seven children born to HIV-1 infected mothers were found HIV-1 negative, two children are still under control. Four of 7 newborns were found anti-CMV IgG positive. Although one woman, IDU, was confirmed HbsAg and anti-HCV positive, vertical transmission of HBV and HCV to her newborn was not observed by molecular-biological methods. Similarly, HCV antibodies were found in one more women and neither in her child HCV infection was confirmed. In no one of mother - child pair's antibodies to T. pallidum were observed. Due to these findings strong attention should be paid to health education and prophylaxis of mother to child HIV and other STIs transmission in Slovakia."
6712,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection imposes an enormous public health burden. In patients with chronic hepatitis and high levels of viral replication, inhibitors of the virus polymerase can reduce serum titre and favourably affect the inflammatory process in the liver. Lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is the first nucleoside analogue to be licensed for treatment of chronic HBV infection. Treatment effects a rapid and profound decrease of serum virus titre, with attendant clinical benefit. Unfortunately drug-resistant species may emerge after 6 months of suppressive therapy. Lamivudine-resistant species have specific amino acid substitutions in the HBV-encoded polymerase. Emergence of these species is frequently associated with loss of clinical benefit. Published data suggest that lamivudine-resistant species exhibit cross-resistance to famciclovir, thereby limiting the potential use of famciclovir with lamivudine as combination therapy. Adefovir is under clinical evaluation for treatment of wild-type and lamivudine-resistant HBV. Preliminary data suggest that adefovir achieves potent inhibition of both species. Studies of drug resistance have followed hot-on-the-heels of the development of potent antiviral therapy for chronic HBV."
3118,0.002,2.0,"Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of this association is unclear. In this study, we examined the potential defects in upstream insulin signaling pathways in liver specimens obtained from nonobese/nondiabetic subjects with HCV infection. Fasting liver biopsy specimens were obtained from 42 HCV-infected subjects and 10 non-HCV-infected subjects matched for age and body mass index. Liver tissues were exposed to insulin and examined for the contents and phosphorylation/activation status of the upstream insulin signaling molecules by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. HCV infection resulted in a trend toward a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 contents when compared with non-HCV. In contrast, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased by 2-fold in HCV-infected subjects compared with non-HCV-infected subjects (P <.05). The observed reductions in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation were accompanied by a 3.4-fold decrease in IRS-1/p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) association and a 2.5-fold decrease in IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase enzymatic activity (P <.05 vs. non-HCV). This was accompanied by a marked reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation without any alterations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation. Cellular contents of the hepatic p85 subunit of PI3-kinase were comparable between HCV-infected and non-HCV-infected subjects. In conclusion, we found that (1). HCV infection leads to a postreceptor defect in IRS-1 association with the IR and (2). insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase association/activation may contribute to insulin resistance, which leads to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with HCV infection."
6136,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), use of insulin and statins was associated with reduced cancer risk while co-presence of low LDL cholesterol (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l) plus low triglyceride (TG; <1.7 mmol/l) increased cancer risk. There is experimental evidence showing that insulin insufficiency might promote HCC. In this study, we examined whether this lipid subphenotype and use of insulin or statins might modify the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection (indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) on HCC. We analyzed data of 1319 T2D patients enrolled into the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry from December 1996 to January 2005 and followed up to 2005. Additive interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction and attributable proportion due to interaction. During 5782 person-years of follow-up, 1.74% (n=23) of patients developed HCC (incidence, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-5.60/1000 person-years). HbA1c ≥7.0% and the lipid phenotype (LDLC <2.8 mmol/l plus TG <1.7 mmol/l) increased the hazard ratios (HRs) of chronic HBV infection for HCC from 3.74 to 74.96 and from 11.01 to 89.82 respectively with significant interactions. Use of insulin or statins decreased the HRs from 37.51 to 5.87 and from 64.94 to 16.99 respectively with significant interactions (all P values <0.05). These findings support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia and co-presence of low LDLC plus low TG might enhance, while insulin or statin usage might attenuate the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection on HCC in T2D."
2224,0.002,2.0,"CXCR4 is the major co-receptor used by X4 strains of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1). In HIV-1-infected patients, the appearance of X4 strains (T cell line-tropic) correlates with disease progression. Since its discovery, the CXCR4 co-receptor has been a major target for different agents which block its function, such as stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and the anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, 12G5. In the present studies, the 12G5 hybridoma was used to construct a single-chain variable antibody fragment (SFv). Murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian virus 40 (SV(40)) were utilized as delivery vehicles for the anti-CXCR4 SFv. Intracellular expression of the anti-CXCR4 SFv led to down-regulation of this critical co-receptor, as demonstrated by immunostaining. This effect significantly and specifically protected transduced cells from challenge with HIV-1, as measured by HIV-1 p24 antigen expression. Inhibition of HIV-1 replication was specific for X4 HIV-1 strains as demonstrated by MAGI assays. HeLa-CD4/betagal-CCR5 cells expressing the anti-CXCR4 SFv showed significant inhibition of infectivity by the X4 HIV-1 strain NL4-3, but not with the R5 HIV-1 strain Bal. Thus, this anti-HIV-1 molecular therapy has the potential to inhibit HIV-1 replication and virion spread. Targeting CXCR4 by intracellular immunization could be of additional benefit to certain HIV-1-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
9466,0.002,2.0,"The pressing need for broad-spectrum antivirals could be met by targeting host rather than viral processes. Cholesterol biosynthesis within the infected cell is one promising target for a large number of viral systems, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV. Liposomes developed for intracellular, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted in vivo drug delivery have been modified to include polyunsaturated fatty acids that exert an independent antiviral activity through the reduction of cellular cholesterol. These polyunsaturated ER liposomes (PERLs) have greater activity than lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), which is clinically approved for lowering cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease. Treatment of HCV, HBV, and HIV infections with PERLs significantly decreased viral secretion and infectivity, and pretreatment of naïve cells reduced the ability of both HCV and HIV to establish infections because of the decreased levels of plasma membrane cholesterol. Direct competition for cellular receptors was an added effect of PERLs against HCV infections. The greatest antiviral activity in all three systems was the inhibition of viral infectivity through the reduction of virus-associated cholesterol. Our study demonstrates that PERLs are a broadly effective antiviral therapy and should be developed further in combination with encapsulated drug mixtures for enhanced in vivo efficacy."
260,0.002,2.0,"In this study, we report on the efficacy of using a spleen necrosis virus (SNV)-based vector delivery system to block human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) replication in human hematopoietic cells. These efforts were directed towards the development of human immune system cell resistance to HIV-1 infection, based on the strategy of ""intracellular immunization"" via generation of a series of anti-HIV-1 therapeutic constructs carrying scFvs, single-chain variable fragments, against HIV-1 integrase and reverse transcriptase in combination with the trans-dominant mutant of HIV-1 Rev, RevM10. The efficiency of the anti-HIV-1 constructs were tested in viral challenge assays with different doses of HIV-1 NL4-3, Bal, 89.6 and R7-GFP strains. These experiments demonstrated the reduction of HIV-1 replication by these retroviral vector constructs in a range of 4- to 10-fold in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and primary human macrophages. We observed selective efficiency of SNV-based therapeutics in H9, C8166 and Jurkat T-lymphocytic cell lines, demonstrating the most efficient inhibition of HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T-cells. Thus, these data are the first demonstration of the ability of SNV-based retroviral vectors with select transgenes, which may have certain molecular advantages over other retroviral vector systems, to combat HIV-1 replication in human hematopoietic cells and support the potential for using SNV-expressed constructs in anti-HIV-1 molecular therapeutics."
2529,0.002,2.0,"Although newer and more effective treatments are now available for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, non-HCV viral hepatitis remains an important cause of liver disease, especially among HIV-infected individuals. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide, and approximately one-quarter of patients with cirrhosis develop decompensated liver disease within 5 years. Initial treatment for chronic HBV infection includes peginterferon alfa, entecavir, and tenofovir. Approximately 15 million of the estimated 350 million individuals with chronic HBV infection have evidence of exposure to hepatitis D (delta) virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B surface antigen for transmission and packaging. HBV/HDV coinfection is associated with more severe acute hepatitis and higher mortality than acute HBV monoinfection. Chronic coinfection is associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease. The mainstay of treatment for HDV infection is peginterferon alfa for at least 48 weeks. Cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection in HIV-infected persons have been reported. HEV infection can become chronic in immunosuppressed patients, and chronic infection is associated with rapid development of cirrhosis. There are no established guidelines for treating HEV infection in HIV-infected persons. This article summarizes a presentation by Jennifer Price, MD, at the IAS-USA continuing education program held in San Francisco, California, in June 2013. "
7110,0.002,2.0,"Forty-five antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 infected patients and 14 healthy controls in North China were enrolled in this study. The frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and levels of expression of CD95, HLA-DR and CD38 in T cells were detected by flow cytometry. We found that the frequency of Tregs was higher in AIDS patients than in asymptomatic HIV-1 infected patients (P=0.004). The frequency of Tregs was significantly correlated with absolute CD4 count, viral load, CD4+CD95+ T cells and CD8+CD95+ T cells (P<0.05). The relationship between the frequency of Tregs and immune activation was not found in HIV-infected patients. We concluded that the frequency of Tregs in HIV-infected Chinese patients was significantly correlated with disease progression."

HHV-6 and HCMV were assessed in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 26 lung transplant recipients and of 37 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, to determine the degree of concordance between HHV-6 and HCMV reactivation in different biologic settings. In the lung transplant recipients (145 samples), HHV-6 was not detected, even though 44 (30%) of 145 samples were from 9 HCMV DNA-positive patients (13 episodes of HCMV pneumonitis). Among the HIV-infected patients (172 samples), HCMV DNA was detected in 29 (17%) of 172 samples from 10 patients (4 episodes of HCMV disease). HHV-6 DNA was detected in 2 HIV-infected patients who did not have HCMV detected at that time. These findings suggest that the pathobiologic control mechanisms for these 2 beta-herpesviruses may be significantly different."

With the recent advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), those infected with HIV are now living longer and dying from illnesses other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although studies prior to the HAART era suggested poor outcomes might occur with transplantation in those infected with HIV, more recent studies have demonstrated results comparable to those of recipients without HIV infection. A number of issues persist regarding ethics, patient selection, post-operative management, and drug interactions between antiretroviral and immunosuppression agents.

Eight hundred and eight members (56% neurologists, 43% physiatrists; 97% practicing physicians, 3% trainees) responded, with a response rate of 22% (808 of 3659). The mean number of years in practice, involving electromyography (EMG) at least 1 day per week, was 16 years. A majority of physicians (64%) reported at least one needlestick injury involving EMG, and 8% reported five or more injuries. Needlestick injuries involving patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), hepatitis B, and/or hepatitis C occurred in 1 of every 11 electromyographers. Nearly half of all respondents (44%) who experienced a needlestick injury stated that they did not report at least one injury event to official centers. Injuries were most likely to occur during a routine procedure (45%) or when a patient moved (26%). The most common preventable reason for injury was a perceived lack of time."
2054,0.002,2.0,"Human DNA flanking sites of eight human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral integrations have been analyzed in isolates derived both from integrations in an infected individual and from tissue culture. Sequence analysis encompassing 80-3000 bp of human DNA on one or both sides of the site of integration revealed that seven of the eight HIV-1 proviruses had integrated directly into or within one nucleosome's distance from an L1Hs or Alu repetitive element. To compare this with the frequency at which human L1 or Alu elements sharing > or = 70% identity with L1Hs and Alu consensus sequences would be encountered at random, > 200 bp from each of 82 individual anonymously cloned segments of human DNA were sequenced: L1Hs elements were encountered in 8.5% of the 82 clones and Alu elements were encountered in 13.4+ by using these homology windows. From these data it appears that HIV-1 integrates into or near L1Hs elements with an approximately 6-fold higher frequency than would be expected if HIV-1 integration events were distributed uniformly throughout the genome. A cumulative binomial probability test shows that there is a 0.26% chance that one would arrive at these figures by chance and puts the data well within a 99% confidence interval. We propose that sites of L1Hs and Alu insertions originally occurred in regions of chromatin that were more easily accessible to the retroposon machinery and that these regions are now acting as preferred integration sites for HIV-1."
1369,0.002,2.0,"Sequences at the ends of linear retroviral cDNA important for integration define the viral DNA attachment (att) site. Whereas determinants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase important for replication in T lymphocytes have been extensively characterized, regions of the att site important for viral spread have not been thoroughly examined. Previous transposon-mediated footprinting of preintegration complexes isolated from infected cells revealed enhanced regions of bacteriophage Mu insertion near the ends of HIV-1 cDNA, in the regions of the att sites. Here, we identified the subterminal cDNA sequences cleaved during in vitro footprinting and used this structure-based information together with results of previous work to construct and characterize 24 att site mutant viruses. We found that although subterminal cDNA sequences contributed to HIV-1 replication, the identities of these bases were not critical for integration. In contrast, the phylogenetically conserved CA dinucleotides located at the ends of HIV-1 contributed significantly to virus replication and integration. Mutants containing one intact CA end displayed delays in peak virus growth compared to the wild type. In contrast, double mutant viruses lacking both CAs were replication defective. The A of the CA appeared to be the most critical determinant of integration, because two different U5 mutant viruses containing the substitution of TG for CA partially reverted by changing the G back to A. We also identified a U5 deletion mutant in which the CA played a crucial role in reverse transcription."

After 28 days, 54 responding subjects entered an open-label extension that allowed for the addition of nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase and dose escalation to maintain durability. The drug was well-tolerated and demonstrated robust antiviral activity, with demonstrable superiority of the 750 mg and 1000 mg three times daily regimens. Thirty subjects who continued to receive therapy at 12 months attained a persistent 1.6 log10 reduction in HIV RNA, accompanied by a mean increase in CD4 cells of 180-200/mm3. Studies of viral genotype and phenotype after virus rebound revealed that the initial active site mutation allowing for nelfinavir resistance is mediated by a unique amino acid substitution in the HIV-1 protease D30N, which does not confer in vitro phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently available protease inhibitors."
5316,0.002,2.0,"The prognosis of decompensated cirrhosis of liver resulting from chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is poor and liver transplantation is the only established mode of treatment. The benefits of treatment with interferon are outweighed by serious side effects and risks of fatal exacerbation of disease activity. Lamivudine rapidly reduces hepatitis B viral DNA in serum to undetectable levels. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effectiveness and safety of Lamivudine treatment in patients with advanced and end stage liver disease caused by Hepatitis B. This was a prospective observational study in which a total of 45 patients, 39 (87.0%) male and 6 (13.0%) female who had viral activity and child pugh score e"" 8 were given Lamivudine 100 mg orally once daily. Among them 30 patients completed at least 6 months of therapy, majority (27 patients) showed improvement in liver function with decrease in serum ALT from mean (+/- SD) 118.8 +/- 106.5 to 50.2 +/- 57.1 U/L (p < 0.001), decrease in serum bilirubin from 73.9 +/- 80.5 to 44.7 +/- 62.9 micromol/l (p = 0.129), increase in serum albumin from 26.2 +/- 4.2 to 33.2 +/- 3.4 g/l (p < 0.05), decrease in prothrombin time from 8.3 +/- 4.0 to 3.9 +/- 2.9 seconds prolonged (p < 0.05) and reduction in child pugh score from 11.0 +/- 1.7 to 7.0 +/- 1.3 (p < 0.001). Seroconversion was found in 5 (11.1%) patients on Intention to treat analysis. Among the seroconverted group, 1 (2.2%) patient also lost HBsAg. Six (13.0%) patient had procore mutant virus, 2 (4.4%) of them showed virological response. Therefore, total 7 (15.5%) patients showed virological response by intention to treat analysis. We conclude that inhibition of viral replication with Lamivudine results in a significant improvement of liver function in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of liver due to HBV infection."
3718,0.002,2.0,"Phylogenetic analysis was used to study in vivo genetic variation of the V3 region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in relation to disease progression in six infants with vertically acquired human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. Nucleotide sequences from each infant formed a monophyletic group with similar average branch lengths separating the sets of sequences. In contrast to the star-shaped phylogeny characteristic of interinfant viral evolution, the shape of the phylogeny formed by sequences from the infants who developed AIDS tended to be linear. A computer program, DISTRATE, was written to analyze changes in DNA distance values over time. For the six infants, the rate of divergence from the initial variant was inversely correlated with CD4 cell counts averaged over the first 11 to 15 months of life (r = -0.87, P = 0.024). To uncover evolutionary relationships that might be dictated by protein structure and function, tree-building methods were applied to inferred amino acid sequences. Trees constructed from the full-length protein fragment (92 amino acids) showed that viruses from each infant formed a monophyletic group. Unexpectedly, V3 loop protein sequences (35 amino acids) that were found at later time points from the two infants who developed AIDS clustered together. Furthermore, these sequences uniquely shared amino acids that have been shown to confer a T-cell line tropic phenotype. The evolutionary pattern suggests that viruses from these infants with AIDS acquired similar and possibly more virulent phenotypes."
5023,0.002,2.0,"To assess the interaction of alcohol, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in hepatocarcinogenesis, we prospectively observed 449 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) who presented to our outpatient clinics in 1 month; 164 patients with habitual drinking [alcoholic liver-liver cirrhosis (AL-LC)] who had taken > 72 g alcohol/day (HCV-positive 81 cases: HCV + AL; HCV-negative 83 cases: AL); 176 patients with HCV infection, but without alcohol intake: 34 patients with HBV infection: 6 patients with HCV and HBV coinfection; and 82 patients with liver diseases from other etiologies, such as primary biliary cirrhosis. In the HCV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 9%, 18%, and 23% in the first, second, and third years, respectively. In the HCV + AL group, that was 13%, 17%, and 28%, respectively. There was no difference in the HCC occurrence rate between the two groups. In the AL group, the cumulative HCC occurrence rate was only 1% during the observation period of 3 years. The occurrence rate was significantly lower in the AL group, compared with the HCV and the HCV + AL groups. In the HBV group, the cumulative occurrence rate of HCC during the observation period of 3 years was 17%, which was similar to that of the HBV + AL group, 14%. We also examined some other variables that might be related to the development of HCC. The cumulative occurrence rate of HCC in male patients was 31%, whereas that was 18% in female patients. In the HCV group, there was a significant increase of HCC occurrence rate in male patients. In contrast, no difference was observed in the HCC occurrence rate between male and female patients in the HBV group. The present study suggests that alcohol alone may not be an independent risk factor for HCC, nor does it accelerate HCC development in LC patients with HCV and HBV infection during the prospective observation of 3 years."
6095,0.002,2.0,"The process of T-cell activation in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers has been investigated by measurement of membrane expression of lymphocyte-activation markers in response to a variety of mitogenic stimuli in order to delineate further the abnormality of T-cell-mediated immunity present in such patients. A substantial proportion of unstimulated T cells from the peripheral blood of patients but not controls expressed HLA-DR; in contrast the IL-2 and transferrin receptors were rarely expressed spontaneously in either group and there was no difference in spontaneous lymphocyte transformation. After stimulation with monocyte-dependent T-cell mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or anti-T3, patients had significantly reduced expression of the IL-2 and transferrin receptors and of HLA-DR in association with impaired lymphocyte transformations compared to controls. In contrast, lymphocyte activation was normal in response to the monocyte-independent T-cell mitogen phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). These data confirm that the process of T-cell activation is abnormal in chronic HBV carriers but suggest that the T cell is intrinsically normal. In allogeneic co-cultures, monocytes from patients inhibited the transformation of normal and patients' lymphocytes in response to PHA, suggesting that defects of T-cell-mediated immunity in chronic HBV carriers may be a consequence of monocyte dysfunction."
5568,0.002,2.0,"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm(3) and/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age >25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. "
8150,0.002,2.0,"Patients in whom virologic suppression is achieved with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) retain long-lived cellular reservoirs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1); this retention is an obstacle to sustained control of infection. To assess the impact that initiating treatment during primary HIV-1 infection has on this cell population, we analyzed the decay kinetics of HIV-1 DNA and of infectivity associated with cells activated ex vivo in 27 patients who initiated therapy before or <6 months after seroconversion and in whom viremia was suppressed to <50 copies/mL. The clearance rates of cellular reservoirs could not be distinguished by these techniques (median half-life, 20 weeks) during the first year of HAART. The clearance of HIV-1 DNA slowed significantly during the subsequent 3 years of treatment (median half-life, 70 weeks), consistent with heterogeneous cellular reservoirs being present. Total cell-associated infectivity (CAI) after 1 year of treatment was undetectable (<0.07 infectious units/million cells [IUPM]) in most patients initiating treatment during primary infection either before (9/9) or <6 months after (6/8) seroconversion. In contrast, all 17 control patients who initiated HAART during chronic infection retained detectable CAI after 3-6 years of treatment (median reservoir size, 1.1 IUPM; P<.0005). These results suggest that treatment <6 months after seroconversion may facilitate long-term control of cellular reservoirs that maintain HIV-1 infection during treatment."
7609,0.002,2.0,"Opportunistic diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) leading to immune reconstitution is the most effective treatment of preventing opportunistic diseases. This retrospective study established an epidemiologic profile of opportunistic diseases 10 years after the introduction of HAART. The HIV antiretroviral therapy-naive patients matching inclusion criteria were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of opportunistic diseases. From January 1, 2002 to September 30, 2010, 654 opportunistic diseases were identified in 458 patients. Pulmonary tuberculosis, herpes zoster, cerebral toxoplasmosis, oral candidiasis, and severe pneumonia accounted for 22.05%, 15.94%, 14.19%, 14.19%, and 9.39%, respectively. Cryptococcal meningitis and pneumocystosis accounted for 0.44% and 0.21%, respectively. The prevalence of opportunistic diseases in Gabon remains high. New guidelines emphasize the importance of initiating antiretroviral therapy early to reconstitute the immune system, and reduce disease risk, and treat the primary opportunistic infection of pulmonary tuberculosis."
5448,0.002,2.0,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon of paradoxical worsening of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) upon initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To date, there have been limited reports of IRIS in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, the authors describe a 43-year-old man with AIDS who presented with subacute meningitis. No pathogenic organism was identified by routine diagnostic tests, and he was treated empirically with an antituberculous regimen and initiated on HAART therapy. Soon after, he had a precipitous neurologic decline leading to his death. Postmortem evaluation showed a basilar Candida meningitis as well as vasculitis characterized by CD8+ T-cell infiltration, consistent with IRIS. The authors discuss the challenges in diagnosing fungal meningitides and the risks of initiating HAART therapy in those with possible undiagnosed underlying opportunistic infections. Additionally, the authors review the literature regarding CNS IRIS."
1160,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the psychosocial changes revealed by persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in western Uganda as a result of the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Fourteen participants were interviewed on two occasions. Two focus groups discussions were also conducted. Patients experienced important personal benefits as a result of HAART and the resulting clinical improvement. These benefits included a restoration of hope, self-esteem and personal agency. Patients were also relieved of the great fear which they had about the conditions of their death. The financial and social struggles introduced by AIDS illness continued after the introduction of HAART. The conclusion is that the HAART programs should provide more holistic care to patients to address the persistent family issues identified in this study. "

8854,0.002,2.0,"Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been a major global health problem for almost 3 decades, with the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996 and effective prophylaxis and management of opportunistic infections, mortality from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has decreased markedly. In developed countries, this condition is now being treated as a chronic condition. As a result, rates of morbidity and mortality from other medical conditions leading to end-stage liver, kidney, and heart disease are steadily increasing in individuals with HIV. Because the definitive treatment for end-stage organ failure is transplantation, the demand for it has increased among HIV-infected patients. For these reasons, many transplant centers have eliminated HIV infection as a contraindication to transplantation, as a result of better patient management and demand."
1690,0.002,2.0,"Recent advances in the knowledge of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and transmission as well as the emergence of effective antiretroviral therapies are leading to longer survival times for HIV-infected individuals. As a result, organ related manifestations of late stage HIV infection, including HIV-related heart diseases have emerged. It is now clear that cardiac involvement in HIV seropositive patients is relatively common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac involvement in HIV infection is multifactorial. The epidemiology has changed dramatically since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but studies carried out before the introduction of HAART remain relevant because of limited access to this treatment in many areas of the world. A variety of cardiac lesions have been reported in HIV infection and AIDS, including pericardial disease with effusion and tamponade, nonspecific or infectious myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy with global left ventricular dysfunction, endocardial valvular disease due to marantic or infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension and neoplastic invasion. In the post HAART-era, coronary artery disease and dyslipidaemia, drug related cardiotoxicity and cardiac autonomic dysfunction are becoming increasingly prevalent. In this review, we highlight the importance of cardiac complications in HIV disease and discuss measures that can be taken to improve survival."

Of 6,095 patients, 13.8% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen positive (HBsAg(+)) and 17.0% were positive for anti-HCV (anti-HCV(+)). Infection was found to be inversely related to educational level and to be directly related to the frequency of the receipt of parenteral injection for medical purposes. Risk factors for HBsAg positivity were male sex, age < or = 50 years, and a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for HCV seropositivity were lower education level, frequent parenteral injections, blood transfusion, menial occupations, smoking, and age > 50 years. Therefore, risk factors for HBsAg(+) and anti-HCV(+) were different in these Taiwanese communities. Safe medical injections and improved health education for high-risk groups are imperative for preventing HCV transmission."

Three hundred and thirteen of 325 students (96%) participated. The mean age was 24.3+/-3.98 years; 231 (74%) were pre-clinical students and 82 (26%) were in the clinical years of study. Only 8 (2.6%) had received three doses of vaccination against HBV. Eighty-one (26%) tested positive for anti-HBc, 10 (3.2%) were positive for HBsAg and 56 (17.9%) had anti-HBs antibodies. A significant relationship was found between students who had a positive history of hepatitis B in the family and anti-HBc (P=0.03). Age was also significantly associated with HBsAg (P=0.012). Two hundred and twenty-five (72%) students were susceptible to the infection and required vaccination. Most students at this medical school are susceptible to HBV infection and should be vaccinated."
6952,0.002,2.0,"The plasma human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA load is used in the clinical routine for the monitoring of HIV infection and the patient's response to antiretroviral therapy. Other body fluids or dried blood spots (DBS) can be used, however, to assess the level of viremia. The use of DBS may be especially helpful for the monitoring of HIV-infected patients in resource-poor settings, where access to adequate laboratory facilities is often difficult. However, the correlation between the HIV RNA levels in plasma and those in DBSs has not been well established. Paired plasma and DBS samples obtained from HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients were tested for HIV RNA copy numbers by using two different commercial assays, the Nuclisens EasyQ HIV-1 (version 1.1) test (the Nuclisens test; Biomerieux) and the m2000rt RealTime HIV test (the m2000rt test; Abbott). Nucleic acid extraction was performed manually by using either the Nuclisens isolation kit (which uses the Boom methodology) or the m2000rt sample preparation kit (an iron particle-based method). A total of 103 paired plasma and DBS samples were tested. Viral load results were obtained for 97 (94.2%) samples with the Nuclisens isolation kit and 81 (78.6%) samples with the m2000rt kit. The overall correlation between the RNA loads in plasma and DBS was good, although better results were obtained by the Nuclisens test (R(2) = 0.87, P < 0.001) than by the m2000rt test (R(2) = 0.70, P < 0.001). While the specificities were excellent and similar for both the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests (97.1% and 100%, respectively), the sensitivity was greater by the Nuclisens test than by the m2000rt test (75.8% and 56.6%, respectively). Overall, the viral loads in DBS tended to be lower than those in plasma, with mean differences of 0.3 log unit (standard deviation, 0.5 log unit) and 0.76 log unit (standard deviation, 0.8 log unit) for the Nuclisens and the m2000rt tests, respectively. The levels of agreement between the measurements in plasma and DBS were assessed by using the Bland-Altman plot for each assay. The Nuclisens test gave results within its defined limits (-0.65 to 1.26) for 95.9% of the samples, while the m2000rt test gave results within its limits (-0.83 to 2.33) for 100% of the samples. In summary, the HIV-1 load can accurately be quantified by testing DBS by either the Nuclisens or the m2000rt test, although the Nuclisens test may outperform the m2000rt test when nucleic acids are extracted manually."

Several structural investigations have already been reported to reveal the molecular mechanism of the drug resistance. As full length crystal structure for HIV-1 integrase is still unsolved, we herein use the crystal structure of the full length prototype foamy virus (PFV) in complex with virus DNA and inhibitor Elvitegravir as a template to construct the wild type and E92Q/N155H mutant system of HIV-1 integrase. Molecular dynamic simulations was used to revel the binding mode and the drug resistance of the EVG ligand in E92Q/N155H. Several important interactions were discovered between the mutated residues and the residues in the active site of the E92Q/N155H double mutant pattern, and cross correlation and clustering methods were used for detailed analysis. The results from the MD simulation studies will be used to guide the experimental efforts of developing novel inhibitors against drug-resistant HIV integrase mutants. "

All 14 patients participated in a pharmacokinetic study in which they were hospitalized for an entire day. As a child's ability to concentrate varies over the course of the day, all tests were performed in the morning.The patients' neurocognitive development did not significantly differ from the normative collective pattern for any of the following composite scores that were examined: full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) (mean: 106.5, P = .1060), verbal comprehension index (mean: 106.0, P = .1356), perceptual reasoning index (mean: 106.0, P = .1357), working memory index (mean: 106.3, P = .1171), and processing speed index (mean: 98.1, P = .6313). The overall full-scale IQ scores were significantly higher in children who began ART within the first year of life (P = .0379), whereas low lopinavir/r plasma levels (P = .0070) and high viral load area under the curves (AUCs) in the first 3 years of life, but not later, significantly correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance (Spearman r = -0.64, P = .0278).In this cohort of cART treated HIV-positive children and adolescents, neurocognitive performance correlated with early and sufficient viral load suppression within the first 3 years of life."
7344,0.002,2.0,"Serum p24 antigen levels were examined in subjects from three clinical trials of zidovudine to determine whether the pattern of change in serum p24 antigen during the first 8-16 weeks of therapy was associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease progression or death. Among 406 patients with AIDS and a first episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, 65% had measurable pretreatment concentrations of serum p24 antigen (> or = 10 pg/mL). Changes during treatment were not associated with reduced mortality. In 637 mildly symptomatic patients, 24% had measurable concentrations, and changes were marginally associated with increased time until more advanced disease. Among 683 asymptomatic patients, 18% had measurable concentrations, and changes were not associated with increased time until progression. Despite the small number of clinical events and the low rate of serum p24 antigen positivity in the latter two studies, pretreatment serum p24 antigen levels were predictive of clinical outcome; subsequent measurements appear to be of limited use in evaluating zidovudine therapy."
36,0.002,2.0,"There is increasing evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection of an immunosuppressed host is associated with the appearance of virus mutants. To characterize the virus circulating in patients in detail, eleven full-length HBV genomes, isolated from the serum of five highly viraemic renal transplant recipients with liver disease, were cloned and sequenced. The genomes contained deletions in the C gene, deletions in the pre-S1/2 region frequently removing the pre-S2 initiation codon, premature termination codons in the pre-S1 or S region, and/or deletions/insertions in the X gene/core promoter. The mutations occurred at different positions and in various combinations; even mutant genomes circulating within a patient differed strikingly. It is concluded that long-term immunosuppression is associated with the occurrence of heterogeneous populations of partially defective HBV characterized by a specific mutation pattern. Efficient intracellular trans-complementation probably enables high virus replication in vivo."

Iron deficiency and its associated anemia may contribute to reduced energetic efficiency, lower aerobic capacity, decreased endurance, and fatigue. In practical terms, the functional limitations of iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia may affect the ability of women to participate in work, school, social, and family activities. Iron deficiency may contribute to the cycle of poverty in the inner city by limiting the ability of women to work, earn money, and afford iron-rich sources of food. Although iron supplementation may prevent or treat iron deficiency, the use of iron supplements needs to be approached with caution in women with HIV and HCV infections."
4038,0.002,2.0,"Pegylated-IFN and ribavirin remains the current treatment for chronic HCV infection in patients co-infected with HIV-1, but this regimen has low efficacy rates, particularly for HCV genotype 1/4 infection, has severe side effects and is extremely costly. Therefore, accurate prediction of treatment response is urgently required. We have recently shown that the NK cell gene, KIR2DS3 and a SNP associated with the IL28B gene synergise to increase the risk of chronic infection in primary HCV mono-infected patients. Identification of SNPs associated with the IL28B gene has also proven very powerful for predicting patient response to treatment. Patients co-infected with HIV-1 are of particular concern given they respond less well to HCV treatment, have more side effects and suffer a more rapid liver disease progression. In this study, we examined both IL28B and KIR2DS3 for their ability to predict treatment response in a cohort of HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients attending two treatment centres in Europe. We found that variation in both host genetic risk factors, IL28B and KIR2DS3, was strongly associated with sustained virological response (SVR) to treatment in our co-infected cohort (n = 149). The majority of patients who achieved a rapid virological response (RVR) achieved a SVR. However, it is currently impossible to predict treatment outcome in patients who fail to achieve an RVR. In our cohort, the presence of host genetic risk factors, IL28B-T and KIR2DS3 alleles, resulted in increased odds of treatment failure in these RVR negative patients (n = 88). Our data suggests that testing for host genetic factors will improve predicting treatment responsiveness in the clinical management of co-infected patients, and provides further evidence of the importance of the innate immune system in the immune response to HCV.

5246,0.002,2.0,"The absolute number of CD4+ lymphocytes in blood is prognostic for disease progression, yet the cell surface density of CD4 receptors or chemokine receptors on a single cell has not previously been found to be predictive of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity outcome. It has recently been shown that human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and its ligand alpha(1) proteinase inhibitor (alpha(1)PI; alpha(1)antitrypsin) act as HIV fusion cofactors. The present study shows that decreased HIV infectivity is significantly correlated with decreased cell surface density of HLE but not with decreased CD4 nor chemokine receptors. In vitro HIV infectivity outcome in this study was predicted by the surface density of HLE on mononuclear phagocytes but not on lymphocytes. The set point HLE surface density was in part determined by alpha(1)PI. Decreased circulating alpha(1)PI was correlated with increased cell surface HLE and with increased HIV infectivity. The correlation of HIV infectivity outcome with surface HLE and circulating alpha(1)PI supports the utility of these HIV cofactors in diagnostic analysis and therapeutic intervention."

A cohort of 141 homosexual or bisexual men were assessed semiannually for CD4 count, HIV RNA viral load, medical and depressive symptoms, and a neuropsychological test battery, including psychomotor speed, verbal memory, and executive function. In a mixed-effects model, increasingly potent antiretroviral therapy was associated with improvement in tests of psychomotor processing speed. This study contributes to the growing literature documenting the longitudinal benefit provided by potent antiretroviral therapy for neuropsychological function, particularly psychomotor processing speed, in patients with HIV illness."

2665,0.002,2.0,"Jet injectors may transmit blood-borne infections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To evaluate the safety of an anticontaminant disposable device which protects the jet injector apparatus, 22,714 healthy subjects were intradermally inoculated (38,162 inoculations) with a variety of vaccines. All the subjects were systematically followed-up clinically and epidemiologically for 6-18 months after inoculation; blood samples from 1619 subjects, before and 60-75 days after inoculation, were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV. Before vaccination 212 (13.09%) subjects were positive: 204 positive for HBV markers and eight for the HCV marker. None of the subjects were positive for the anti-HIV marker. During the clinico-epidemiological surveillance and the laboratory investigations mentioned above no clinical viral hepatitis B or C case and no seroconversion to positivity for HBV or HCV markers among the susceptible persons in the group were reported. Considering that in similar situations there is a theoretical risk of transmission as high as 1 per 388 to 1 per 3367 injections and that in our case 38,162 inoculations were performed in 22,714 subjects with the same Dermojet protected by the same type of anticontaminant disposable device, no contamination risk being reported, the conclusion can be reached that jet injectors can be safely used in the medical practice if they are protected by the sterile anticontaminant disposable device."
6132,0.002,2.0,"As lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women is implemented, it is important to understand the attitudes and norms affecting women's postpartum ART adherence. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study of HIV-positive postpartum women (n = 112) enrolled in a 2-year observational prospective cohort in Rwanda. Informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we conducted in-depth interviews with women whose children were 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 21-24 months of age to describe factors contributing to adherence and changes over time. Positive ART attitudes reported by women included mothers' health promotion, prevention of infant HIV infection, higher CD4 count, and improved physical appearance. Negative attitudes were few, but included side effects and the lifelong nature of treatment. Learning from people living with HIV (PLHIV) was identified as a norm facilitating adherence; ART adherence was inhibited by fear of disclosure or stigmatization in communities and clinics. Poor adherence behaviors were common immediately after HIV diagnosis, not necessarily during prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women with older children, most of whom stopped breastfeeding by 13-18 months, reported more barriers and missed doses than women with younger children. The TRA was useful in identifying the collective influence of attitudes, norms, and intentions on behavior. Findings suggest that HIV-positive women are vulnerable to poor adherence following HIV diagnosis and around the time of breastfeeding cessation. Lifelong treatment adherence can be supported through PLHIV exemplifying long-term ART use, fewer and less stigmatizing clinic visits, and counseling messages highlighting the benefits of drugs on appearance and illness prevention and incorporating biological feedback."
8174,0.002,2.0,"It has been suggested that the dimer initiation site/dimer linkage sequence (DIS/DLS) region of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA genome plays an important role at various stages of the viral life cycle. Recently we found that the duplication of the DIS/DLS region on viral RNA caused the production of partially monomeric RNAs in virions, indicating that this region indeed mediates RNA-RNA interaction. In this report, we followed up on this finding to identify the necessary and sufficient region for RNA dimerization in the virion of HIV-1. The region thus identified was 144 bases in length, extending from the junction of R/U5 and U5/L stem-loops to the end of SL4. The trans-acting responsive element, polyadenylation signal, primer binding site, upper stem-loop of U5/L, and SL2 were not needed for the function of this region. The insertion of this region into the ectopic location of the viral genome did not affect the level of virion production by transfection. However, the resultant virions contained monomerized genomes and showed drastic reductions in infectivity. A reduction was observed especially in the reverse transcription process. An attempt to generate a replication-competent virus with monomerized genome was performed by the long-term culture of mutant virus-infected cells. All recovered viruses were wild-type revertants, indicating a fatal defect of the mutation. These results suggest that genome dimerization or DIS/DLS itself also plays an important role in the early stages of virus infection."
9517,0.002,2.0,"To determine whether Korean red ginseng (KRG) has beneficial effects on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients administered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), we analyzed the CD4 T-cell count, viral load, and resistance mutations to HAART in 46 individuals. Thirteen patients harbored resistance mutations at baseline. The study population was divided into two groups: specifically, a group treated with a combination of HAART plus KRG (23 patients) and a group treated with HAART alone (23 patients). The annual increase in CD4 T-cell count in the combination group was significantly higher than that in the group treated with HAART alone (P < 0.05). Overall, 21 patients harbored resistance mutations after 3 years of therapy. Following exclusion of 13 patients displaying baseline resistance mutations, 7.1% of patients (1/14) in the combination group and 42.1% (8/19) in the HAART group were identified with resistance mutations. One patient with baseline resistance mutations in the combination group did not display resistance mutations 3 years after HAART therapy. High-level resistance mutations were significantly lower in the combination group than in the group treated with HAART alone. Five patients showed no improvement in viral copy number (26.3% [5/19]) in the combination group and 9 (45.0% [9/20]) showed no improvement in the HAART-only group. Our data support the clinical utility of KRG intake during HAART therapy."
9575,0.002,2.0,"Recurrent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. Recently, antiviral therapy, such as lamivudine, has become available for prophylaxis against HBV reactivation posttransplantation and for the treatment of HBV recurrent disease. We report our initial experience with lamivudine therapy in patients with precore mutant-associated HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation (n = 29). Outcomes were compared in three patient groups: group 1, precore mutant HBV infection not receiving lamivudine (n = 10); group 2, recurrent precore mutant HBV infection posttransplantation subsequently treated with lamivudine (n = 10); and group 3, HBV precore mutant patients undergoing liver transplantation and receiving lamivudine and low-dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) from the time of transplantation (n = 9). In group 1, HBV recurred in 9 of 10 patients, with subsequent graft loss in all 9 patients. In group 2, all patients developed HBV recurrence at a mean of 7.3 months posttransplantation and started lamivudine therapy at a median of 16 months posttransplantation. Follow-up on lamivudine therapy was for a median of 11 months. Six of these 10 patients developed mutations in the HBV polymerase gene associated with lamivudine resistance. There were two liver failure-related deaths in this group. In group 3 patients, there was one death from graft-versus-host disease. The remaining 8 patients have been followed up for a mean of 15.6 months posttransplantation, and all remain hepatitis B surface antigen negative and HBV DNA negative. In conclusion, lamivudine therapy in association with low-dose HBIG is effective in preventing HBV reactivation posttransplantation. Rescue therapy with lamivudine in patients with HBV recurrence is only moderately effective, with a 60% lamivudine resistance rate in patients treated for longer than 6 months."
5604,0.002,2.0,"Patients' deaths due to the organ donor shortage make it imperative that every suitable organ be transplanted. False-positive results of tests for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) result in lost organs. A survey of US organ procurement organizations collected the numbers of donors and ruled-out potential donors who had a positive result on an HIV test from January 1,2006, to October 31, 2008. Sixty-two percent of US organ procurement organizations participated. Of the 12397 donor/nondonor cases, 56 (0.45%) had an initial positive result on an HIV antibody or HIV nucleic acid test, and only 8 (14.3%) of those were confirmed positive. Of the false-positive results, 50% were from HIV antibody tests and 50% were from HIV nucleic acid tests. Organs are a scarce, finite, and perishable resource. Use of HIV antibody testing has produced a remarkably safe track record of avoiding HIV transmission, with 22 years of nonoccurrence between transmissions. Because false positives occur with any test, including the HIV Ab test, adding nucleic acid testing to the standard donor testing panel doubles the number of false-positive HIV test results and thus the number of medically suitable donors lost. The required HIV antibody test is 99.99% effective in preventing transmission of the HIV virus. Adding the HIV nucleic acid test to routine organ donor screening could result in as many as 761 to 1551 unnecessary deaths of patients between HIV transmission events because medically suitable organs are wasted."
5442,0.002,2.0,"To determine the effect of active tuberculosis on survival and the incidence of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study at four U.S. medical centers to compare the survival and incidence rate of opportunistic infections in 106 HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (cases) with that of 106 HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis (control subjects) but with a similar level of immunosuppression (measured by the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count) as the cases. Cases and control subjects were similar with regard to age, sex, race, previous opportunistic infection, and use of antiretroviral therapy, but they were more likely than control subjects to have a history of intravenous drug use (49 versus 19%). The mean CD4+ counts were similar for cases and control subjects (154 versus 153 cells/microliters, respectively). The incidence rate of new AIDS-defining opportunistic infections in cases was 4.0 infections per 100 person-months compared with 2.8 infections per 100 person-months in control subjects for an incidence rate ratio (RR) of 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.94-2.11). Cases also had a shorter overall survival than did controls subjects (p = 0.001). Active tuberculosis was associated with an increased risk for death (odds ratio = 2.17), even when controlling for age, intravenous drug use, previous opportunistic infection, baseline CD4+ count, and antiretroviral therapy. Although active tuberculosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression in HIV-infected patients, it may also act as a cofactor to accelerate the clinical course of HIV infection."

2635,0.002,2.0,"Cervical cancer (CC) is one of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) defining diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is thought to relate with increased acute toxicity of chemoradiotherapy (CRT).We investigated the effect of HIV status in the incidence of neutropenia associated with cisplatin-based CRT for CC and its impact in treatment completion.This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. Data collection was performed for all the consecutive stage Ib-IV CC women treated with cisplatin-based CRT from 2012 to 2016, and with known HIV status.Sixty-one patients were included, 6 were HIV+. HIV+ patients had a higher risk of neutropenia at any cycle during cisplatin CRT [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.3, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-52.3; P = .05]. Despite the absolute differences, mean neutrophil count was nonsignificantly lower in HIV+ women, both at baseline [4455/μL (interquartile range, IQR: 1830-6689) vs 6340 (IQR: 1720-18,970) for HIV-, P = .98] and at the end of treatment [1752/μL (IQR: 1100-2930) vs 3147/μL (IQR: 920-18,390) in HIV-; P = .06]. Moreover, when considering the effect of time, CRT seems to induce a consistent drop of neutrophils in both groups (P = .229). No febrile neutropenia events occurred.In HIV+ women, there were more CT cycle delays (P = .013), patients were more prone to use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; HIV+ 40.0% vs HIV- 4.0%; P = .04) and less likely to complete at least 5 cycles of cisplatin (P = .02). All patients received adequate dose of pelvic RT, regardless of HIV status.HIV+ patients have a significantly increased risk of neutropenia during CRT treatment for CC and are less likely to complete chemotherapy with cisplatin."

3639,0.002,2.0,"Abstract Our objective was to evaluate the liver toxicity of antiretroviral regimens including fosamprenavir plus ritonavir (FPV/r) 1400/100 mg once daily (QD) in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. This was a prospective cohort study that included 117 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients who started FPV/r 1400/100 mg QD-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who neither had received a previous antiretroviral regimen containing FPV nor had a past history of virologic failure while receiving protease inhibitors (PI). The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of grade 3-4 liver enzymes elevations (LEE) within 1 year after starting FPV/r QD. Factors potentially associated with grade 3-4 LEE, including baseline liver fibrosis, were analyzed. Eleven (9%) patients had a grade 3-4 LEE during the follow-up, resulting in an incidence of severe liver toxicity of 9% (95% confidence interval 4.1-14.6%). None of these cases led to FPV/r discontinuation. Baseline liver fibrosis could be assessed in 97 (83%) patients. Six of 71 patients (8%) with significant fibrosis had a grade 3-4 LEE versus 2 of 26 (8%) without significant fibrosis (p=1.0). Twenty (21%) patients had cirrhosis at baseline. There were no cases of LEE among cirrhotics. In conclusion, the incidence of severe liver toxicity after 1 year of therapy with FPV/r QD-based ART in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients is similar to what has been reported with other boosted PIs. In addition, the presence of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis was not associated with the emergence of liver toxicity. Thus, ART regimens containing FPV/r QD may be considered safe in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, including those with cirrhosis."
4135,0.002,2.0,"Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinomas are major health problems of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To date, rare model has reproduced liver fibrosis associated with long-term HBV infection which in turn has hindered both the understanding of HBV biology and the development of new treatment options. Here, using adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) mediated delivery of a 1.2-kb HBV genome, we successfully generated a chronic HBV infectious mouse model that presents the associated liver fibrosis observed following human infection. After AAV8/HBV1.2 vector administration, mice demonstrated effective HBV replication and transcription which resulted in HBV antigen expression and viremia over 6 months. Although no obvious acute inflammatory response was noted, these mice still developed chronic liver disease and hepatic fibrogenesis as demonstrated by increased ground glass-like hepatocytes, an increasing trend of collagen deposition and upregulated fibrosis markers, including type I collagen, type III collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP), and transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1). Taken together, AAV-mediated HBV gene delivery to the mouse liver, induced HBV persistent infection accompanied by liver fibrosis which can serve as a model for investigating the precise mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis following chronic HBV infection as well as for the potential development of novel therapeutics.

4015,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant worldwide health care problem. Nearly one-third of all patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are coinfected with HCV. Compared with HIV-monoinfected persons, coinfected individuals experience more rapid progression of fibrosis and higher incidence of cirrhosis and death as a result of liver disease. Treatment for HCV infection includes ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) or pegylated IFN, a combination treatment associated with anemia that may require RBV dose reduction or discontinuation. IFN-RBV-associated anemia is more profound among coinfected patients, who have a high prevalence of pretreatment anemia and may also be taking other medications causing anemia. Epoetin alfa administration to HCV-infected patients with IFN-RBV-related anemia can significantly increase hemoglobin levels and maintain significantly higher RBV doses compared with patients treated with RBV dose reduction alone. Higher RBV doses and adherence to HCV therapy have been associated with higher sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. Maintenance of RBV dose with epoetin alfa may improve adherence, thereby affecting SVR."

3598,0.002,2.0,"To investigate whether low CD4+ T-cell counts in healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected Ethiopians influence tuberculosis (TB) immunological memory, tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion and reactivity rates were investigated among adults with and without HIV infection in urban settings in Ethiopia. Reaction to the TST was analyzed with purified protein derivative by the Mantoux technique. A total of 1,286 individuals with TST results of > or = 5-mm (n = 851) and < or = 4-mm (n = 435) induration diameters were included. Individuals with < or = 4-mm induration sizes were followed up for 21.4 +/- 9.5 months (mean +/- standard deviation) to observe skin test conversion. The overall TST reactivity (> or = 5-mm induration diameter) was 66.2% (n = 851). Reactivity was significantly lower among HIV-positive persons (40.5%) than among HIV-negative persons (68.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the above persons, 32 incident TB patients were checked for their TST status 13.05 +/- 11.1 months before diagnosis and reactivity was found among 22 (68.7%) of them. Of the TST-negative persons with 0- to 4-mm indurations who were followed up for 3 years, the conversion rate to positivity was 17.9/100 person-years of observation (PYO) (14.4/100 PYO and 18.3/100 PYO in HIV-positive and -negative persons, respectively). Despite lower absolute CD4+ T-cell numbers in Ethiopians, higher TST conversion and reactivity rates show the presence of a higher rate of latent TB infection and/or transmission. The lower TST positivity rate before a diagnosis of TB disease showed the lower sensitivity of the test. This indicates the need for other sensitive and specific diagnostic and screening methods to detect TB infection, particularly among HIV-positive persons, so that they can be given prophylactic isoniazid therapy."
1583,0.002,2.0,"Neuronal damage in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the brain is thought to occur at least in part through NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitation initiated by soluble neurotoxins from HIV-infected brain macrophages. Furthermore, brain regions enriched in NMDAR-2A (NR2A) and NMDAR-2B (NR2B) subunits, such as the hippocampus, are particularly vulnerable. Using cultured rat hippocampal cells and HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HIV/MDM), we examined the role of NR2A and NR2B in HIV/MDM-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We used the primary HIV-1 strain Jago derived from the CSF of an individual with HIV-associated dementia and that robustly replicates in MDM. We found the following: (1) hippocampal neuronal susceptibility to HIV/MDM excitotoxins varies according to the developmental expression patterns of NR2A and NR2B; (2) NMDAR activation by HIV/MDM results in neuronal calpain activation, which results in neuronal death; and (3) selective antagonists of homomeric NR2B/NR2B- and heteromeric NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDARs, as well as an inhibitor of calpain activity, afford neuroprotection against HIV/MDM. These studies establish a clear link between macrophage HIV infection, neuronal NR2A and NR2B activation, and calpain-mediated hippocampal neuronal death. They further suggest a dominant role for NR2A and NR2B in determining neuronal susceptibility in HIV-infected brain. Antagonists of NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as inhibitors of calpain activation offer attractive neuroprotective approaches against HIV in both developing and mature brain."

The main limitation in the use of lamivudine is resistant mutation selection. Most of these mutations affect the YMDD motif of the HBV DNA polymerase. The resistance occurs through M550V or M550I aminoacid replacements. The M550V variation may be accompanied by L526M mutation, notably in HIV-HBV co-infected patients. The aim of this study was to investigate mutations associated with lamivudine resistance in a hemodialysis patient chronically co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, who was submitted to several antiretroviral treatments."

Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m; <30 kg/m, obesity was ≥30 kg/m. Patients' characteristics contemporary to BMI assessment were collected. Multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors associated with overweight/obesity.Eight hundred sixty-two patients, median age 51 years, 21.5 years of HIV infection follow-up, 585 (68%) male, 829 (96%) receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) for median 16.7 years, 768 (91%) HIV load <40 copies/mL, 618 (73%) CD4 ≥500 cells/mm; 266 (31%) HCV serology, 110 (13%) had detectable HCV-RNA. Overweight affected 191 (22%) patients and obesity 46 (5%). Overweight and obesity were associated with age, HIV follow-up duration, and HIV transmission risk group. Overweight was also associated with gender and HCV status. In patients with substance use data, overweight was associated with alcohol and nonsmoking status. Obesity was associated with nonsmoking and ex-smoker status. Overweight/obesity were not found associated with cART or immune cell counts.In HIV-infected people, aging, alcohol consumption, nonsmoking, and ex-smoker status, the absence of HCV coinfection and to have cleared HCV infection are associated with overweight and/or obesity. Clinicians should be aware of these trends and consider introducing weight management programs as part of routine HIV care."
7890,0.002,2.0,"Certain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates are able to productively infect nondividing cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. We have used a molecular genetic approach to construct two different HIV-1 integrase mutants that were studied in the context of an infectious, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 molecular clone. One mutant, HIV-1 delta D(35)E, containing a 37-residue deletion within the central, catalytic domain of integrase, was noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages. The HIV-1 delta D(35)E mutant, however, exhibited defects in the assembly and/or release of progeny virions in transient transfection assays, as well as defects in entry and/or viral DNA synthesis during the early stages of monocyte-derived macrophage infection. The second mutant, HIV-1D116N/8, containing a single Asp-to-Asn substitution at the invariant Asp-116 residue of integrase, was also noninfectious in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived macrophages but, in contrast to HIV-1 delta D(35)E, was indistinguishable from wild-type virus in reverse transcriptase production. PCR analysis indicated that HIV-1D116N/8 entered monocyte-derived macrophages efficiently and reverse transcribed its RNA but was unable to complete its replication cycle because of a presumed block to integration. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that integration is an obligate step in productive HIV-1 infection of activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and primary human macrophage cultures."
237,0.002,2.0,"Here, we found that a 6-mer peptide, Poly6, derived from the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which overlaps with a polymerase corresponding to a preS1 deletion reported to contribute to liver disease progression, can elicit an antiviral effect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 by inhibiting HIV-1 integrase (IN) activity of infected cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that the anti-HIV-1 effects of Poly6 occurred via the inhibition of integration, which resulted from the inhibition of acetylation of HIV-1 IN possibly by downregulation of p300 histone acetyltransferase. Our data suggest the potential therapeutic use of a 6-mer HBV-derived peptide, Poly6, as an anti-HIV-1 agent to suppress HIV-1 infection via inhibiting integrase activity."

Bone mineral density (BMD) and microarchitecture were characterized in 38 HIV-infected men on antiretroviral therapy (18 perinatally-infected, 20 adolescence-infected) and 20 uninfected men age 20 to 25 years by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT). Flow cytometry was utilized to measure CD4+/CD8+ activation (HLADR+CD38+) and senescence (CD28-CD57+) and to quantify circulating osteogenic precursor (COP) cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using antibodies to RUNX2 and osteocalcin (OCN). Telomere lengths were measured in sorted COP cells using qPCR. DXA-derived areal BMD Z-scores and HRpQCT-derived volumetric BMD (vBMD) measures were lower in HIV-infected than uninfected men. Proportion of activated and senescent CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in HIV-infected than uninfected men. The percentage of COP cells (mean ± SE) was lower in HIV-infected than uninfected (0.19% ± 0.02% versus 0.43% ± 0.06%; p < 0.0001) men, and also lower in perinatally-infected than adolescence-infected men (0.15% ± 0.02% versus 0.22% ± 0.03%; p < 0.04). A higher proportion of COP cells correlated with higher bone stiffness, a measure of bone strength, whereas a higher proportion of activated CD4+ T cells correlated with lower BMD and stiffness and lower proportion of COP cells. T cell activation with HIV-infection was associated with decreased numbers of osteogenic precursors as well as lower peak bone mass and bone strength. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."
2535,0.002,2.0,"Human papillomavirus is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. The natural history of oral HPV infection is unclear, and its risk factors have not been explored. Immunocompromised individuals, as exemplified by HIV patients, are at high risk for HPV-related diseases. The mean of this study is to determine the prevalence of HPV in the oral tract of HIV-1-positive male subjects and its association with risk factors. A total of 283 oral wash samples from HIV-1-positive men were tested. The oral fluid samples were used for DNA extraction and conventional PCR amplification; HPV genotyping was performed by hybridization. HPV genotyping revealed that nine samples (3.5%) were positive for HPV DNA; the major high-risk HPV types identified were 51 and 66. Worldwide studies have shown a variable prevalence of oral HPV. The diversity of genotypes and the high prevalence of multiple infections in HIV-infected subjects can be better explained by the effects of HIV-induced immunosuppression. The most important risk factors are unprotected sexual intercourse, but other factors for this infection have been described elsewhere including smoking, age and HIV-positive serostatus. In this study, smoking was the most important risk factor for acquiring oral HPV in HIV-1-infected subjects in Brazil."

HIV-1 gag, pol and nef sequences were generated from a historical repository of longitudinal specimens from 19 vertically infected infants. Evolutionary rate and selection were estimated for each gene and in CTL-restricted and non-restricted epitopes. Evolutionary rate was higher in nef and gag vs. pol, and lower in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag and nef. Selection pressure was stronger in infants with non-severe immunosuppression vs. severe immunosuppression across gag. The analysis also showed that infants with non-severe immunosuppression had stronger selection in CTL-restricted vs. non-restricted epitopes in gag and nef. Evidence of stronger CTL selection was absent in infants with severe immunosuppression. These data indicate that infant CTLs can exert selection pressure on gag and nef epitopes in early infection and that stronger selection across CTL epitopes is associated with favourable clinical outcomes. These results have implications for the development of paediatric HIV-1 vaccines."
2771,0.002,2.0,"Because vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from mother to infant occurs in only 15%-35% of possible opportunities, natural immune defenses of the mother, fetus, or neonate may be protective against infection. The relation between antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibodies and HIV-1 infection was explored in 78 neonates born to HIV-infected women. More than 90% of sera had measurable ADCC titers against HIV-1IIIB. Infant titers were closely correlated with maternal titers but were independent of total IgG and total antibody reactive to the same strain in whole virus ELISA. At birth, mean ADCC antibody levels of infants or their mothers were the same for infants who were infected and those who ultimately seroreverted and remained healthy. ADCC antibody titers against HIV-1SF2 were weakly correlated with anti-HIV-1IIIB titers and did not predict protection from HIV-1 infection. High levels of anti-HIV-1 ADCC antibody at birth are not protective against vertical transmission of HIV-1."
3850,0.002,2.0,"The nature and intensity of AIDS stigma are shaped by the social construction of the epidemic in different locales. Stigma therefore needs to be discussed in its cultural context. This clinic-based study aims at understanding stigma among 203 HIV positive individuals from Chennai, South India. The study throws light on the impact of stigma on the quality of life among these individuals. It also discusses the gender implications of stigma. This study brings out the findings that actual stigma experienced among those infected with HIV is much less (26%) as compared to the fear of being stigmatized or perceived stigma (97%). Internalizing of stigma was found to have a highly significant negative correlation with quality of life in the psychological domain and a significant negative correlation in the environmental domain. However individuals who did experience actual stigma seemed more determined to live and experience an above moderate quality of life. The implication of this study encourages HIV infected individuals to rise above stigma, avoid internalizing their stigmatized feelings and work toward a better quality of life. Health providers need to address these issues in their care for HIV infected individuals."
6977,0.002,2.0,"Palliative care for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) includes components of pain and symptom management, advance care planning, prioritization of life goals, and the support of individuals and families throughout the entire continuum of the disease. There are numerous social stressors such as stigma, infected family members and caregivers, loss of housing and independent living, and the increasing influence of substance use in all communities. Because many barriers prevent those with advanced disease from getting comprehensive pain and symptom management as well as option planning, it is important for all HIV care providers to improve their knowledge, sensitivity, and competence regarding this aspect of care. This article provides an overview of critical issues in palliative care and information on how best to improve HIV primary care."
5923,0.002,2.0,"The widespread use of antiretroviral therapy and remarkable success in the treatment of paediatric HIV infection has changed the face of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic in children from a fatal disease to that of a chronic illness. Many children living with HIV are surviving into adolescence. This sub-population of people living with HIV is emerging as a public health challenge and burden in terms of healthcare management and service utilization than previously anticipated. This article provides an overview of the socio-developmental challenges facing adolescents living with HIV especially in a resource-limited setting like Nigeria. These include concerns about their healthy sexuality, safer sex and transition to adulthood, disclosure of their status and potential stigma, challenges faced with daily living, access and adherence to treatment, access to care and support, and clinic transition. Other issues include reality of death and implications for fertility intentions, mental health concerns and neurocognitive development. Coping strategies and needed support for adolescents living with HIV are also discussed, and the implications for policy formulation and programme design and implementation in Nigeria are highlighted."
5572,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection disrupts the intestinal immune system, leading to microbial translocation and systemic immune activation. We investigated the impact of HIV-1 infection on the intestinal microbiome and its association with mucosal T-cell and dendritic cell (DC) frequency and activation, as well as with levels of systemic T-cell activation, inflammation, and microbial translocation. Bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing was performed on colon biopsies and fecal samples from subjects with chronic, untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected control subjects. Colon biopsies of HIV-1-infected subjects had increased abundances of Proteobacteria and decreased abundances of Firmicutes compared with uninfected donors. Furthermore at the genus level, a significant increase in Prevotella and decrease in Bacteroides was observed in HIV-1-infected subjects, indicating a disruption in the Bacteroidetes bacterial community structure. This HIV-1-associated increase in Prevotella abundance was associated with increased numbers of activated colonic T cells and myeloid DCs. Principal coordinates analysis demonstrated an HIV-1-related change in the microbiome that was associated with increased mucosal cellular immune activation, microbial translocation, and blood T-cell activation. These observations suggest that an important relationship exists between altered mucosal bacterial communities and intestinal inflammation during chronic HIV-1 infection. "
6383,0.002,2.0,"A pilot study was carried out in a group of six HIV-infected non-adherent men testing the effects of a behavioural medication management intervention on adherence with antiretroviral drugs. The study was prospective, using a one-group repeated-measures design. Adherence was measured using two self-reports. The intervention was a behaviourally-based programme that lasted for three months and included individualized education about antiretroviral medication and their side effects; positive reinforcement and encouragement; individualized counselling weekly; follow-up calls; and lifestyle assessment and the identification of adherence barriers. Assessments were carried out at recruitment, immediately after the initiation of the intervention, one month, three months and six months later. Results suggested that the intervention enhanced adherence rates from a mean percentage of 80.27 at baseline to a mean of 97.5% at the end of follow-up (six months time point). Similar improvement was observed in the scores of the scale measuring adherence difficulties. Further, CD4+ counts also slightly improved. Interviews with four of the participants at the end of the study highlighted the problems experienced by patients in taking their medication and supported the usefulness of the intervention. Because of the complexity of the factors behind adherence, it is important that patients are supported with individualized medication management programmes."
4416,0.002,2.0,"In HIV-1 infection, plasma viral load (VL) has dual implications for pathogenesis and public health. Based on well-known patterns of HIV-1 evolution and immune escape, we hypothesized that VL is an evolving quantitative trait that depends heavily on duration of infection (DOI), demographic features, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and viral characteristics. Prospective data from 421 African seroconverters with at least four eligible visits did show relatively steady VL beyond 3 months of untreated infection, but host and viral factors independently associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal VL often varied by analytical approaches and sliding time windows. Specifically, the effects of age, HLA-B(⁎)53 and infecting HIV-1 subtypes (A1, C and others) on VL were either sporadic or highly sensitive to time windows. These observations were strengthened by the addition of 111 seroconverters with 2-3 eligible VL results, suggesting that DOI should be a critical parameter in epidemiological and clinical studies. "

Drugs with a low level of potential toxicity, especially those that are not nucleoside analogues, should be evaluated in healthy individuals who are not infected with HIV before trials in HIV-infected patients commence. The guideline also discusses possible clinical and laboratory end points for efficacy and emphasizes the need for careful validation of all laboratory end points used. The approach of the guideline is deliberately general: more specific recommendations would soon become outdated in this field, which is characterized by extremely rapid developments."
5110,0.002,2.0,"Liver-related mortality is increased in the setting of HIV-hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection. However, interactions between HIV and HBV to explain this observation have not been described. We hypothesized that HIV infection of hepatocytes directly affects the life cycle of HBV. We infected human hepatic cell lines expressing HBV (Hep3B and AD38 cells) or not expressing HBV (Huh7, HepG2, and AD43 cells) with laboratory strains of HIV (NL4-3 and AD8), as well as a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-pseudotyped HIV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Following HIV infection with NL4-3 or AD8 in hepatic cell lines, we observed a significant increase in HIV reverse transcriptase activity which was infectious. Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4. High-level infection of AD38 cells (50%) was achieved using VSV-pseudotyped HIV. Coinfection of the AD38 cell line with HIV did not alter the HBV DNA amount or species as determined by Southern blotting or nucleic acid signal amplification. However, coinfection with HIV was associated with a significant increase in intracellular HBsAg when measured by Western blotting, quantitative HBsAg, and fluorescence microscopy. We conclude that HIV infection of HBV-infected hepatic cell lines significantly increased intracellular HBsAg but not HBV DNA synthesis and that increased intrahepatic HBsAg secondary to direct infection by HIV may contribute to accelerated liver disease in HIV-HBV-coinfected individuals."
1159,0.002,2.0,"Rapid detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can result in improved patient care and/or faster implementation of public health preventive measures. A new rapid test, Determine (Abbott, Abbott Park, Ill.), detects HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 antibodies within 15 min by using 50 microl of serum or plasma. No specialized equipment or ancillary supplies are required, and results are read visually. A positive result is noted by the appearance of a red line. An operational control (red line) indicates proper test performance. We evaluated the Determine rapid HIV detection test with a group of well-characterized serum samples (CD4 counts and viral loads were known) and serum samples from HIV-positive individuals at field sites in Honduras and the Dominican Republic. In the field evaluations, the results obtained by the Determine assay were compared to those obtained by local in-country HIV screening procedures. We evaluated serum from 100 HIV-positive patients and 66 HIV-negative patients. All samples gave the expected results. In a companion study, 42 HIV-positive samples from a Miami, Fla., serum bank were tested by the Determine assay. The samples had been characterized in terms of CD4 counts and viral loads. Fifteen patients had CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3), while 27 patients had CD4 counts >200 cells/mm(3). Viral loads ranged from 630 to 873,746 log(10) copies/ml. All samples from the Miami serum bank were positive by the Determine test. Combined results from the multicenter studies indicated that the correct results were obtained by the Determine assay for 100% (142 of 142) of the HIV-positive serum samples and 100% (66 of 66) of the HIV-negative serum samples. The Determine test was simple to perform and the results were easy to interpret. The Determine test provides a valuable new method for the rapid identification of HIV-positive individuals, especially in developing countries with limited laboratory infrastructures."
231,0.002,2.0,"Hepatologists are frequently asked to evaluate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with abnormal liver enzymes and to assess the causal role of medications, such as antiretroviral drugs. Recently, the use of HIV-1 specific non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), including nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), has been associated with severe hepatic injury. We prospectively studied the incidence of severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4 change in alanine or aspartate transaminase levels) among 568 patients receiving NNRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy, including 312 and 256 patients prescribed EFV and NVP, respectively. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were detected in 43% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. Severe hepatotoxicity was observed in 15.6% of patients prescribed NVP and 8.0% of those prescribed EFV, but only 32% of NVP and 50% of EFV-associated episodes were detected during the first 12-weeks of therapy. The risk was significantly greater among persons with chronic viral hepatitis (69% of cases) and those prescribed concurrent protease inhibitors (PIs) (82% of cases). Nonetheless, 84% of patients with chronic HCV or HBV did not experience severe hepatotoxicity. Severe hepatotoxicity occurs throughout the course of NNRTI therapy and is more common among patients prescribed nevirapine, those coinfected with HCV or HBV, and those coadministered protease inhibitors."
7288,0.002,2.0,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) can increase numbers of absolute CD4 cells in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who are receiving antiretroviral therapy. Twenty-five subjects with > 400/mm3 absolute CD4 cells received zidovudine and low-dose intravenous or subcutaneous IL-2 (< or = 10(6) U/m2). Absolute CD4 cells increased significantly during IL-2 treatment, and 56% of the subjects achieved a maximal increase of > or = 500 cells/mm3. A dose-response relationship favored increasing IL-2 doses, and subcutaneous delivery offered greater increases than intravenous administration. Fifteen subjects had persistent increases of > or = 100 cells/mm3 6 weeks after IL-2 was discontinued. No changes occurred in delayed-type hypersensitivity or helper T cell responses to recall antigens. Cell-mediated cytotoxicities increased against Daudi cells. IL-2 was well tolerated and only 1 subject required dose reduction. Relatively low-dose IL-2 delivered by subcutaneous or intravenous routes may provide an important complement to antiretroviral therapy to increase absolute CD4 cells with the potential for less toxicity than with higher IL-2 doses."
8356,0.002,2.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased cardiovascular risk. Although initially this increased risk was attributed to metabolic alterations associated with antiretroviral treatment, in recent years, the attention has been focused on the HIV disease itself. Inflammation, immune system activation, and endothelial dysfunction facilitated by HIV infection have been identified as key factors in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In this review, we describe the epidemiology and pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV infection and summarize the latest knowledge on the relationship between traditional and novel inflammatory, immune activation, and endothelial dysfunction biomarkers on the cardiovascular risk associated with HIV infection.

3092,0.002,2.0,"Statin use decreases the risk of decompensation and mortality in patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Whether this beneficial effect can be extended to cirrhosis in the general population or cirrhosis due to other causes, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or alcohol, remains unknown. Statin use also decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether the effect can be observed in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statin use on rates of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in HBV-, HCV-, and alcohol-related cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis were identified from a representative cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries from 2000 to 2013. Statin users, defined as having a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) ≥28, were selected and served as the case cohort. Statin nonusers (<28 cDDD) were matched through propensity scores. The association between statin use and risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC were estimated. A total of 1350 patients with cirrhosis were enrolled. Among patients with cirrhosis, statin use decreased the risk of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in a dose-dependent manner (P for trend <0.0001, <0.0001, and 0.009, respectively). Regression analysis revealed a lower risk of decompensation among statin users with cirrhosis due to chronic HBV (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.62) or HCV infection (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93). The lowered risk of decompensation was of borderline significance among statin users with alcohol-related cirrhosis (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.45-1.07)."
4300,0.002,2.0,"Our search of the literature revealed no detailed case reports about drug fever induced by piperacillin/tazobactam in a patient with HIV infection although there were a few case reports about drug fever due to piperacillin/tazobactam with other comorbidities. A 63-year-old male patient with HIV positive was admitted for acute cholecystitis. He was started on piperacillin/tazobactam. For the next 8 days, he had intermittent fever up to 103°F (39.4°C) with relative bradycardia although he showed clinical improvement. There was no laboratory or imaging findings suggestive of another infectious source and drug fever was suspected. The antibiotics were stopped and after 48 hours no fever was observed until the day of discharge. Piperacillin/tazobactam can induce fever in patients with cystic fibrosis and in patients with other conditions. Drug fever may be more prevalent in patients with HIV infection. It has no characteristic pattern and may not be associated with eosinophilia. "
4964,0.002,2.0,"The Tat-responsive region (TAR) element is a critical RNA regulatory element in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat, which is required for activation of gene expression by the transactivator protein Tat. Recently, we demonstrated by gel-retardation analysis that RNA polymerase II binds to TAR RNA and that Tat prevents this binding even when Tat does not bind to TAR RNA. These results suggested that direct interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II may prevent RNA polymerase II pausing and lead to Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation. To test this possibility, we performed protein interaction studies with RNA polymerase II and both the HIV-1 and the closely related HIV-2 Tat protein. These studies indicated that both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins could specifically interact with RNA polymerase II. Mutagenesis of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat demonstrated that the basic domains of both the HIV-1 and HIV-2 Tat proteins were required for this interaction. Furthermore, ""far Western"" analysis suggested that the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II was the site for interaction with Tat. The interactions between Tat and RNA polymerase II were of similar magnitude to those detected between RNA polymerase II and the cellular transcription factor RAP30, which stably associates with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. These studies are consistent with the model that RNA polymerase II is a cellular target for Tat resulting in Tat-mediated increases in transcriptional elongation from the HIV long terminal repeat."
2472,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of human T-cell leukaemia virus-I and -II infection was studied in a cohort of 346 intravenous and nonintravenous drug users in Amsterdam. Three participants (0.86%) had antibodies to HTLV-I by two commercially available HTLV-I enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Infection in these three subjects was confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In the immunoblot study, only two of the three subjects were considered positive, since the serum of the third subject had antibodies to p24 only. By means of the polymerase chain reaction two participants (male intravenous drug users infected with human immunodeficiency virus; HIV) appeared to be infected with HTLV-I and one subject (a male nonintravenous drug user from Surinam) with HTLV-II. It is concluded that HTLV-I and HTLV-II circulate sporadically among drug users in Amsterdam and that risky injecting behaviour, which led to an HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users, has not led so far to an appreciable transmission of the other retroviruses among this group."
2623,0.002,2.0,"Reports of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in seronegative individuals prompted the authors to investigate subjects who are at very high risk of acquisition of HIV in San Francisco. Nine HIV seronegative subjects were evaluated extensively, eight of whom were drawn from a well-characterized cohort of seropositive and seronegative homosexual men who have been followed prospectively since 1983-1984. These men have calculated probabilities of infection based on a fitted model of between 0.22 and 0.94. One additional subject is an intravenous drug user who has shared needles with HIV-infected individuals extensively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes were separately cultured from each subject and evidence of HIV infection was sought by a reverse transcriptase assay, enzyme immunoassay, and immunocytofluorographic analysis for HIV antigens, in situ hybridization, RNA slot blot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction amplification of HIV cDNA. Uncultured monocytes and lymphocytes from each donor were also examined by these techniques. Evidence of HIV infection was not found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these high risk individuals."
9492,0.002,2.0,"In 32 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women, routine gynecologic examination was performed with colposcopy and Papanicolaou smear; cervical swabs were collected for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening and typing; and immune status was assessed by CD4 T-cell count. Dot blot analysis was specifically chosen for HPV DNA screening to detect only relatively substantial HPV DNA infections. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was used for precise DNA typing of dot blot-positive samples. The HPV data were assessed for immune status; a subject with a CD4 T-cell count below 200/microL was considered functionally immunosuppressed. The frequency of dot blot positivity was fivefold higher among immunocompromised (nine of ten) than relatively immunocompetent (four of 22) HIV-infected women. Moreover, four immunosuppressed women, compared with no immunocompetent subjects, had evidence of HPV DNA without signs of HPV-associated lesions by cytology or histology (ie, latent HPV infection). Furthermore, four of nine of the immunocompromised, compared with four of 21 immunocompetent, subjects had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. These frequencies are high compared with those reported in the general population. Finally, HPV 18 was detected in five of the ten women with CD4 T-cell counts below 200/microL and in only one of the 22 with CD4 T-cell counts above that level. These results suggest that the normal immune system suppresses latent and clinical HPV cervical infections and that the efficiency of suppression may be HPV type-specific. Furthermore, impaired immune status, as reflected by CD4 T-cell count, is an important factor increasing the severity of HPV-induced cervical infections in this population."

The aim of this study was to correlate the onset of the cerebral ischemic attack accompanied by mixed cryoglobulinemia, with the chronic hepatitis C virus infection. These studies were carried out in 12 patients with serologic/virusologic confirmed chronic HCV infection associated with ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke occurred in equal proportion in women and men. The patients did not know of HCV infection diagnosis at that moment. All patients had type II mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, hypergammaglobulinemia with polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM, blood hyperviscosity, high level of cryocrit, positive rheumatoid factor, normal levels of serum transaminases, negative serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag), negative anti HBc antibodies, positive HCV antibodies, positive serum RNA HCV, decreased serum C3 and C4 levels, antinuclear antibodies-false positive. Immunological tests for autoantibodies, namely, anti-Sm antibody, anti-RNP antibody, anti-SS-A and -B antibodies, and anti-Scl antibody were not detectable due to high level serum cryoglobulin. Cryoglobulin was washed several times with an isotonic chloride solution for purification, then subject to immunological analyses. The purified cryoglobulin contained monoclonal IgM-kappa, polyclonal IgG. Cryoglobulinemia is a risk factor for ischemic stroke, as it causes arterial thrombosis."
886,0.002,2.0,"The possession of some HLA class I molecules is associated with delayed progression to AIDS. The mechanism behind this beneficial effect is unclear. We tested the idea that cytotoxic T-cell responses restricted by advantageous HLA class I molecules impose stronger selection pressures than those restricted by other HLA class I alleles. As a measure of the selection pressure imposed by HLA class I alleles, we determined the extent of HLA class I-associated epitope variation in a cohort of European human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals (n=84). We validated our findings in a second, distinct cohort of African patients (n=516). We found that key HIV epitopes restricted by advantageous HLA molecules (B27, B57, and B51 in European patients and B5703, B5801, and B8101 in African patients) were more frequently mutated in individuals bearing the restricting HLA than in those who lacked the restricting HLA class I molecule. HLA alleles associated with clinical benefit restricted certain epitopes for which the consensus peptides were frequently recognized by the immune response despite the circulating virus's being highly polymorphic. We found a significant inverse correlation between the HLA-associated hazard of disease progression and the mean HLA-associated prevalence of mutations within epitopes (P=0.028; R2=0.34). We conclude that beneficial HLA class I alleles impose strong selection at key epitopes. This is revealed by the frequent association between effective T-cell responses and circulating viral escape mutants and the rarity of these variants in patients who lack these favorable HLA class I molecules, suggesting a significant pressure to revert."
9214,0.002,2.0,"The development of an effective maternal HIV-1 vaccine that could synergize with antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eliminate pediatric HIV-1 infection will require the characterization of maternal immune responses capable of blocking transmission of autologous HIV to the infant. We previously determined that maternal plasma antibody binding to linear epitopes within the variable loop 3 (V3) region of HIV envelope (Env) and neutralizing responses against easy-to-neutralize tier 1 viruses were associated with reduced risk of peripartum HIV infection in the historic U.S. Woman and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) cohort. Here, we defined the fine specificity and function of the potentially protective maternal V3-specific IgG antibodies associated with reduced peripartum HIV transmission risk in this cohort. The V3-specific IgG binding that predicted low risk of mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) was dependent on the C-terminal flank of the V3 crown and particularly on amino acid position 317, a residue that has also been associated with breakthrough transmission in the RV144 vaccine trial. Remarkably, the fine specificity of potentially protective maternal plasma V3-specific tier 1 virus-neutralizing responses was dependent on the same region in the V3 loop. Our findings suggest that MTCT risk is associated with neutralizing maternal IgG that targets amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of the V3 loop crown, suggesting the importance of the region in immunogen design for maternal vaccines to prevent MTCT."
6316,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is less pathogenic than HIV type 1 (HIV-1), but the mechanisms underlying this difference have not been defined. We developed an internally controlled quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to measure HIV-2 viral load and determined levels of plasma virus in a cohort of registered commercial sex workers in Dakar, Senegal. The assay has a lower limit of detection of 100 copies/mL and is linear over 4 logs. HIV-2 viral RNA was detectable in 56% of all samples tested; the median load was 141 copies/mL. Levels of viral RNA in the plasma were inversely related to CD4+ cell counts. HIV-2 and HIV-1 viral loads were compared among the seroincident women in the cohort; the median viral load was 30x lower in the HIV-2-infected women (P<.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test), irrespective of the length of time infected. This suggests that plasma viremia is linked to the differences in the pathogenicity of the 2 viruses."
5200,0.002,2.0,"A number of linear and conformation-dependent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been mapped to the first and second variable (V1 and V2) domains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120. The majority of these MAbs are as effective at neutralizing HIV-1 infectivity as MAbs to the V3 domain and the CD4 binding site. The linear MAbs bind to amino acid residues 162 to 171, and changes at residues 183/184 (PI/SG) and 191/192/193 (YSL/GSS) within the V2 domain abrogate the binding of the two conformation-dependent MAbs, 11/68b and CRA-4, respectively. Surprisingly, a change at residue 435 (Y/H or Y/S), in a region of gp120 near the CD4 binding site (M. Kowalski, J. Potz, L. Basiripour, T. Dorfman, W. C. Goh, E. Terwilliger, A. Dayton, C. Rosen, W. Haseltine, and J. Sodroski, Science 237:1351-1355, 1987; L. A. Lasky, G. M. Nakamura, D. H. Smith, C. Fennie, C. Shimasaki, E. Patzer, P. Berman, T. Gregory, and D.

Virol. 64:5701-5707, 1990), abrogated gp120 recognition by both of the conformation-dependent MAbs. However, both MAbs 11/68b and CRA-4 were able to bind to HIV-1 V1V2 chimeric fusion proteins expressing the V1V2 domains in the absence of C4, suggesting that residues in C4 are not components of the epitopes but that amino acid changes in C4 may affect the structure of the V1V2 domains. This is consistent with the ability of soluble CD4 to block 11/68b and CRA-4 binding to both native cell surface-expressed gp120 and recombinant gp120 and suggests that the binding of the neutralizing MAbs to the virus occurs prior to receptor interaction. Since the reciprocal inhibition, i.e., antibody inhibition of CD4-gp120 binding, was not observed, the mechanism of neutralization is probably not a blockade of virus-receptor interaction. Finally, we demonstrate that linear sequences from the V2 region are immunogenic in HIV-1-infected individuals, suggesting that the primary neutralizing response may be directed to both V2 and V3 epitopes."
8812,0.002,2.0,"We evaluated the performance of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen/antibody combination test [Murex HCV Antigen/Antibody Combination Test (Murex Ag/Ab test)] by comparing it with the current third-generation HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay (anti-HCV). A total of 403 serum samples were consecutively collected from four patient groups: healthy controls (n=100); HCV-infected patients (HCV group, n=102); Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV-infected patients (HIV/HCV group, n=100); and patients with uremia (uremia group, n=101). Performances were evaluated for the Murex Ag/Ab, anti-HCV, and HCV RNA in the HIV/HCV and uremia patient groups. In the HCV group, all 102 samples showed concordant positive and negative results for anti-HCV, Murex Ag/Ab, and HCV RNA tests. In the HIV/HCV group, all 100 samples were positive for both anti-HCV and Murex Ag/Ab tests, whereas 88 patients (88%) were HCV RNA positive. In the uremia group, 14 (69.0%) of the 23 anti-HCV-positive patients were HCV RNA positive, whereas 14 (77.8%) of the 18 Murex Ag/Ab-positive patients were HCV RNA positive. None of anti-HCV-negative or Murex Ag/Ab-negative patients were HCV RNA positive. Based on the HCV RNA assay, the sensitivities for both anti-HCV and Murex Ag/Ab assays were 100%, whereas the specificities of these two assays were 89.7% and 95.4%, respectively. With good sensitivity and specificity, the Murex Ag/Ab assay could be a useful alternative diagnostic tool, especially in immunocompromised populations, such as patients with uremia or those infected with HIV."
2318,0.002,2.0,"Occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (OBI) is defined as the presence of HBV DNA in the liver (with or without detectable HBV DNA in serum) for individuals testing HBV surface antigen negative. Until recently, the clinical effect of OBI was unclear on the progression of liver disease; on the development of hepatocellular carcinoma; and on the risk for reactivation or transmission of HBV infection. Several studies suggest a high prevalence of OBI among patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease, but its role in the progression to cirrhosis remains unclear. Although OBI has been well documented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, especially among those coinfected with hepatitis C virus, further studies are needed to determine its current clinical impact in HIV setting."
5259,0.002,2.0,"Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains prevalent in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Memory function is commonly affected. There is a need for a rapid, but sensitive screening tool. This study compares the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and a computerised battery cognitive assessment to establish if the questionnaire has potential as a rapid screening tool for HIV-associated NCI. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with an undetectable HIV viral load on stable HAART were eligible to participate. Asymptomatic NCI (aNCI) was defined as a performance score more than 1SD below the normative mean in at least two domains of the computerised test. Memory impairment (MI) was defined as a t-score more than 1 SD below the normative mean using the PRMQ. Forty-five subjects participated. The mean age was 48 years (SD 11), the mean CD4 count was 546 cells/mul (SD 271), and 84% were male. Of subjects, 14/45 (24%) had NCI and 15/45 (33%) had MI. Two subjects had both types of impairment. No significant association was found between the presence of aNCI and MI (p = 0.229, r = 0.18, 95% CI -1.2, 0.23). aNCI was statistically significantly associated with younger age (p = 0.38, r = 0.31, 95% CI -0.02, 0.001). MI was statistically significantly associated with the set-shifting cognitive domain of the computerized battery (p = 0.04, r = 0.326) and time elapsed since HIV diagnosis (p = 0.035, r = 0.316). High rates of asymptomatic NCI were observed in this cohort, especially in younger individuals. The memory questionnaire did not reliably identify HIV-associated NCI other than executive function deficits and based on our data should therefore not be used as a rapid screening tool for this purpose."

2546,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a worldwide public health concern. The circulation of strains carrying mutations in the viral proteins implies both clinical and therapeutics challenges. HBV complete genomes (HBV-CGs) were reported from injecting drug users and HBV chronically infected patients from Argentina-including Amerindians-although no studies were conducted in blood donors. Here, we described HBV-CG sequences from the latter population. Some of the HBV sequences classified as B2 and C2 subgenotypes clustering together with Asian isolates, while others, such as D3, F1b, and F4, were homologous to European and Latin America sequences. New substitutions for all analyzed open reading frames and changes in the HBsAg hydrophobicity profiles were detected. Several HBV-CG subgenotypes are described for the first time in this population. Mutations observed in X, PreS, and P proteins have been associated with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and/or natural resistance to nucleos(t)ide antiviral treatment. It deserves to be highlighted that these substitutions were detected in a population without epidemiological risk factors for viral infection, and most importantly, without any previous antiviral treatment (natural resistance). Regarding the remaining mutations, further research is warranted in order to determine their clinical and therapeutics relevance."
9795,0.002,2.0,"Current treatment options for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are not curative as they are not effective in eliminating covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). cccDNA is a stable template for HBV transcription in the nucleus of hepatocytes and is thought to be one of the main factors responsible for HBV persistence. Recently, activation of the lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) has been shown to trigger degradation of cccDNA through induction of cytidine deaminases of the APOBEC3 family in HBV cell culture model systems. To assess the presence and relevance of such mechanisms in the liver of chronically HBV-infected patients, we compared intrahepatic cccDNA levels with the expression levels of lymphotoxins and some of their target genes (eg APOBEC deaminases) in liver biopsy tissue. Our results confirm elevated gene expression levels of components of the lymphotoxin pathway including lymphotoxin alpha (LTα), lymphotoxin beta (LTβ), APOBEC3B (A3B) and APOBEC3G (A3G) in the chronically HBV-infected liver compared to uninfected liver. Furthermore, expression levels of the genes of the APOBEC deaminase family were correlated with those of LTα and LTβ gene expression, consistent with lymphotoxin-mediated upregulation of APOBEC gene expression. However, intrahepatic cccDNA and HBV replication levels were not correlated with LTα, LTβ and APOBEC gene expression. In conclusion, these results suggest that although the lymphotoxin pathway is activated in the chronically HBV-infected liver, it has no major impact on HBV cccDNA metabolism in chronic HBV infection."
4261,0.002,2.0,"The cytosine analog 2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, several liver transplant patients who were undergoing treatment with 3TC for HBV infection experienced a breakthrough of virus while on 3TC. The predominant virus found in these patients' sera contained either a valine or isoleucine for the methionine in the highly conserved YMDD nucleotide binding site in the HBV polymerase. To determine the biological relevance of the Met-to-Val substitution, we mutated a plasmid that contained a cDNA copy of the HBV pregenomic RNA such that when virus replication occurred during transient transfection of HepG2 cells, an M539V polymerase variant was produced. We found that in transiently transfected cells, this variant was approximately 330-fold less sensitive to the antiviral effects of 3TC and produced 7-fold less viral DNA than the wild type."
4732,0.002,2.0,"Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV are very frequent. Although HBV is a DNA virus, it replicates via reverse transcription like HIV. Structural similarities between the enzymatic pocket of the HBV DNA polymerase and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase are the basis that certain drugs inhibit both enzymes and thus the replication of both viruses. HBV components increase the pathogenic action of HIV and vice versa directly by certain proteins like HBsAg in the case of HBV and HIV-encoded Tat and Vpr and by disturbing the cytokine balance in affected cells. Antiretroviral therapy is highly beneficial for HIV/HBV-coinfected patients, but carries the risk of drug-induced resistance development and hepatotoxicity. Even with restoration of the immune capacity, signs of hepatic inflammation may develop even after 10 years of treatment."
4579,0.002,2.0,"The development and application of nucleoside (and nucleotide) analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection will transform the management of this condition. For instance, treatment with lamivudine effects a dramatic and measurable reduction of serum virus titre. This is associated with biochemical and histological improvements. Unfortunately, for the majority, replication resumes when treatment is withdrawn. Prolonged lamividine treatment may be associated with the emergence of drug-resistant species with specific polymerase mutations. Compared with the observed rate for the development of drug resistance observed during monotherapy of HIV infection, resistance is slow to emerge during treatment of hepatitis B. The rate of emergence might be dependent on the rate of infected hepatocyte turnover, which is extremely variable in chronic HBV infection (and significantly slower than infected lymphocyte turnover during HIV infection). Preliminary data suggest that pretreatment serum virus titre may be an important predictor of the development of drug resistance, an observation consistent with preexistance of the resistant virus in the hepatitis B virus quasispecies. Akin to developments in antiviral treatment of HIV infection, further progress in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B will depend on the development of drugs for use in combination therapy."
8810,0.002,2.0,"Mutations associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) resistance to lamivudine have not been extensively addressed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HBV coinfection. We have studied the HBV polymerase sequences from nine coinfected patients who experienced HBV recurrence while under lamivudine treatment. In seven of these nine patients, Met(550), belonging to the highly conserved YMDD motif, was mutated to Val and was associated with a substitution of Met for Leu(526) in each case. In the two remaining patients, we found a Met(550)-to-Ile change that was associated in only one case with a Leu(526)-to-Met mutation. No mutation was observed in three control patients not receiving lamivudine. This study demonstrates the emergence of particular genetic profiles in HBV-HIV-coinfected patients experiencing a loss of control of HBV infection despite high doses of lamivudine."

2336,0.002,2.0,"Recently, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutations have been reported to be related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This cross-sectional case-control study examined the relationship between HCC and mutations in the enhancer II/core promoter and precore regions of HBV by comparing 135 Korean HCC patients infected with HBV genotype C2 (HBV/C2; HCC group) with 135 age-, sex-, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status-matched patients without HCC (non- HCC group). Age and sex were also matched between HBeAg-positive and -negative patients. The prevalence of T1653, A1689, V1753, T1762/A1764, T1846, A1850, C1858, and A1896 mutations was evaluated in this population. The prevalence of the T1653 mutation in the box alpha region, the T1689 [corrected] mutation in between the box alpha and beta regions, and the T1762/A1764 mutations in the basal core promoter region was significantly higher in the HCC group compared to the non-HCC group (8.9% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.017; 19.3% vs. 4.4%, P < 0.001; and 60.7% vs. 22.2%; P < 0.001). Among HBeAg-negative patients, the frequency of the T1653 mutation was higher in the HCC group. Regardless of HBeAg status, the prevalence of the T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was higher in the HCC group than in the non-HCC group. However, no association was observed between mutations in the precore region and HCC. Upon multivariate analysis, the presence of the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and T1762/A1764 mutations was an independent predictive factor for HCC. The addition of the T1653 or T1689 [corrected] mutation to T1762/A1764 increased the risk of HCC. In conclusion, the T1653, T1689, [corrected] and/or T1762/A1764 mutations were associated with the development of HCC in Korean patients infected with HBV/C2."
2759,0.002,2.0,"This study assessed the association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a highly HBV-endemic area. The prevalence of either HBV or HCV infection in 235 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was compared with that of an age- and sex-matched hospital control group of 235 patients. The prevalence of HBV infection was higher in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (15.5%) than control (8.1%), but the prevalence of HCV infection in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (2.1%) and control group (3%) was similar. HBV prevalence increased significantly with age in the B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The presence of HBV proteins and DNA in lymphoma tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients was also investigated using immunohistochemistry and PCR. HBV DNA was frequently detected in PBMCs from HBV-infected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, but HBV antigens were not. Therefore, HBV infection, but not HCV infection, was associated with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Korea, suggesting a possible role for HBV in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Research priorities include improved and point-of-care TB diagnostics; TB treatment and prevention during HIV infection, drug-resistant TB, and childhood TB; and optimization of TB and HIV program integration. With new TB diagnostics and drugs reaching approval, research must focus on effectively deploying these advancements. Research must include evaluations of individual, household, health care, and community approaches.

8650,0.002,2.0,"Characterization of virus-specific immune responses to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is important to understanding the early virus-host interactions that may determine the course of virus infection and disease. Using a comprehensive panel of serological assays, we have previously demonstrated a complex and lengthy maturation of virus-specific antibody responses elicited by attenuated strains of SIV that was closely associated with the development of protective immunity. In the present study, we expand these analyses to address several questions regarding the nature of the virus-specific antibody responses to pathogenic SIV, SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV), and HIV-1 infections. The results demonstrate for the first time a common theme of antibody maturation to SIV, SHIV, and HIV-1 infections that is characterized by ongoing changes in antibody titer, conformational dependence, and antibody avidity during the first 6 to 10 months following virus infection. We demonstrate that this gradual evolution of virus-specific antibody responses is independent of the levels of virus replication and the pathogenicity of the infection viral strain. While the serological assays used in these studies were useful in discriminating between protective and nonprotective antibody responses during evaluation of vaccine efficacy with attenuated SIV, these same assays do not distinguish the clinical outcome of infection in pathogenic SIV, SHIV, or HIV-1 infections. These results likely reflect differences in the immune mechanisms involved in mediating protection from virus challenge compared to those that control an established viral infection, and they suggest that additional characteristics of both humoral and cellular responses evolve during this early immune maturation."
7829,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continues to grow at an alarming rate, with a further 5 million new infections in 2003. Some 3.5 million of these were in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 70% of the world's HIV-positive population resides. In contrast, the spread of HIV in high-income countries has slowed since its discovery in the 1980s, and in regions such as Western Europe prevalence has decreased. Here, we employ coalescent methods to compare the epidemic growth rates of two subtypes of HIV-1 with differing epidemiological profiles: subtype C, which is dominant in sub-Saharan Africa and associated with heterosexual transmission, and subtype B, the main cause of AIDS in Western Europe and North America, and which was primarily transmitted through homosexual sex and injecting drug use. We show that although both subtypes emerged at approximately the same time ( approximately 1960), they have widely differing patterns of exponential population growth. At its current growth rate the epidemic of subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa is doubling every 2.4 years, which is approximately half the rate observed during the early stages of the subtype B epidemic in Western Europe and North America. However, the subtype C growth rate is still 5-10 times greater than that estimated for the blood-borne hepatitis C virus, supporting the hypothesis that sexual transmission has been primarily responsible for the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."
3079,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is an important health problem worldwide. The virus has been classified according to 8 genotypes (A-H) based on sequence divergence. Most genotypes have specific geographic distributions; genotypes A and D are prevalent in Western Europe and North America, and genotypes B and C are prevalent in East Asia and Oceania. Currently accepted treatment for chronic hepatitis B includes interferon alpha, or the nucleoside/nucleotide analogues lamivudine and adefovir. The impact of HBV genotypes on response to antiviral therapy has been studied. HBV genotypes D and C are associated with a lower rate of favorable response to interferon alpha therapy than genotypes A and B, respectively. A study in Germany suggested that the rate of resistance to lamivudine was higher in patients with HBV genotype A infection than in patients with genotype D infection. No difference in the risk of lamivudine resistance is found between patients with genotype B and patients with genotype C. In patients with genotype C infection, however, virological response is worse during lamivudine therapy, and is also less durable after the discontinuation of therapy than in patients with genotype B infection. Determining the genotype could be helpful for predicting the outcome of antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B."

Phylogenetic analysis revealed diverse HBV subgenotypes including A2 and A6 (46.8%), D1-D4 (38.8%), E (9.7%), C1 (1.6%), and B2 (1.6%). The study population consisted of patients with different ethnic origin (Caucasian, Turkish, Asian, Arab, and African). One HBV D/C recombinant isolate was identified, which encoded subtype adw2. An HBV subgenotype D4 with an aberrant subtype ayw4 was detected. Although none of the genotypes was associated with a specific disease outcome, several nucleotide substitutions, deletions and insertions were observed within the HBV preS1/S and X genes, particularly among patients with active chronic hepatitis B infection and patients with cirrhosis. Within the immunological domain of the HBsAg gene, the most frequent substitutions were sT125M and sT118A. High rates of precore and basal core promoter mutations were detected in patients infected with genotype D of HBV. Almost half of the patients who received lamivudine therapy for at least 1 year had HBV variants associated with lamivudine drug resistance. In conclusion, the most common HBV genotypes in West Europe (A and D) also prevail in Belgium. The highest degree of genetic diversity was detected in HBV genotype D.

Nineteen hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients (eight with liver cirrhosis and 11 with chronic hepatitis) and 18 healthy controls were studied in a period free of other infection. Mitogen-stimulated cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultured for 24 h. No difference was demonstrated between the patients and healthy controls in the cellular interleukin 2 receptor expression, soluble interleukin 2 receptor release, and interleukin 2 production. Pokeweed mitogen-stimulated interleukin 2 production in lymphocytes from cirrhotic patients was significantly lower than that of the noncirrhotic patients. However, the cellular and soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels did not differ between the two groups of chronic HBV carriers. Despite the fact that it has been suggested that autoreactive T cells have a role in mediating the development of chronic liver diseases associated with HBV infection, this study fails to demonstrate a defective T lymphocyte activation in these patients. The observed reduction of interleukin 2 production from activated lymphocytes may be related to the severity of liver impairment, rather than the HBV infection itself."
3223,0.002,2.0,"The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are promising non-virus-encoded targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy. We describe a selection procedure to isolate mutant forms of RANTES (CCL5) with antiviral activity considerably in excess of that of the native chemokine. The phage-displayed library of randomly mutated and N-terminally extended variants was screened by using live CCR5-expressing cells, and two of the selected mutants, P1 and P2, were further characterized. Both were significantly more potent HIV inhibitors than RANTES, with P2 being the most active (50% inhibitory concentration of 600 pM in a viral coat-mediated cell fusion assay, complete protection of target cells against primary HIV type 1 strains at a concentration of 10 nM). P2 resembles AOP-RANTES in that it is a superagonist of CCR5 and potently induces receptor sequestration. P1, while less potent than P2, has the advantage of significantly reduced signaling activity via CCR5 (30% of that of RANTES). Additionally, both P1 and P2 exhibit not only significantly increased affinity for CCR5 but also enhanced receptor selectivity, retaining only trace levels of signaling activity via CCR1 and CCR3. The phage chemokine approach that was successfully applied here could be adapted to other chemokine-chemokine receptor systems and used to further improve the first-generation mutants reported in this paper."
1002,0.002,2.0,"CD81 has been described as a putative receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV); however, its role in HCV cell entry has not been characterized due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system. We have examined the role of CD81 in HCV glycoprotein-dependent entry by using a recently developed retroviral pseudotyping system. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotypes bearing HCV E1E2 glycoproteins show a restricted tropism for human liver cell lines. Although all of the permissive cell lines express CD81, CD81 expression alone is not sufficient to allow viral entry. CD81 is required for HIV-HCV pseudotype infection since (i) a monoclonal antibody specific for CD81 inhibited infection of susceptible target cells and (ii) silencing of CD81 expression in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells by small interfering RNAs inhibited HIV-HCV pseudotype infection. Furthermore, expression of CD81 in human liver cells that were previously resistant to infection, HepG2 and HH29, conferred permissivity of HCV pseudotype infection. The characterization of chimeric CD9/CD81 molecules confirmed that the large extracellular loop of CD81 is a determinant for viral entry. These data suggest a functional role for CD81 as a coreceptor for HCV glycoprotein-dependent viral cell entry."

This is the first report that describes the detection and serial measurements of anti-ganglioside antibody in a patient with HIV infection.

6155,0.002,2.0,"In hepatitis B virus carriers who are anti-HBe positive despite ongoing viral replication (HBcAg in liver and HBV-DNA in serum) the natural course of hepatitis is severe and the response to interferon is low. We investigated whether a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) strain could be involved. A translational termination codon at the carboxyterminal end of the pre-C region responsible for the lack of HBeAg secretion was found in 18 of 19 HBV clones isolated from seven pedigreed patients with this clinical syndrome. The same findings were confirmed by direct sequencing. One of these patients underwent a liver transplant and HBV infection of the new liver resulted in high titered viremia and intrahepatic expression of HBcAg, without detectable HBeAg in serum. Another patient was superinfected by hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and developed high titres of total and IgM anti-HD. In spite of this, chronic hepatitis remained unchanged during 7 years of follow-up. These data strongly suggest that a viable precore minus mutant of hepatitis B virus is responsible for the lack of HBeAg in the serum of these patients. The HBV variant may explain the peculiar geographic distribution of anti-HBe positive hepatitis. The variations in the virus genome sequence may cause the more severe form of liver disease and modify the pathogenicity in the case of HDV superinfection."

With regard to establishing and/or maintaining virological suppression over 48 weeks in randomized, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was noninferior to elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive adults, and statistically superior (subsequent to established noninferiority) to ongoing treatment with tenofovir DF-containing regimens in ART-experienced adults with virological suppression. In single-arm, phase III trials, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF also provided high rates of virological suppression among ART-naive adolescents and ART-experienced adults with stable renal impairment. In general, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF was well tolerated and associated with more favourable renal and bone parameters, but a less favourable lipid profile, than tenofovir DF-containing regimens. Thus, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir AF is an alternative single-tablet regimen for adults and adolescents with HIV-1 infection, particularly those with an estimated creatinine clearance of ≥30 to <50 mL/min or an increased risk of tenofovir DF-related bone toxicity.

3614,0.002,2.0,"Antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with once-daily dosing of tenofovir and tenofovir-emtricitabine was shown to be effective for preventing HIV-1 infection in individuals who had HIV-1-seropositive partners (the Partners PrEP Study). We developed a population pharmacokinetic model for tenofovir and investigated the impacts of different dose reporting methods. Dosing information was collected as patient-reported dosing information (PRDI) from 404 subjects (corresponding to 1,280 drug concentration records) from the main trial and electronic monitoring-based adherence data collected from 211 subjects (corresponding to 327 drug concentration records) in an ancillary adherence study. Model development was conducted with NONMEM (7.2), using PRDI with a steady-state assumption or using PRDI replaced with electronic monitoring records where available. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption was the best model in both modeling approaches, with the need for an absorption lag time when electronic monitoring-based dosing records were included in the analysis. Age, body weight, and creatinine clearance were significant covariates on clearance, but only creatinine clearance was retained in the final models per stepwise selection. Sex was not a significant covariate on clearance. Tenofovir population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates and the precisions of the parameters from the two final models were comparable with the point estimates of the parameters, differing from 0% to 35%, and bootstrap confidence intervals widely overlapped. These findings indicate that PRDI was sufficient for population pharmacokinetic model development in this study, with a high level of adherence per multiple measures."

A retrospective study was performed in 67 chronic HD and 36 peritoneal dialysis patients. For the screening of viral infections, we tested for anti-HCV antibodies and HBs antigen (Hbs Ag). We compared infected and non-infected patients in order to determine the risk factors for contamination. In the HD unit, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 60% and the prevalence of HBs Ag was 6%. Duration of dialysis (P = 0.001) was the only risk factor in our HD patients. In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the prevalence of anti-HCV was 8%. Hbs Ag was detected in 2.6% of our PD patients. Viral hepatitis C is the main viral infection in our HD unit. The duration of dialysis is the main risk factor for infection in our study. The transmission is essentially nosocomial, requiring a strict adherence to infection control procedures. "

None of the patients had evidence of neurological complications. History of alcohol consumption was an exclusion criterion. The values of central conduction times I-V and III-V showed significant differences between the HIV-seropositive subjects and normal healthy controls, as well as between the HIV-seropositive subjects and HIV-negative drug abusers. Central conduction times I-III showed no differences between groups, except in the left ear of Centers for Disease Control group IV compared with controls. No statistical differences were found in the central conduction times between HIV-negative drug abusers and normal healthy controls. The results suggest a subclinical involvement of the upper brain stem in HIV infection. It could be produced by direct action of the virus on central nervous system structures."

6288,0.002,2.0,"Zidovudine is widely prescribed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Trimethoprim and dapsone are commonly used in the management of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. To examine the pharmacokinetic interactions among these drugs, eight HIV-infected patients (26 to 43 years old) with a mean CD4 count of 524.4 +/- 405.7 cells per mm3 received zidovudine (200 mg), trimethoprim (200 mg), and dapsone (100 mg) as single agents and in two- and three-drug combinations. Blood and urine samples were collected at a specified time and analyzed for zidovudine, zidovudine-glucuronide, trimethoprim, dapsone, and monoacetyl-dapsone concentrations under single-dose and steady-state conditions. Zidovudine did not influence the pharmacokinetic disposition of dapsone or trimethoprim. Dapsone had no effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of zidovudine. Trimethoprim significantly decreased the renal clearance of zidovudine by 58% (5.0 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg of body weight [P < 0.05]). There was a concurrent 54% decrease in the mean urinary recovery of zidovudine (11.7 +/- 3.5 versus 5.4 +/- 3.0 [P < 0.05]), and the metabolic ratio was decreased by 78% (0.32 +/- 0.4 versus 0.07 +/- 0.05 [P < 0.05]). The mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 6 h of the zidovudine-glucuronide/ zidovudine ratio was unchanged. We conclude that zidovudine, trimethoprim, and dapsone can be coadministered to patients with AIDS without significant pharmacokinetic interaction. However, in AIDS patients with liver impairment and impaired glucuronidation, doses of zidovudine may need to be decreased."
7267,0.002,2.0,"Nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is a recognized risk in health care settings, and is a particular concern in settings where human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons receive care. TB control guidelines have been effective in prevention of nosocomial TB outbreaks and protection of patients and health care workers. In 1993 a South Florida academic medical center noted an increase in TB cases, particularly in HIV-infected persons who had been inpatients. A multidisciplinary team developed an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial transmission of TB. The pathway was implemented in 1995 on the Special Immunology/Infectious Disease (SI/ID) inpatient unit. This paper describes an evaluation study conducted to determine the effectiveness of the pathway as an intervention to deter nosocomial TB in relation to two areas: (1) early identification of HIV-infected patients with potential TB, followed by immediate placement in respiratory isolation and (2) protection of SI/ID unit personnel from occupational TB exposure. A retrospective review was conducted in June 1999 on the medical records of all patients who had been placed on the HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway from 1995-1998. A review was also done of the medical center's confirmed TB cases, and employee health records for tuberculin skin testing (TST) of employees during this time period. The review demonstrated that all HIV-infected patients with confirmed TB had been identified, placed on the pathway and admitted to respiratory isolation at the onset of hospital admission, deterring the potential for a nosocomial TB outbreak. However, in 1998 two SI/ID staff converted from a nonreactive to a reactive TST. Although the pathway was only partially successful in TB protection for staff members, other factors may have caused the TST conversions. A study recommendation is that institutions develop an HIV Rule Out TB Critical Pathway, along with a Rule Out TB Pathway for patients who are not HIV-infected but present with symptoms that may be indicative of TB infection."
801,0.002,2.0,"Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is recognised as an important component of collaborative tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activities to reduce the burden of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there has been little in the way of IPT implementation at country level. This failure has resulted in a recent call to arms under the banner title of the 'Three I's' (infection control to prevent nosocomial transmission of TB in health care settings, intensified TB case finding and IPT). In this paper, we review the background of IPT. We then discuss the important challenges of IPT in PLHIV, namely responsibility and accountability for the implementation, identification of latent TB infection, exclusion of active TB and prevention of isoniazid resistance, length of treatment and duration of protective efficacy. We also highlight several research questions that currently remain unanswered. We finally offer practical suggestions about how to scale up IPT in the field, including the need to integrate IPT into a package of care for PLHIV, the setting up of operational projects with the philosophy of 'learning while doing', the development of flow charts for eligibility for IPT, the development and implementation of care prior to antiretroviral treatment, and finally issues around procurement, distribution, monitoring and evaluation. We support the implementation of IPT, but only if it is done in a safe and structured way. There is a definite risk that 'sloppy' IPT will be inefficient and, worse, could lead to the development of multidrug-resistant TB, and this must be avoided at all costs."
4697,0.002,2.0,"Body composition in HIV-infected individuals is subject to many influences. We conducted a pilot 6-month randomized trial of 68 women living with AIDS (WLA) from rural India. High protein intervention combined with education and supportive care delivered by HIV-trained village women (activated social health activist [Asha] life [AL]) was compared to standard protein with usual care delivered by village community assistants (usual care [UC]). Measurements included CD4 counts, ART adherence, socio-demographics, disease characteristics (questionnaires); and anthropometry (bioimpedance analyzer). Repeated measures analysis of variance modeled associations. AL significantly gained in BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, ART adherence, and CD4 counts compared to UC, with higher weight and muscle mass gains among ART adherent (≥66%) participants who had healthier immunity (CD4 ≥450). BMI of WLA improved through high protein supplementation combined with education and supportive care. Future research is needed to determine which intervention aspect was most responsible."
2932,0.002,2.0,"This study determined what physiotherapists in Durban, South Africa know about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), their attitudes towards patients and how they cope as individuals. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire. One-hundred-and-fourteen physiotherapists in Durban hospitals participated in the study. Seventy-two per cent of the questionnaires met the criteria for analysis. Ninety per cent of the participants believed that they knew about HIV/AIDS, but only 78% could identify all viral transmission modes. Of the 38 physiotherapists who believed that they knew the stages of an HIV infection, only 11% actually knew the stages, 28% could not explain them and 61% were vaguely aware. Fifty-six per cent of the respondents had treated patients who had died from HIV/AIDS. Only 38% of physiotherapists were completely at ease when treating HIV/AIDS patients despite the fact that 98% believed that physiotherapy was an integral component of the management of an AIDS patient. Fifty-one per cent of the respondents were unaware of support structures provided by their employers. The authors conclude that the perceptions of physiotherapists about their knowledge about HIV/AIDS do not stand up to scrutiny. Significantly more attention should be paid to the development, implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of educational programmes on HIV/AIDS for physiotherapists in the workplace."
9617,0.002,2.0,"Unintegrated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) DNA are viral DNA products formed naturally during HIV replication. While the integrated proviral DNA form is transcriptionally active and results in productive infection, unintegrated DNA is also capable of expression of viral RNA and proteins. Previously, we showed that HIV Vpr enhances expression from integrase-defective HIV. Here we show that Vpr activation of expression is partially dependent upon the presence of a transcriptionally active HIV promoter and results in increased transcription of unspliced gag and spliced nef viral RNA. While Tat is detectable during infection with integrase-defective HIV, Tat levels are not affected by the presence of Vpr. Mutation studies reveal that Tat is dispensable for the Vpr-mediated enhancement of expression from unintegrated DNA. We find that virion-associated Vpr is sufficient for Nef expression from unintegrated viral DNA, resulting in the efficient downregulation of CD4 from the surface of infected cells. These results provide a mechanism by which Nef expression from unintegrated HIV type 1 DNA expression occurs."
7532,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a direct role in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementia. However, mechanisms underlying HIV-1 gene expression in the CNS are poorly understood. The importance of CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) for HIV-1 expression in cells of the immune system has been recently reported. In this study, we have examined the role and the molecular mechanisms by which proteins of the C/EBP family regulate HIV-1 gene transcription in human brain cells. We found that NF-IL6 acts as a potent activator of the long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven transcription in microglial and oligodendroglioma cells. In contrast, C/EBPgamma inhibits NF-IL6-induced activation. Consistent with previous data, our transient expression results show cell-type-specific NF-IL6-mediated transactivation. In glial cells, full activation needs the presence of the C/EBP binding sites; however, NF-IL6 is still able to function via the minimal -40/+80 region. In microglial cells, C/EBP sites are not essential, since NF-IL6 acts through the -68/+80 LTR region, containing two binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1. Moreover, we show that functional interactions between NF-IL6 and Sp1 lead to synergistic transcriptional activation of the LTR in oligodendroglioma and to mutual repression in microglial cells. We further demonstrate that NF-IL6 physically interacts with the nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF), via its DNA binding domain, in vitro and in cells, which results in mutual transcriptional repression. These findings reveal how the interplay of NF-IL6 and C/EBPgamma, together with Sp1 and COUP-TF, regulates HIV-1 gene transcription in brain cells."

In this study, the possible association between the HBV genomic heterogeneity and intrauterine infection was investigated by comparing the quasi species isolated from eight pairs of HBsAg-positive mothers and their neonates, who were infected intrauterinely with HBV, with clones from eight HBsAg-positive mothers whose neonates were not infected with HBV. The proportion of clones with specific mutations was compared among different subject groups, and phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the significance of specific mutations. It was observed that the core promoter with conserved major functional regions and conserved hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) might be beneficial to HBV maternal-fetal transmission. Particularly, A1762T/G1764A mutations seemed to be disadvantageous for fetal infection. It was also shown that amino acid substitutions located in the immune epitopes of HBsAg were strongly associated with intrauterine HBV transmission. The clones with mutations such as amino acid P110S in preS1 region, P36L in preS2 region and C107R in S region might infect fetuses more readily. In addition, positively selected site analysis confirmed the above results."

Of the 55 subjects studied, major mutations conferring HIV drug resistance were present in 10 (18%). Eight (15%) had nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, with the majority (6) having the K103N mutation; 2 (4%) had nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) mutations; and 2 (4%) had protease inhibitor (PI) mutations. Phenotypic drug resistance was present in 12 (22%) subjects: 10 (18%) for NNRTIs, 2 (4%) for NRTIs, and 3 (5.5%) for PIs. The prevalence of primary HIV-1 drug resistance, particularly to NNRTIs, in this group of recently infected youth was high."

9297,0.002,2.0,"Increased expression of CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain is consistently observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) central nervous system (CNS) disease. The molecular basis for the correlation between increased expression of CCL2 and HIV neuropathogenesis has been linked to a polymorphism at -2578 in the promoter of human CCL2, which was reported to influence the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the predisposition of HIV-infected individuals to develop HIV-associated dementia. However, because the rate of neurological deterioration essentially parallels the progression of immunosuppression, it is inherently difficult to uncouple the influence of this polymorphism on increased progression to AIDS from increased propensity to develop CNS complications. To further investigate the correlation between CCL2 and HIV/SIV CNS disease, the authors sequenced the CCL2 promoter of 29 pigtailed macaques examined in their accelerated and consistent SIV model in which all infected macaques develop AIDS but only 69% developed moderate/severe CNS lesions. Sequence analysis identified 39 sites of nucleotide variation in the pigtailed macaque CCL2 promoter/enhancer regions, with the resulting consensus sequence aligning with 94.7% homology to the human CCL2 promoter. After genetic analyses, no variation was found to correlate with the incidence or severity of CNS lesions or with levels of CCL2 in plasma or CSF. These findings suggest that the determinants of neuropathogenesis in this SIV model are distinct from variation in these regions of the CCL2 promoter."
9879,0.002,2.0,"As antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has become more effective, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. HIV alters HCV clinical presentation, epidemiology, virology, and pathogenesis compared with HCV monoinfected individuals. The incidence of chronic and vertical HCV infection is increased, the rate of hepatic fibrosis progression is accelerated, peripheral and intrahepatic HCV RNA levels are increased, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cirrhosis develop more rapidly in coinfected individuals. Based on these observations, combined with the increased efficacy of ARV therapy, several societies have recommended the diagnosis and treatment of HCV in coinfected individuals. HCV treatment with nonspecific antivirals, pegylated interferon alpha (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), is more complex in coinfected individuals compared with monoinfected individuals because these regimens appear to have decreased efficacy and the incidence of complications is increased. Although new HCV-specific regimens show early promise in HCV monoinfected individuals, it is likely that these agents will be used in combination with nonspecific therapies and additional studies will be required to evaluate their efficacy in coinfected individuals."
7054,0.002,2.0,"Few data are available about the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons with active drug or alcohol addiction and psychiatric disorders. We report the case of a 42-year-old man who entered care with a CD4+ cell count of 78/microL but was reluctant to take many of the available antiretroviral agents. For many years, periods of sobriety and good adherence to antiretroviral medications were interspersed with relapses to heroin, cocaine, and alcohol use as well as episodes of overdose, major depression with psychiatric hospitalization, incarceration, and discontinuation of antiretroviral medications. After 4 years of HIV primary care, the patient was stabilized to begin therapy for hepatitis C with pegylated interferon and ribavirin with the support of a multidisciplinary team. After starting treatment for hepatitis C, the patient achieved an early virologic response and continues to have an undetectable HCV RNA level by polymerase chain reaction testing and 100% adherence to on-site pegylated interferon injections, without adverse events related to his addiction or psychiatric symptoms. This case suggests that HIV-HCV-coinfected persons with the common comorbidities of polysubstance dependence and psychiatric illness may effectively and safely undergo pharmacotherapy for hepatitis C with appropriate support."
1766,0.002,2.0,"Hypersensitivity adverse drug reactions are much more common among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) than in the general population. High rates of hypersensitivity reactions to clindamycin have been noted. To investigate the role of reactive metabolites in these reactions, the authors studied toxicity of clindamycin and sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and their metabolites in uninfected and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected MOLT3 cells. Infected and uninfected cells were incubated with clindamycin or sulphamethoxazole hydroxylamine in increasing concentrations; reactive metabolites were generated by coincubation of cells and drug with murine microsomes and a microsomal activating system. Over a concentration range of 0 to 400 microM SMX-HA, there was a significant concentration-dependent increase in cell death in HIV-infected compared to uninfected cells (28%+/-3% vs 8%+/-5% at 400 microM, P < .05). In contrast, coincubation of cells with clindamycin, microsomes, and a microsomal activating system, as well as combinations of primaquine or pyrimethamine, was not associated with an increase in cell death among infected compared to uninfected cells. No concentration-toxicity was demonstrated. These data support the role of reactive metabolites in adverse drug reactions to sulfonamides during HIV infection, whereas alternate mechanism(s) may be responsible for increased rates of adverse drug reactions to clindamycin among patients with AIDS."
3136,0.002,2.0,"Knowledge is limited regarding decision-making about antiretroviral treatment (ART) from the patient's perspective. This substudy of a longitudinal study of psychobiologic aspects of long-term survival, conducted in 2003, compares the rationales of HIV-positive individuals (n = 79) deciding to take or not to take ART. Inclusion criteria were HIV/AIDS symptoms, or CD4 nadir less than 350, or viral load greater than 55,000. Those not meeting any criteria for receiving ART (2/2003 U.S. DHHS treatment guidelines) were excluded. Diagnosis was on average 11 years ago; 36% were female, 42% African American, 28% Latino, 24% white, and 6% other. Qualitative content analysis of semistructured interviews identified 10 criteria for the decision to take or not to take ART: CD4/viral load counts (87%), quality of life (85%), knowledge/ beliefs about resistance (66%), mind-body beliefs (65%), adverse effects of ART (59%), easy-to-take regimen (58%), spirituality/worldview (58%), drug resistance (41%), experience of HIV/AIDS symptoms (39%), and preference for complementary/alternative medicine (17%). Participants choosing not to take ART (27%) preferred complementary/alternative medicine (r = 0.43, p = 0.001)1, perceived a better quality of life without ART (r = 0.32, p < 0.004), and weighted avoidance of adverse effects of ART more heavily (r = 0.24, p < 0.030) than participants taking ART (73%). Demographic characteristics related to taking ART were having a partner (r = 0.31, p < 0.008) and having health insurance (r = 0.26, p< 0.040). Decisions to take or not to take ART depend not only on patient medical characteristics, but also on individual beliefs about ART, complementary/alternative medicine, spirituality, and mind-body connection. HIV-positive individuals declining treatment place more weight on alternative medicine, avoiding adverse effects and perceiving a better quality of life through not taking ART."
7797,0.002,2.0,"A panel of 14 human IgG monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for envelope antigens of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), 2 high-titer human anti-HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIVIG) preparations, and 15 combinations of MAbs or MAb/HIVIG were tested for their ability to neutralize infection of cultured human T cells (MT-2) with a chimeric simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-vpu+), which expressed HIV-1 IIIB envelope antigens. Eleven MAbs and both HIVIGs were neutralizing. When used alone, the anti-CD4-binding site MAb b12, the anti-gp41 MAb 2F5, and the anti-gp120 MAb 2G12 were the most potent. When combination regimens involving two MAbs targeting different epitopes were tested, synergy was seen in all paired MAbs, except for one combination that revealed additive effects. The lowest effective antibody concentration for 50% viral neutralization (EC50) and EC90 were achieved with combinations of MAbs b12, 2F5, 2G12, and the anti-V3 MAb 694/98D. Depending on the combination regimen, the concentration of MAbs required to reach 90% virus neutralization was reduced approximately 2- to 25-fold as compared to the dose requirement of individual MAbs to produce the same effect. Synergy of the combination regimens implies that combinations of antibodies may have a role in passive immunoprophylaxis against HIV-1. The ability of SHIV to replicate in rhesus macaques will allow us to test such approaches in vivo."
6896,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frequently co-exist due to shared routes of transmission. In the past, the impact of HCV on overall morbidity and mortality of coinfected patients was minimal due to the poor prognosis of HIV. However, since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), HCV has become a significant pathogen in this population. HIV clearly exacerbates HCV infection and accelerates progression to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is debate over whether HCV influences the natural history of HIV. Given the high prevalence of coinfection and the accelerated liver damage, HCV treatment has become a priority in these patients. There are new data on pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy for HCV in coinfected patients. The therapy is well tolerated and safe, although it appears to be slightly less effective than in monoinfected patients. The risk of HAART-related hepatotoxicity is greater in coinfected patients and therefore requires special consideration and close monitoring."
4478,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the most prevalent public health problems worldwide, and causes 1 million deaths annually. In Bangladesh, information about prevalence of HBV infection is scarce, and there is no available data on HDV infection. We determined rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc seropositivity in asymptomatic, healthy children (n = 181) and adults (n = 354) presenting to referral facilities in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and tested a separate group of HBsAg-positive patients (n = 180) for prevalence of HDV. Testing of serum was also performed for signs of liver disease. Overall, seropositivity of HBsAg and anti-HBc in studied subjects was 3 per cent (16/534) and 21.1 per cent (113/534), respectively. Prevalence of HBsAg was highest in the 5- to 9-year-old (8.5 per cent, 7/82) and 10- to 14-year-old (5.9 per cent, 2/34) age groups. Unlike HBsAg, prevalence of anti-HBc was lower in children (14.9 per cent in those below the age of 15) than adults (24.4 per cent in those aged 20-34 years) (p < 0.05). Most HBsAg-positive individuals were symptomatic (n = 125, 69.4 per cent). A high rate (24.4 per cent, 44/180) of simultaneous infection with HDV was observed among HBsAg-positive subjects, with higher rates in older individuals. Anti-HDV seropositivity rate was similar among asymptomatic (21.8 per cent, 12/55) and symptomatic (25.6 per cent, 32/125) HBsAg carriers. Our data suggest that Bangladesh is of moderate endemicity for HBV infection, and has relatively high rates of co-infection with HDV. Control HBV and HDV infection in Bangladesh may be best achieved by targeting preschool children, which could fit readily within the existing EPI schedule."

Twenty-four HIV-1-infected subjects received lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily prior to and during the study: 6 each with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (and hepatitis C virus coinfected) and 12 with normal hepatic function. Mild and moderate hepatic impairment showed similar effects on lopinavir pharmacokinetics. When the 2 hepatic impairment groups were combined, lopinavir Cmax and AUC12 were increased 20% to 30% compared to the controls. Hepatic impairment increased unbound lopinavir AUC12 by 68% and Cmax by 56%. The effect of hepatic impairment on low-dose ritonavir pharmacokinetics was more pronounced in the moderate impairment group (181% and 221% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively) than in the mild impairment group (39% and 61% increase in AUC12 and Cmax, respectively). While lopinavir/ritonavir dose reduction is not recommended in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised in this population."

Seven of them had lymphoblastic leukaemia and others had solid tumours. Seven cases were male. Mean age was 10.5 years with a range of 5-16 years. Chronic Hepatitis B was diagnosed biochemically, serologically and histopathologically. They were HBsAg(+), HBV-DNA(+), and HCV(-), HIV(-). Seven cases were HBeAg(+) and two of them were anti-Delta IgG(+). Liver biopsy revealed chronic active hepatitis in six cases and persistent hepatitis in three cases. IFN was given at the dose of 5 MU/m2 three times a week, subcutaneously for 6 months. It was well tolerated. After IFN therapy, ALT levels returned to normal in seven cases. All cases were still HBsAg(+). Four of them seroconverted to anti-HBe antibody. Loss of serum HBV-DNA in three cases, but 11 cases showed a marked decrease after IFN. The control liver biopsies showed that histopathological activity index was diminished in five cases. Other 16 patients, serving as control, received no therapy. Five of them were leukaemia and others were solid tumours. Twelve cases were male. Mean age was 9.3 years with a range of 4-19 years. After 6 months, only one patient lost HBV-DNA and three of them seroconverted to anti-HBe with normalization of ALT values. In our study, IFN treatment favourably influenced the progress of chronic hepatitis B in children with cancer."
3696,0.002,2.0,"Children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have T helper cell deficiency, but frequent bacterial infections suggest phagocyte dysfunction. Whole blood chemiluminescence (CL) assays were used to measure the respiratory burst capacity of phagocytes from HIV-infected children, perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected children, and normal healthy children. Phagocytes were stimulated by zymosan opsonized with human complement with and without priming by platelet-activating factor (PAF) or FMLP. Activities of enzymes involved in the respiratory burst, oxidase and myeloperoxidase, were examined after opsonin receptor-independent stimulation with PMA. Unprimed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased for HIV-infected children with severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression compared with healthy children (P=.03), and PAF-primed CL responses to opsonized zymosan were decreased in HIV-infected children with both moderate and severe CD4 lymphocyte suppression (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively), despite normal or increased activities of the respiratory burst enzymes. These impairments may contribute to secondary bacterial infections."
5944,0.002,2.0,We administered a questionnaire pertaining to recent gains in knowledge about HIV/AIDS treatment and natural history in mid-1990 to all physicians and nurses at a 455-bed public teaching hospital. Surveys were returned by 127 physicians (46%) and 541 nurses (77%). Responses indicated that only 37% of physicians and 18% of nurses knew that the risk for an AIDS-related opportunistic infection becomes significant when the T-helper cell count falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter. One-fourth of physicians (23%) and more than one-half of nurses (55%) were not aware that the HIV enzyme immunoassay test alone is insufficient to properly determine a patient's HIV serostatus. The survey results revealed a broad deficit in knowledge about the natural history and treatment of HIV infection and demonstrated the need for a clinically relevant core HIV/AIDS knowledge curriculum and for strategies to better educate health care providers to improve care given to HIV-infected patients.
7348,0.002,2.0,"Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways."
264,0.002,2.0,"We asked whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease plays a major role in the early stages of infection (i.e. from viral entry to reverse transcription) by using various protease inhibitors (saquinavir, ritonavir, and KNI-272). When assessed in the two-day multinuclear activation of a galactosidase indicator (MAGI) assay, involving a single cycle of HIV-1 replication, all protease inhibitors failed to block infection of HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells by HIV-1, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors (AZT and ddI) completely blocked the infection. Moreover, when HIV-1 proviral DNA synthesis was examined by polymerase chain reaction in HeLa-CD4-LTR-beta-gal cells exposed to HIV-1 and cultured in the presence of protease inhibitors, a significant amount of proviral DNA was detected, while no proviral DNA synthesis was detected when the cells were cultured in the presence of RT inhibitors. Protease inhibitors also failed to block chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression in HLCD4-CAT cells exposed to HIV-1, while RT inhibitors completely suppressed CAT expression. These results strongly suggest, contrary to a previous report by Nagy et al. (1994), that HIV-1 protease does not play a major role in the early stages of infection."
8643,0.002,2.0,"Nelfinavir mesylate (formerly AG1343) is a potent and selective, nonpeptidic inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease that was discovered by protein structure-based design methodologies. We evaluated the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the clinically approved antiretroviral therapeutics zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), dideoxycytidine (ddC; zalcitabine), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), indinavir, saquinavir, and ritonavir and a three-drug combination of nelfinavir with ZDV and 3TC against an acute HIV-1 strain RF infection of CEM-SS cells in vitro. Quantitative assessment of drug interaction was evaluated by a universal response surface approach (W. R. Greco, G. Bravo, and J. C. Parsons, Pharm. Rev. 47:331-385, 1995) and by the method of M. N. Prichard and C. Shipman (Antiviral Res. 14:181-206, 1990). Both analytical methods yielded similar results and showed that the two-drug combinations of nelfinavir with the reverse transcriptase inhibitors ZDV, 3TC, ddI, d4T, and ddC and the three-drug combination with ZDV and 3TC resulted in additive to statistically significant synergistic interactions. In a similar manner, the combination of nelfinavir with the three protease inhibitors resulted in additive (ritonavir and saquinavir) to slightly antagonistic (indinavir) interactions. In all combinations, minimal cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any drug alone and in combination. These results suggest that administration of combinations of the appropriate doses of nelfinavir with other currently approved antiretroviral therapeutic agents in vivo may result in enhanced antiviral activity with no associated increase in cellular cytotoxicity."
3512,0.002,2.0,"A very small proportion of people remain negative for HIV infection after repeated HIV-1 viral exposure, which is called HIV-1 resistance. Understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 resistance is important for the development of HIV-1 vaccines and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) therapies. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-resistant individuals and HIV-susceptible individuals. One hundred eighty-five discriminative HIV-1 resistance genes were identified using the Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) methods. The virus protein target enrichment analysis of the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes suggested that the HIV-1 protein nef might play an important role in HIV-1 infection. Moreover, we identified 29 infection information exchanger genes from the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes based on a virus-host interaction network analysis. The infection information exchanger genes are located on the shortest paths between virus-targeted proteins and are important for the coordination of virus infection. These proteins may be useful targets for AIDS prevention or therapy, as intervention in these pathways could disrupt communication with virus-targeted proteins and HIV-1 infection."
6260,0.002,2.0,"After the transition from the acute to the chronic phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, complement mediates long-term storage of virions in germinal centers (GC) of lymphoid tissue. The contribution of particular complement receptors (CRs) to virus trapping in GC was studied on tonsillar specimens from HIV-infected individuals. CR2 (CD21) was identified as the main binding site for HIV in GC. Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) blocking the CR2-C3d interaction were shown to detach 62 to 77% of HIV type 1 from tonsillar cells of an individual in the presymptomatic stage. Although they did so at a lower efficiency, these antibodies were able to remove HIV from tonsillar cells of patients under highly active antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that the C3d-CR2 interaction remains a primary entrapment mechanism in treated patients as well. In contrast, removal of HIV was not observed with MAb blocking CR1 or CR3. Thus, targeting CR2 may facilitate new approaches toward a reduction of residual virus in GC."
7187,0.002,2.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors has led to dramatic decrease in the morbidity and mortality resulting from infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1. However, this combination regimen can be associated with the occurrence of serious toxicities, which may reduce patient compliance. In particular, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors and nevirapine among nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have the potential for producing hepatotoxicity. We summarise current knowledge of the hepatotoxic effects associated with the commercially available human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitors based on a literature review of the major retrospective and prospective clinical studies designed to elucidate risk factors for developing hepatotoxicity among human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy containing protease inhibitors. Coinfection with chronic hepatitis, a common occurrence in human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients, is identified as an independent risk factor for developing hepatotoxicity in antiretroviral-treated human immunodeficiency virus-1-infected patients treated with antiretroviral regimens containing protease inhibitors. The importance of other risk factors for developing protease inhibitor-associated hepatotoxicity and the mechanism underlying the drug-related hepatotoxicity are discussed. The data indicate that the potential for producing hepatotoxicity is variable among the protease inhibitors and suggest that based on differences in drug-related hepatotoxicity, certain protease inhibitors may be preferred for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients."

8764,0.002,2.0,"All classes of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy have been associated with asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) levels, and much less frequently with serious, and at times life threatening, clinical liver hepatotoxicity. The relationship between the risk of developing serious clinical liver injury and the rate and severity of elevated asymptomatic ALT/AST levels is poorly understood. Boehringer Ingelheim has recently completed the Viramune Hepatic Safety Project; its primary objective was to identify risk factors for antiretroviral-associated hepatotoxicity. Data from 1731 nevirapine-treated patients and 1912 control patients who took part in Boehringer Ingelheim-controlled clinical trials as well as 814 nevirapine-treated patients in uncontrolled trials were analyzed. Risk factors for asymptomatic ALT/AST elevations during nevirapine therapy included baseline elevations of ALT/AST levels > 2.5x upper limit of normal (RR = 4.3, p < .01) and co-infection with hepatitis B (RR = 2.3, p < .01) or hepatitis C (RR = 5.2, p < .01). An analysis of ALT/AST elevations > 5x ULN for patients stratified by baseline CD4 cell count demonstrated that men with > or = 400 CD4 cells/mm3 were at increased risk of asymptomatic transaminase elevations while taking nevirapine (RR = 1.6, p < .01). No consistent CD4 cell count cutoff could be identified in women that was associated with an increased risk of ALT/AST elevations. Analyses from five large observational cohorts (N = 8711) demonstrated no significant differences in the rate of serious hepatic events among antiretroviral regimens, including between the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors nevirapine and efavirenz. Use of nevirapine was not associated with a significantly increased risk of clinical hepatotoxic events, including liver failure or liver related death, compared to therapy with other antiretroviral drugs."
3646,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) elite controllers (EC) maintain viremia below the limit of commercial assay detection (<50 RNA copies/ml) in the absence of antiviral therapy, but the mechanisms of control remain unclear. HLA-B57 and the closely related allele B*5801 are particularly associated with enhanced control and recognize the same Gag(240-249) TW10 epitope. The typical escape mutation (T242N) within this epitope diminishes viral replication capacity in chronically infected persons; however, little is known about TW10 epitope sequences in residual replicating viruses in B57/B*5801 EC and the extent to which mutations within this epitope may influence steady-state viremia. Here we analyzed TW10 in a total of 50 B57/B*5801-positive subjects (23 EC and 27 viremic subjects). Autologous plasma viral sequences from both EC and viremic subjects frequently harbored the typical cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-selected mutation T242N (15/23 sequences [65.2%] versus 23/27 sequences [85.1%], respectively; P = 0.18). However, other unique mutants were identified in HIV controllers, both within and flanking TW10, that were associated with an even greater reduction in viral replication capacity in vitro. In addition, strong CTL responses to many of these unique TW10 variants were detected by gamma interferon-specific enzyme-linked immunospot assay. These data suggest a dual mechanism for durable control of HIV replication, consisting of viral fitness loss resulting from CTL escape mutations together with strong CD8 T-cell immune responses to the arising variant epitopes."
8481,0.002,2.0,"Behaviors associated with transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were measured in a sample of 60 adults with a severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). Results revealed that 68% had sex in the last year; 13% of men and 30% of women reported two or more male partners, and 24% of men also reported two or more female partners. Condom use was inconsistent. Sex partners were often met in a psychiatric clinic or bar, and a substantial number were injection drug users or known to be non-monogamous. Overall, 48% of men and 37% of women reported at least one risk factor. Hypothesized psychological antecedents of HIV-related risk behavior were also measured, including knowledge, motivation for risk reduction, and self-efficacy regarding risk-reduction. Many participants were misinformed regarding HIV-transmission and risk reduction. Motivational indices indicated that attitudes toward condoms were slightly positive, and that social norms were generally supportive of condom use. However, participants tended to rate themselves at only slight risk for infection, undermining their motivation for condom use. Participants indicated only modest levels of self-efficacy in situations requiring sexual assertiveness. These findings, coupled with the elevated seroprevalence of HIV among persons having a SPMI, point to the need for risk assessment and counseling by mental health care providers."
2866,0.002,2.0,"To investigate cellular factors involved in HIV-1 chronic infection, three cell lines chronically infected with the same HIV-1 viral isolate (s61) were studied by cDNA microarray analysis. Two T cell lines, H61 and M61, showed the characteristics of a persistent infection whereas U61 cell line displayed a latent infection pattern. Analysis of genes with altered expression in the three cell lines revealed evidence of apoptosis control by up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes. In addition, cell cycle control was affected in the two persistent T cell lines particularly through the down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A/p21). Moreover, each cell line showed specific characteristics, like in M61 cells, genes related with cellular activation and with cell migration and motility. In U61 cells, genes associated with immune response were activated. Genes with altered expression in our experiments, and not previously related with HIV such as ANXA 1 or CFLAR were detected and validated. This work revealed that different cell mechanism such as control of apoptosis and cell cycle are important for ""in vitro"" HIV-1 chronic infections, and discovered new genes previously not related with HIV-1 replication."
9768,0.002,2.0,"Four HHV-6 strains were initially isolated during attempts to observe HIV-1 replication in cultured primary lymphocytes from 48 patients with AIDS. HHV-6 DNA from each strain was extracted from primary cell cultures and amplified using specific primers in a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. All HHV-6 strains were classified as B variants by submitting the PCR products to the digestion of two restriction enzymes (Hind III and Bgl II). Since in primary cultures, the appearance of HHV-6 cytopathic effect was followed by a progressive reduction of HIV-1 replication, we tried to reproduce the observed inhibition in vitro. Two HHV-6 strains, used throughout the experiments, showed their ability to suppress HIV-1 replication when the viruses co-infected CD4+T lymphocyte cultures. While the intrinsic mechanism of this finding still remains unclear, the inhibition of HIV-1 replication was observed only when a high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of HHV-6 and a low m.o.i. of HIV-1 were used in dually infected cell cultures. By using a semiquantitative determination of HIV-1 cDNA by PCR, it appears that the inhibition begins in infected cell cultures and, once established, does not allow any further HIV-1 replication."
1642,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of AIDS, originated from simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees (SIVcpz), the precursor of the human virus, approximately 100 years ago. This indicates that HIV-1 has emerged through the cross-species transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to humans. However, it remains unclear how SIVcpz has evolved into pandemic HIV-1 in humans. To address this question, we inoculated three SIVcpz strains (MB897, EK505, and MT145), four pandemic HIV-1 strains (NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), and two nonpandemic HIV-1 strains (YBF30 and DJO0131). Humanized mice infected with SIVcpz strain MB897, a virus phylogenetically similar to pandemic HIV-1, exhibited a peak viral load comparable to that of mice infected with pandemic HIV-1, while peak viral loads of mice infected with SIVcpz strain EK505 or MT145 as well as nonpandemic HIV-1 strains were significantly lower. These results suggest that SIVcpz strain MB897 is preadapted to humans, unlike the other SIVcpz strains. Moreover, viral RNA sequencing of MB897-infected humanized mice identified a nonsynonymous mutation in "
6148,0.002,2.0,"Two hundred eleven male street prostitutes between the ages of 18 and 51 years were interviewed and tested for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Economic, social, and emotional barriers to the reduction of HIV-related risk behavior were examined within the context of several concepts present in the Health Belief Model (HBM). Three lifestyle factors were found to function as barriers to engaging in risk reduction behavior. Subjects who were more economically dependent on prostitution, perceived less control over the hustling encounter, and reported increased pleasure from sexual activity with their customers were more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior. Prostitutes' perception of the severity of HIV infection was not significantly associated with their risk behavior. Unexpected findings indicated that increases in perceived susceptibility to HIV and perceived benefit of condom use for HIV prevention were significantly related to increased risk-taking behavior. Practical applications of findings in the design and implementation of future HIV-related preventive health education programs are discussed."
4961,0.002,2.0,"Although vaccines and antiretroviral (ARV) prevention have demonstrated partial success against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in clinical trials, their combined introduction could provide more potent protection. Furthermore, combination approaches could ameliorate the potential increased risk of infection following vaccination in the absence of protective immunity. We used a nonhuman primate model to determine potential interactions of combining a partially effective ARV microbicide with an envelope-based vaccine. The vaccine alone provided no protection from infection following 12 consecutive low-dose intravaginal challenges with simian-HIV strain SF162P3, with more animals infected compared to naive controls. The microbicide alone provided a 68% reduction in the risk of infection relative to that of the vaccine group and a 45% reduction relative to that of naive controls. The vaccine-microbicide combination provided an 88% reduction in the per-exposure risk of infection relative to the vaccine alone and a 79% reduction relative to that of the controls. Protected animals in the vaccine-microbicide group were challenged a further 12 times in the absence of microbicide and demonstrated a 98% reduction in the risk of infection. A total risk reduction of 91% was observed in this group over 24 exposures (P = 0.004). These important findings suggest that combined implementation of new biomedical prevention strategies may provide significant gains in HIV prevention."

Amplification of at least one gene was successful for 144 isolates. All three genes were obtained for 136 isolates. Subtyping showed that CRF01_AE was predominant (130 cases). According to the ANRS September 2004 list, polymorphism substitutions (>50% versus the subtype B consensus) of CRF01_AE at drug resistance positions were observed only in protease: I13V (81%), E35D (87%), M36I (100%), R41K (96%), and H69K (100%). Two strains bore one major resistance mutation to PIs: M46I and N88D. Five other strains carried drug resistance mutations to RTIs: K70R (one strain), V75M (three strains), and K101E (one strain). Of the isolates 4.9% had drug resistance mutations to antiretroviral drugs."
8024,0.002,2.0,"High levels of HIV-1 replication during the chronic phase of infection usually correlate with rapid progression to severe immunodeficiency. However, a minority of highly viremic individuals remains asymptomatic and maintains high CD4⁺ T cell counts. This tolerant profile is poorly understood and reminiscent of the widely studied nonprogressive disease model of SIV infection in natural hosts. Here, we identify transcriptome differences between rapid progressors (RPs) and viremic nonprogressors (VNPs) and highlight several genes relevant for the understanding of HIV-1-induced immunosuppression. RPs were characterized by a specific transcriptome profile of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells similar to that observed in pathogenic SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In contrast, VNPs exhibited lower expression of interferon-stimulated genes and shared a common gene regulation profile with nonpathogenic SIV-infected sooty mangabeys. A short list of genes associated with VNP, including CASP1, CD38, LAG3, TNFSF13B, SOCS1, and EEF1D, showed significant correlation with time to disease progression when evaluated in an independent set of CD4⁺ T cell expression data. This work characterizes 2 minimally studied clinical patterns of progression to AIDS, whose analysis may inform our understanding of HIV pathogenesis."

The IDU population increased 70% from 2000 to 2004 and is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS -- the country's second leading cause of death. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) share transmission routes with HIV and cause serious medical consequences. This study aimed to determine risk factors for acquisition of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among IDUs in a northern province. We conducted a matched case-control study among active IDUs aged 18-45 who participated in a community-based survey (30-minute interview and serologic testing). Each HIV-infected IDU (case) was matched with one HIV-uninfected IDU (control) by age, sex (males only), and study site (128 pairs). Similar procedures were used for HBV infection (50 pairs) and HCV infection (65 pairs). Conditional logistic regression models were fit to identify risk factors for each infection. Among 309 surveyed IDUs, the HIV, HBV, and HCV prevalence was 42.4%, 80.9%, and 74.1%, respectively. Only 11.0% reported having been vaccinated against hepatitis B. While 13.3% of the IDUs reported sharing needles (past six months), 63.8% engaged in indirect sharing practices (past six months), including sharing drug solutions, containers, rinse water, and frontloading drugs. In multivariable models, sharing drugs through frontloading was significantly associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR]=2.8), HBV infection (OR=3.8), and HCV infection (OR=4.6). We report an unrecognized association between sharing drugs through frontloading and higher rates of HIV, HBV and HCV infections among male IDUs in Vietnam. This finding may have important implications for bloodborne viral prevention for IDUs in Vietnam."

The aim of this study is to measure the risk of having adverse neonatal outcomes: preterm delivery (<37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (<2500 g at birth), and preterm and low-birth-weight baby (<37 weeks of gestation and <2500 g at birth) associated with the presence of periodontitis in HIV-infected women."
117,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral drug resistance mutations prevent successful outcome of treatment and lead to worsening of liver disease. Detection of its emergence permits opportune treatment with alternative drugs. Unfortunately, the use of newly approved antivirals, including adefovir dipivoxil, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, is also associated with the development of drug resistance, albeit to a lesser extent than the use of lamivudine. The objectives of this work were to assess the performance characteristics (sensitivity and accuracy) of an updated drug resistance test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, which includes detection of mutations associated with lamivudine, adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine resistance, and to compare the results with consensus sequencing of serum samples from patients treated with HBV antivirals. Diagnostic sensitivity, defined as detection of a positive amplification line on the line probe assay (LiPA) strip, was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.7 to 97.9) after initial testing, increasing to 96.3% (95% CI, 91.6 to 98.8) after repeat test 1 and to 100% (95% CI, 97.3 to 100.0) after repeat test 2. In diagnostic accuracy determinations, full concordance was observed between sequencing and LiPA for 77.0% of the codons tested (620/805 codons [95% CI, 74.0 to 79.9]), whereas LiPA and sequencing were partially concordant 22% of the time (177/805 codons). In 167 out of 177 cases, LiPA detected a wild-type/mutant mixture whereas sequencing detected only one of the two results. Performance testing of the new LiPA test, the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2, showed convincing diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy. The ability of the test to detect mixed infections and minority viral populations associated with resistance to the current generation of antivirals, including adefovir, emtricitabine, and telbivudine, makes it a useful tool for HBV therapy monitoring."

1048,0.002,2.0,"Extracorporeal photochemotherapy (photopheresis), an immunomodulatory therapy that targets circulating T helper lymphocytes, has been applied to the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Any therapy that exerts its actions on CD4+ T cells has the potential of exacerbating HIV infection. Therefore, it was necessary to observe immune function during treatment. Because cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural-killer cells are thought to play an important role in the response against HIV infection, we examined the effect of photopheresis on HIV cytolytic activity. The study group consisted of seven patients with late-stage HIV disease who had not received any previous treatment for HIV infection. Patients were treated exclusively with photopheresis on two consecutive days each month for 14-32 months (average, 25 months). Peripheral lymphocytes, collected at various points during treatment, were used as effectors in a 51Cr release assay. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed autologous B cell lines transfected with recombinant vaccinia vectors that expressed the HIV env (gp120, gp41) and gag (p24) proteins were used as target cells. All seven patients demonstrated relatively constant levels of cytolysis (>10% above controls) during treatment in the context of stable CD4+ T cell counts and a stable clinical status. These results suggest that extracorporeal photochemotherapy did not impair the cytolytic response to HIV infection and may have enhanced it in some patients."

Lesions less commonly recorded include oral ulceration (2.9%) and Kaposi's sarcoma (1.5%). The clinical range of lesions seen is similar to those reported elsewhere, but socio-cultural differences allowed no reliable comparison. More than a quarter of our patients had oral soft tissue discomfort necessitating treatment; in 3.3% these were the presenting symptom.

2836,0.002,2.0,"The use of rapid tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has become standard in HIV testing algorithms employed in resource-limited settings. We report an extensive HIV rapid test validation study conducted among Ugandan blood bank donors at low risk for HIV infection. The operational characteristics of four readily available commercial HIV rapid test kits were first determined with 940 donor samples and were used to select a serial testing algorithm. Uni-Gold Recombigen HIV was used as the screening test, followed by HIV-1/2 STAT-PAK for reactive samples. OraQuick HIV-1 testing was performed if the first two test results were discordant. This algorithm was then tested with 5,252 blood donor samples, and the results were compared to those of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and Western blotting. The unadjusted algorithm sensitivity and specificity were 98.6 and 99.9%, respectively. The adjusted sensitivity and specificity were 100 and 99.96%, respectively. This HIV testing algorithm is a suitable alternative to EIAs and Western blotting for Ugandan blood donors."
6303,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 isolates from 18 initially symptom-free men who were treated with zidovudine for 2 years were investigated for drug sensitivity. At the start all the men had persistent core antigenaemia; the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 6 during the study. The polymerase chain reaction was used to detect mutations at residue 215 of reverse transcriptase, a mutation associated with reduced drug sensitivity. After 2 years 16/18 isolates were mutant. However, after about 6 months of treatment the mutation was detected in only 7 isolates, 4 from individuals who subsequently had AIDS. Limited direct virus sensitivity data correlated with the genetic data. The rate of appearance of the 215 mutation seemed to correlate with CD4 counts and viral virulence."
7876,0.002,2.0,"A distinct clinical syndrome of cholestasis and hepatitis occurred during early infancy in seven infants with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. In five infants hepatitis was the first manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection. The median age of onset of hepatitis was 7 months (range, 5 to 10 months). The mean total bilirubin concentration at presentation was 7.4 mg/dl (range, 3.9 to 11 mg/dl), the mean aspartate aminotransferase was 1512 IU/liter (range, 782 to 2960 IU/liter) and the mean alanine amino-transferase 512 IU/liter (range, 92 to 1247 IU/liter). The absolute CD4 count at the time of onset of hepatitis ranged from 191 to 2298 cells/mm3 (mean, 766 cells/mm3). Six of the seven children died within 12 weeks of onset of hepatitis, three as a result of complications of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and two died of complications secondary to cytomegalovirus. In only one infant was the cause of death the direct consequence of liver failure. The seventh infant died 17 months after the onset of hepatitis of dilated cardiomyopathy. No specific etiologic agent has been identified as the cause of cholestatic hepatitis in these infants. In situ hybridization studies to detect human immunodeficiency virus 1 messenger RNA was negative in the liver tissue obtained at biopsy and autopsy in five of the samples tested."
9409,0.002,2.0,"Ribavirin was administered orally in escalating doses for 2 or 4 weeks to 15 symptom-free, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive homosexual men with generalized lymphadenopathy. Reverse transcriptase activity was inhibited during therapy when steady-state plasma concentrations were greater than 6 mumol/L. These concentrations were achieved with 1200 or 2400 mg/day for 2 weeks or a loading dose of 2400 mg/day for 3 days followed by 600 mg/day for 4 weeks. Drug accumulation occurred at all doses. The elimination half-life appeared to be approximately 2 weeks. Reversible adverse reactions, principally resulting in central nervous system symptoms and anemia, correlated with dose and duration of therapy. Immunologic enhancement of T-lymphocyte-mediated mitogen-induced responses was observed in the majority of patients who had reduction in reverse transcriptase activity. However, specific T4+ lymphocyte-mediated antigen-induced responses increased to within the normal range in only three patients. Significant enhancement appeared to correlate with the severity of baseline antigen-induced functional impairment. These data indicate that oral ribavirin can be given for at least 1 month with acceptable toxicity at doses that appear to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus replication."

To understand the dynamics of the HIV epidemic, male IDU (n = 561) were recruited from the needle/syringe exchange program in Dhaka in 2002, who underwent a risk-behavior survey and were tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B. Correlates of HIV infection were determined by conducting bivariate and multiple regression analyses. The median age of the IDU was 35 years, 39.6% had no formal education, approximately half were married and/or living with their regular sex partner and 26% were currently homeless. The median age at first injection was 29 years. HIV was detected in 5.9% of the IDU and homelessness was the only factor independently associated with HIV (OR = 5.5). Urgent measures must be undertaken to prevent escalation of the HIV epidemic. The study's limitations are noted."

People with HIV infection are both more likely to contract primary tuberculosis and at greater risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Tuberculous disease may present with atypical signs and symptoms in HIV-infected hosts because of alterations in the immune system. Superimposed on the virulent interaction of HIV and tuberculosis is the emerging problem of multidrug resistant strains that often resist currently available therapies. HIV-positive health professionals working in high-risk environments pose a special problem, while populations unable to comply with currently available pharmacological therapies pose another. We have many tools available to combat the resurgence of tuberculosis, but new methods of diagnosis and new approaches to treatment are sorely needed."
1686,0.002,2.0,"To examine trends in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) mortality in the United States, we analyzed PML death rates and deaths for 1979 through 1994, using US multiple cause-of-death data. During the 16-year study period 3,894 PML deaths were reported. The age-adjusted death rate increased more than 20-fold, from less than 0.2 per million persons before 1984 to 3.3 per million persons in 1994. The increase was attributable to infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which was recorded on 2,267 (89.0%) of 2.546 death records from 1991 through 1994. PML age-adjusted death rates increased abruptly for all males beginning in 1984 and for black females in 1990. Only a small increase was observed for white females. In 1994, PML was reported in 2.1% of white males who died with HIV-associated disease compared with 1.2% of white females and 1.0% of black males and females who died of similar causes. The epidemic of PML deaths is increasing in parallel with the AIDS epidemic. The increase in HIV-associated PML deaths, first noted among males, has also become apparent among females and probably reflects the increasing importance of drug use and heterosexual transmission of HIV. The reason for the higher prevalence of PML among white males with HIV infection is unknown."
4423,0.002,2.0,"These recommendations were developed by the U.S. Public Health Service to address the increasing epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women and their infants. The recommendations stress the importance of early diagnosis of HIV infection for the health of both women and their infants and are based on advances made in HIV-related treatment and prevention. The most significant advance for this population has been the results from a placebo-controlled, clinical trial that indicated that administration of zidovudine to HIV-infected pregnant women and their newborns reduced the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV by approximately two thirds (1). This document recommends routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing for all pregnant women and is intended to serve as guidance for health-care providers in educating women about the importance of knowing their HIV infection status. For uninfected women, such HIV counseling and testing programs can provide information that can reduce their risk for acquiring HIV; for women who have HIV infection, these programs can enable them to receive appropriate and timely medical interventions for their own health and for reducing the risk for perinatal (i.e., mother to infant) and other modes of HIV transmission. These programs also can facilitate appropriate follow-up care and services for HIV-infected women, their infants, and other family members."

4411,0.002,2.0,"The envelope protein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 forms homo-oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum. The oligomeric structure of Env is maintained after cleavage in a Golgi compartment and transport to the surfaces of infected cells, where incorporation into budding virions takes place. Here, we use biophysical techniques to assess the oligomeric valency of virion-associated Env prior to fusion activation. Virion-associated Env oligomers were stabilized by chemical cross-linking prior to detergent extraction and were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. Gel filtration revealed a single predominant oligomeric species, and sedimentation equilibrium analysis-derived mass values indicated a trimeric structure. Determination of the masses of individual Env molecules by scanning transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that virion-associated Env was trimeric, and a triangular morphology was observed in 20 to 30% of the molecules. These results, which firmly establish the oligomeric structure of human immunodeficiency virus virion-associated Env, parallel those of our previous analysis of the simian immunodeficiency virus Env."

Data were collected through interviews collected in participants' homes. Participants were 151 adults with diagnoses of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Time since diagnosis, health status, health care, ethnicity, gender, religion, and emotional distress were examined as mediators of pain symptoms, pain distress, and anticipatory pain. Almost all participants (83%) reported AIDS-related pain in the last 3 months. Unexpectedly, pain was negatively associated with time since diagnosis with AIDS. Pain symptoms and pain distress tended to vary by ethnicity, with Latinos expressing more symptoms and pain distress than African Americans. Anticipatory pain varied significantly by gender and religion, with women, Catholics, and Protestants anticipating pain more than men and non-Christians. Anxiety, depression, and general emotional distress were significantly associated with pain symptoms (r = 0.44, 0.33, 0.47) and pain distress (r = 0.34, 0.31, 0.34). Health status and health care were unrelated to pain symptoms, pain distress, or anticipatory pain. Pain is a common problem for people living with HIV/AIDS. Self-reported pain is associated with cultural factors and changes in illness status. Clinicians' attention to patients' emotional distress, depression, and anxiety may assist in interventions for pain management."
9540,0.002,2.0,"Evidence of increasing prevalence of drug resistance among recent HIV seroconverters indicates a growing public health concern and warrants an examination of the problem from a prevention perspective. Among 638 HIV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) completing 2731 visits between December 1996 and February 2000 in an ongoing cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland, factors associated with unprotected sex and needle sharing were determined. Participants were classified as being at higher or lower risk of HIV and of drug-resistant HIV transmission based on viral load, antiretroviral therapy use, and reported high-risk behavior. Stored plasma of those at higher risk of drug-resistant HIV transmission was tested for resistance by VirtualPhenotype (Vircolab, Rockville, MD). Women were nearly twice as likely as men to engage in unprotected sex, and IDUs were more likely to have unprotected sex if their sexual partners were also HIV infected. IDUs were at higher risk of HIV and drug-resistant HIV transmission at 19% and 6% of all visits, respectively. Participants were infected with drug-resistant HIV at 14% of visits when they were at higher risk of HIV transmission. Intensive risk reduction counseling is needed and must be integrated into routine HIV clinical care."
4421,0.002,2.0,"It is estimated that approximately 3% of the world population are chronically infected with HCV, as the annual incidence of HCV infection is approximately 3-4 million people. Despite all efforts made to eradicate the HCV infection, after the standard therapy (PegIFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks) only 40-50% of the HCV infected individuals with genotype 1 achieve sustained virological response (SVR). Since our goal today is the eradication of HCV infection, our prior concern has become the identification of predictor factors concerning treatment response. Recent studies such as GWAS have been concerned with the genetic factors and the response to treatment. Recently all interest has been turned towards the demonstration of the host polymorphism located upstream of the IL-28B gene and which is associated with sustained virological response to treatment with pegylated interferon Alfa in combination with ribavirin. Although 2011 comes with the FDA approval of the new triple therapy associating telaprevir/ boceprevir to the standard therapy, a new ethical concern regarding the high costs of this treatment rises the problem of who is the first in line? This is just the beginning of a new quest to further investigate the relationship between the host's polymorphism of the IL-28 gene and the standard and triple therapy in HCV infected individuals in achieving SVR as well as who should receive standard or triple therapy. Determination of the IL-28 polymorphisms may be used together with clinical assessment in order to evaluate patients and to personalize their treatment. The purpose of this paper is to underline the main concerns regarding the goal and endpoints of the HCV therapy, and the relationship of IL-28 in achieving sustained virological response, as well as in pointing out the importance to determine prior to initiating treatment the polymorphism of IL-28 since it is a strong predictor. This is important because it will increase the chances to achieve SVR, it will be cost-effective and reduces adverse effects."
6657,0.002,2.0,"Sub-Saharan Africa is disproportionately burdened by intestinal helminth and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Recent evidence suggests detrimental immunologic effects from concomitant infection with the two pathogens. Few studies, however, have assessed the prevalence of and predictors for intestinal helminth infection among HIV-1-infected adults in urban African settings where HIV infection rates are highest. We collected and analyzed sociodemographic and parasitologic data from 297 HIV-1-infected adults (mean age = 31.1 years, 69% female) living in Lusaka, Zambia to assess the prevalence and associated predictors of helminth infection. We found at least one type of intestinal helminth in 24.9% of HIV-infected adults. Thirty-nine (52.7%) were infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, and 29 (39.2%) were infected with hookworm. More than 80% were light-intensity infections. A recent visit to a rural area, food shortage, and prior history of helminth infection were significant predictors of current helminth status. The high helminth prevalence and potential for adverse interactions between helminths and HIV suggests that helminth diagnosis and treatment should be part of routine HIV care."

Here, we discuss factors, including sexually transmitted diseases and hormonal contraceptive use, that impact susceptibility to HIV-1 in women in sub-Saharan Africa. This population is of special interest, given that women in this region are more likely to be infected than men. In addition, they are a potential source of transmission to their infants.

7037,0.002,2.0,"Mutations in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, previously shown to confer an enhanced replicative capacity and broadened host range to the ELI1 strain of HIV-1, were analyzed for their biochemical effects on envelope structure and function. The tendency of purified virions to release their extracellular gp120 component, either spontaneously or after interacting with soluble CD4 (CD4-induced shedding) was assessed. A single amino acid substitution in part of the CD4 binding site of gp120 (Gly-427 to Arg) enhanced both spontaneous and CD4-induced shedding of gp120 from virions, while a single change in the fusogenic region of gp41 (Met-7 to Val) affected only CD4-induced shedding. Although each codon change alone conferred increased growth ability, virus with both mutations exhibited the most rapid replication kinetics. In addition, when both of these mutations were present, virions had the highest tendency to shed gp120, both spontaneously and after exposure to soluble CD4. Analysis of CD4 binding to virion-associated gp120 showed that the changes in both gp120 and gp41 contributed to increased binding. These results demonstrated that the increased replicative capacity of the ELI variants in human CD4+ cell lines was associated with altered physical and functional properties of the virion envelope glycoproteins."
5454,0.002,2.0,"In the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era, the incidence of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADC) has increased and contributes to a growing proportion of mortality in the aging HIV-infected population. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of increased cancer risk are incompletely understood. Potential contributors include oncogenic effects of the HIV virus, immunosuppression, chronic inflammation and immune activation, exposure to HAART, higher rates of oncogenic viral coinfections and traditional cancer risk factors. HIV-infected patients often present with NADC at younger ages with more aggressive or advanced stage disease. However, when standard cancer therapy is given, treatment outcomes appear similar to the non-HIV population. These facts highlight the importance of clinicians' maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing age-appropriate screening, and optimizing cancer therapy. Development of novel strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of NADC will be required to reverse these epidemiologic trends and improve the survival of HIV-infected patients. "

8235,0.002,2.0,"The Tat protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a potent activator of long terminal repeat-directed transcription. While in most cell types, activation requires interaction of Tat with the unusual transcription element TAR, astrocytic glial cells support TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription by Tat. This alternative pathway of Tat activation is mediated by the viral enhancer, a kappa B domain capable of binding the prototypical form of the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) present in many cell types, including T lymphocytes. Tat transactivation mediated by the kappa B domain is sufficient to allow replication of TAR-deleted mutant HIV-1 in astrocytes. The present study demonstrates the existence of kappa B-specific binding factors present in human glial astrocytes that differ from prototypical NF-kappa B. The novel astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding activity is retained on an HIV-1 Tat affinity column, while prototypical NF-kappa B from Jurkat T cells is not. In vitro transcription studies demonstrate that astrocyte-derived kappa B-binding factors activate transcription of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat and that this activation is dependent on the kappa B domain. Moreover, TAR-independent transactivation of HIV-1 transcription is reproduced in vitro in an astrocyte factor-dependent manner which correlates with kappa B-binding activity. The importance of the central nervous system-enriched kappa B transcription factor in the regulation of HIV-1 expression is discussed."
7482,0.002,2.0,"The addition of 5-10% of fresh normal human serum (NHS) from normal individuals into a culture of primarily HIV-1-infected CD4+ leukemic T-cell lines CEM and MT4 was found to rescue the infected cells from cytopathic death, enabling the cells to achieve growth within 10 days. The HIV-1-infected cells cultured in ordinary medium with fetal calf serum (FCS) all died within 10 days. The effect of NHS was ascribed to human complement component factor B and one or more factor B-dependent heat-labile co-factors. The cells which survived in the presence of NHS rapidly lost surface expression of CD4 and became completely resistant to rechallenge by HIV-1. Viral genomes were dramatically reduced in surviving cells within 30 days, and one cell-line CEM completely expelled them during this period. The results suggest that factor B has protective and potential therapeutic significance in HIV-1 infection."
1269,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the brain produces a characteristic disease called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia in which productive infection and inflammatory activation of microglia and macrophages play a central role. In this report, the authors demonstrate that minocycline (MC), a second-generation tetracycline with proven safety and penetration to the central nervous system, potently inhibited viral production from microglia. Inhibition of viral release was sustained through the entire course of infection and even when the drug exposure was limited to the first day of infection. Minocycline was effective even at low viral doses, and against R5- and X4R5-HIV, as well as in single-cycle reporter virus assays. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis showed that minocycline inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in microglia. HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-promoter activity in U38 cells was also inhibited. These results, combined with recently demonstrated in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of MC on microglia, suggest a potential utility for MC as an effective adjunct therapy for AIDS dementia."
857,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system is associated with characteristic virological, clinical, and neuropathological findings in adults and children. Productive infection in the brain and spinal cord occurs in blood-derived macrophages, resident microglia, and multinucleated giant cells. Previous work implicated indirect mechanisms for neurotoxicity by HIV-1 gene products or by factors secreted from HIV-1--infected macrophages. However, this cannot explain the paradox between the small numbers of infected cells and the widespread tissue pathology. Based on recent studies from our laboratories, we suggest that HIV-1--infected macrophages can initiate neurotoxicity, which is then amplified through cell-to-cell interactions with astrocytes. Macrophage-astrocyte interactions produce cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta and arachidonic metabolites that cause astroglial proliferation and neuronal injury. Inevitably, the astrogliosis serves to amplify these cellular processes while brain infection maintains itself in macrophage and microglia and possibly in astrocytes (by restricted infection). These findings, taken together, provide fresh insights into how low numbers of productively infected cells could elicit progressive and devastating neurological impairment during HIV-1 disease, and suggest therapeutic strategies to interrupt the pathological process."

This study is the first report of prevalence of viral hepatitis and hepatitis C virus genotypes in southwest Iran among hemodialysis patients. A cross-sectional study was carried out among 214 hemodialysis patients of the Central hemodialysis unit, from March 2005 to August 2006. Serum samples were tested for HBsAg and anti-HCV using specific enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits and confirmed by PCR (HBV) and RT PCR (HCV). HCV genotypes were determined with HCV genotype specific primers using HCV genotype kit. Out of 214 hemodialysis patients, 34 were positive for anti-HCV (7.9%, 95% CI: 4.32-11.56) and 11 for HBsAg (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.18-8.1). The duration of treatment by hemo-dialysis was significantly associated with HBV and HCV positivity (P< 0.001). The predominant HCV genotype in the region was 1a (41.1%, 7/17), whilst genotypes 3a and 1b were found in 35.2% (6/17) and 23.5% (4/17) subjects, respectively. In conclusion although anti-HCV and HBsAg positivity in hemodialysis patients in Khuzestan province are smaller than those found in some other Iranian provinces and neighboring countries, they are still high. Enforcement of universal precautions in infection control, routine testing of patients, and serial determination of hepatic enzymes should be the common practice in dialysis centers in Iran."

In this prospective study, 394 subjects were enrolled and followed at 8-week intervals for a median of 21 months. During follow-up, 164 (42%) of 394 patients developed at least 1 bacterial infection. The most common infections were sinusitis, bacterial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, and bronchitis. Serious bacterial infections (defined as bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia, or deep visceral abscess) were reported by 56 subjects (14%). Female sex, age of <40 years, and Karnofsky score of < or =80 were independent risk factors for bacterial infections. Prophylaxis with clarithromycin, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, or both had significant protective effect. The occurrence of any confirmed bacterial infection was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality.

To determine the prevalence of occult B infection (OBI) in a population with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and management with universal prophylaxis (UP) in all patients undergoing chemoimmunotherapy or targeted prophylaxis (TP) in patients experiencing seroreversion during therapy, we analyzed 397 patients with CLL from our database. The prevalence of OBI in our patients with CLL was 8.6% (34 patients). When comparing patients with OBI/CLL with those with CLL, we did not find any statistical difference among clinical-biological parameters and time dependent endpoints except for a lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count in the OBI/CLL group (p = 0.036). From 2000 to 2010 careful follow-up and TP were adopted; two out of 10 patients (20%) showed seroreversion. From June 2010 we adopted UP during and 12 months after immunosuppressive treatment in all patients with CLL with OBI; no evidence of seroreversion was detected. "
3303,0.002,2.0,"The relevance of zinc in resistance to infections by virus, fungi and bacteria is recognized because of its pivotal role in the efficiency of the entire immune system, in particular in conferring biological activity to a thymic hormone called thymulin, which has differentiation properties on T-cell lines. In infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the zinc-bound form of thymulin (active thymulin, ZnFTS) is strongly reduced in stage IV of the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification) with concomitant decrements in CD4(+) cell count and zincemia values. The zinc-unbound form of thymulin (inactive thymulin, FTS) is, in contrast, very high. The in vitro addition of zinc to plasma samples induces a recovery of the thymulin active form, suggesting low zinc bioavailability as the cause of impaired thymic functions with consequent CD4(+) depletion. An analysis of risk factors for the incidence of recidivism opportunistic infections shows CD4(+) depletion and zinc deficiency to have significant scores. Supplementation with zinc for 1 mo (45 mg Zn(2+)/d) associated with zidovudine (AZT) therapy in stage IV induces recovery of active zinc-bound thymulin, of zincemia, of CD4(+) cells with concomitant reduction (50%) of recidivism opportunistic infections compared with the AZT-treated group. Complete disappearance of recidivism by Candida aesophagea or Pneumocystis carinii is observed after supplementation with zinc. The relative risk factors (CD4(+) depletion and zinc-deficiency) have lower scores in the HIV-positive zinc-treated group, confirming, as such, the relevance of zinc in opportunistic infections that involve extracellular matrix. Such an assumption is indirectly confirmed with new HAART, where no opportunistic infections occur. Indeed, HIV RNA is inversely correlated with both CD4(+) and zincemia values (r = -0.73, P<0.01) in HAART-treated subjects. Lower scores for the same relative factors for the appearance of opportunistic infections are present in HAART-treated subjects compared with those treated with AZT. These findings, on the one hand, show the poor efficacy of AZT therapy compared with HAART therapy for the progression of HIV, but on the other hand, they suggest that the lack of occurrence of opportunistic infections by HAART may also result from major zinc bioavailability. This further supports the key role played by zinc against opportunistic infections in HIV with a possible independent effect by either HIV or the pathogens involved."
4888,0.002,2.0,"Because the time from primary infection to symptoms in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is typically 8-10 years, the use of surrogate markers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic efficacy is of interest. An acid dissociation procedure that disrupts the p24 antigen-antibody complexes found in early HIV-1 infection has greatly increased the sensitivity of p24 detection assays. The utility of p24 antigen after acid treatment as a surrogate marker of disease progression and therapeutic effect in asymptomatic HIV-infected subjects receiving zidovudine (AZT) was determined. After acid treatment, the sensitivity of p24 antigen detection increased fivefold. The proportion of subjects who were antigenemic increased over the 48-week follow-up in the placebo group; approximately 50% of subjects who were p24 antigen-positive at entry and who received AZT showed clearance or a greater than 50% reduction in baseline p24 antigen levels at 16 and 32 weeks. Thus, acid treatment of plasma may allow the use of p24 antigen as a marker of disease progression and therapeutic response."
7926,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects target cells by binding to CD4 and a chemokine receptor, most commonly CCR5. CXCR4 is a frequent alternative coreceptor (CoR) in subtype B and D HIV-1 infection, but the importance of many other alternative CoRs remains elusive. We have analyzed HIV-1 envelope (Env) proteins from 66 individuals infected with the major subtypes of HIV-1 to determine if virus entry into highly permissive NP-2 cell lines expressing most known alternative CoRs differed by HIV-1 subtype. We also performed linear regression analysis to determine if virus entry via the major CoR CCR5 correlated with use of any alternative CoR and if this correlation differed by subtype. Virus pseudotyped with subtype B Env showed robust entry via CCR3 that was highly correlated with CCR5 entry efficiency. By contrast, viruses pseudotyped with subtype A and C Env proteins were able to use the recently described alternative CoR FPRL1 more efficiently than CCR3, and use of FPRL1 was correlated with CCR5 entry. Subtype D Env was unable to use either CCR3 or FPRL1 efficiently, a unique pattern of alternative CoR use. These results suggest that each subtype of circulating HIV-1 may be subject to somewhat different selective pressures for Env-mediated entry into target cells and suggest that CCR3 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtype B while FPRL1 may be used as a surrogate CoR by subtypes A and C. These data may provide insight into development of resistance to CCR5-targeted entry inhibitors and alternative entry pathways for each HIV-1 subtype."
6318,0.002,2.0,"Hepatocellular carcinoma associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection occurring in a boy who was 6 years 2 months old is reported. The patient is thought to have been infected with HBV by exchange blood transfusion (horizontal infection) in the neonatal period. Jaundice appeared eight months after birth. He was subsequently treated and follow-up with a diagnosis of hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen (Ag)-positive chronic persistent hepatitis. His mother and other family members were HBsAg-negative. Postmortem examination revealed a multinodular growth of hepatocellular carcinoma of trabecular and solid pattern, mainly of the right lobe, complicated with mild fibrosis of the liver. Numerous HBsAg-positive hepatocytes demonstrated by orcein staining and the indirect immunoperoxidase method were present in the noncancerous area. This hepatocellular carcinoma is considered to have occurred within six years two months after HBV infection and not to have been associated with liver cirrhosis. The present case may be valuable for assessing the oncogenic properties of HBV and the incubation period of HBV infection before it develops into hepatocellular carcinoma."
5060,0.002,2.0,"Recently, the assay system of anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV-Ab) was developed. However, there is no clinically useful method to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) itself. The authors recently developed a method to detect the HCV-RNA genome in plasma using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In the present study, the specificity of this assay in detecting HCV infection was investigated. Freshly obtained 1 ml plasma specimens from 100 patients with various liver diseases and from 11 control subjects were studied. In patients with non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis-related liver diseases, HCV-RNA was detected in 2 out of 7 cases of acute hepatitis, in 29 out of 31 cases of chronic hepatitis, in 17 out of 21 cases of cirrhosis and in 2 out of 6 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, no HCV-RNA was detected in 15 cases of various types of alcoholic liver diseases, in 12 cases of hepatitis B related liver diseases, and in 11 controls. HCV-RNA was detected in 2 of 6 drinkers with chronic hepatitis. The prevalence of HCV-RNA was not closely related to a history of blood transfusions. These results suggest that our method for HCV-RNA is specific for HCV infection and HCV infection is the likely etiology of most chronic NANB hepatitis cases. The clinical usefulness of our method is illustrated by the fact that we were able to study 100 patients and needed only 1 ml plasma per HCV-RNA assay."
7670,0.002,2.0,"Among many mutational ""hot spots"" on hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, A-to-T1762 and G-to-A1764 within the core promoter have been underscored in view of disease association as well as viral expression/replication. Although to a lesser extent, C-to-T1653 and T-to-V(C/A/G)1753 were also noteworthy in our previous study. To assess the clinical significance of these mutations, we determined the nucleotide sequence of an HBV DNA fragment covering these sites in HBsAg-positive blood donors (n = 160) and patients with chronic hepatitis (n = 66), liver cirrhosis (n = 45), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 58), most of whom were infected with genotype C HBV (subtype adr). In cases where HBe antigen was positive, the frequency of T1653 and/or V1753 showed a striking increment from chronic hepatitis patients (18%) to liver cirrhosis and/or hepatoma patients (82%), whereas that of T1762/A1764 was already high in chronic hepatitis patients (76%). In HBe antigen-negative cases, by contrast, significant difference in the frequency of T1653/V1753 mutants was found between blood donors (22%) and chronic hepatitis patients (67%). Our results suggest that T1653/V(particularly C)1753 mutants are more closely associated than T1762/A1764 with the progression of liver disease from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis in HBe antigen-positive patients. A system of site-directed mutagenesis PCR RFLP was constructed to diagnose T1653 and C/A1753 more conveniently. Detecting T1653 and C/A1753 by this method would contribute to the differential diagnosis of HBV-associated liver disease."
3205,0.002,2.0,"The factors determining the responsiveness of different hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes to interferon treatment are not fully understood. We investigated the relationship between HBV genetic characteristics and the outcome of short (16 weeks) or prolonged (32 weeks) treatment with standard interferon-alpha in a prospectively followed cohort of 103 patients across Europe with HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B. INNO-LiPA assays and HBV DNA sequencing were used to determine HBV genotypes, mutations in the core promoter and precore/core regions. After 16-weeks interferon-alpha treatment, the rate of HBeAg clearance was higher in genotype A versus all other genotypes (P = 0.014), or genotype D alone (P = 0.05). The HBV genome analysis revealed that: (i) after 16-weeks treatment, an HBV subpopulation with core promoter mutations emerged or increased (P < 0.001) only in genotype A; (ii) the core gene of genotype A has the lowest number of amino acid variations in comparison with genotypes B, C, or D. Logistic regression analysis identified genotype A as a positive predictor of short (16 weeks) treatment response (P = 0.001; odds ratio 6.19, 95 confidence interval 1.94-19.8), having a greater impact than baseline HBV DNA or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In contrast, the response to prolonged interferon-alpha treatment was not different between HBV genotypes. These results suggest that HBV genotype A responds earlier to interferon treatment than other genotypes, which is associated with its molecular characteristics. The optimal duration of interferon-based therapies in chronic hepatitis B may vary between different HBV genotypes."
6374,0.002,2.0,"Anemia in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients can have serious implications, which vary from functional and quality-of-life decrements to an association with disease progression and decreased survival. In 2002, 16 members of the Anemia in HIV Working Group, an expert panel of physicians involved in the care of HIV-infected patients that met first in 1998, reconvened to assess new data and to translate these data into evidence-based treatment guidelines. The group reached consensus on the prevalence of anemia in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era; the risk factors that are independently associated with the development of anemia; the impact of anemia on quality of life, physical functioning, and survival; the impact of the treatment of hepatitis C virus coinfection on anemia in HIV-infected patients; evidence-based guidelines for treatment of anemia in HIV-infected patients, including the therapeutic role of epoetin alfa; and directions for future research."
2297,0.002,2.0,"We have analyzed the transcriptional activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) LTR promoter in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S.pombe). The ability of a series of 5'-deleted forms of the HIV-1 LTR promoter to direct transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was studied. We found that the HIV-1 promoter is functional in S.pombe and that deletion of sequences upstream of the NF-kB binding site previously identified to contain the negative regulatory element (NRE) in mammalian cells, resulted in about thirty-fold increase in transcriptional activity. Sequences in the HIV-1 promoter that bind NF-kB were found to be essential for transcriptional activation in S.pombe. In mammalian cells, transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR requires TAR sequences and the viral Tat protein. In fission yeast, Tat failed to transactivate the HIV-1 LTR, suggesting that S.pombe may lack a cellular factor(s) required for the Tat transactivation process."
9957,0.002,2.0,"Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as an increasingly important pathogen, causing infections in persons who have no significant healthcare exposures. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been disproportionately affected by CA-MRSA, with increased colonization and infection documented. Several factors are likely involved in the increased CA-MRSA burden observed among HIV-infected patients, including immune factors as well as healthcare and community exposures. Proposed community exposures that have been associated with increased CA-MRSA risk include substance abuse, incarceration, geographic area of residence, and social networks. This article explores these associations and reviews the current knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of CA-MRSA in HIV-infected persons. "
431,0.002,2.0,"Human adenovirus E1A oncoprotein activates or represses transcription from a variety of viral and cellular promoters by several complex mechanisms. The E1A products, 289R and 243R, have differential effects on transcription directed by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR). Previous reports indicate that repression of HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression by E1A 243R is mediated through the kappa B enhancer elements located between nucleotides -105 and -82 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1). Results from this study suggest a novel mechanism for transcriptional repression of the HIV-1 LTR by E1A 243R that is enhancer-independent and that is mediated through basal HIV-1 promoter elements. Transient expression assays, in which 5'-truncated or site-directed mutant HIV-1 LTR-CAT reporters were tested for their response to repression mediated by wild-type or mutant 243R, demonstrate that LTR sequences upstream of -31 relative to the transcription initiation start site (+1) and inclusive of the enhancer elements are dispensable for 243R-mediated repression. The ability of 243R to repress HIV-1 basal promoter activity requires both an intact N-terminus of E1A 243R and the TATA element within the HIV-1 promoter. These results support a novel mechanism for E1A 243R-induced transcriptional repression that is enhancer-independent and that targets directly the general transcription machinery."
8191,0.002,2.0,"In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) latently infected cells, NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a critical role in the transcriptional induction of the HIV-1 promoter. The trans-activating ability of NF-kappaB can be modified by another nuclear factor C/EBPbeta that can physically bind to NF-kappaB and regulate its activity. Because the HIV-1 promoter also contains a C/EBPbeta site adjacent to the NF-kappaB site, the present study examined cooperative functional in vivo interaction of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta, and the impact of Tat in this event. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of p65 along with Tat increases p65 binding to HIV-1 LTR, and that this increase correlates with enhanced HIV-1 promoter activity. Further, co-expression of C/EBPbeta and Tat leads to a decrease in p65 binding, which allows C/EBPbeta to bind more efficiently to the LTR. Inhibition of p65 expression by siRNA significantly decreases C/EBPbeta-binding and LTR expression. Using ChIP assay, we confirmed the existence of an interchange between p65 and C/EBPbeta and their abilities to bind to the LTR in vivo. These observations demonstrate that a delicate balance of interaction between p65, C/EBPbeta, and Tat can dictate the level of HIV-1 LTR transcription."
6576,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have identified gaps in hepatitis B care. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the delivery of care among a national cohort of US veterans with chronic hepatitis B infection and examine risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from 1999 to 2013 to evaluate (1) care delivery and (2) clinical outcomes such as hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic decompensation, and mortality among US veterans with hepatitis B. Incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated and Cox regression models were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. We identified 21,419 veterans with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen, and 97% of patients had alanine aminotransferase and 44% had hepatitis B virus DNA testing; hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis B e antibody were tested <50% of the time. Patients receiving specialty care had a higher prevalence of recommended laboratory testing. Patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase in specialty care were more likely to receive antiviral therapy (50% versus 24% for specialty care versus no specialty care, P < 0.001). Among patients with cirrhosis, 69% received one-time liver imaging. The proportion of follow-up time adherent to annual imaging was 0.39 (standard deviation = 0.42), and the proportion was 0.28 (standard deviation = 0.33) for biannual imaging; both proportions were higher in the specialty care group (all P < 0.05). Antiviral therapy (hazard ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.95, P = 0.005) and liver imaging (hazard ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.76-0.91, P < 0.001) were independently associated with decreased mortality in adjusted analyses."
6710,0.002,2.0,"The last international consensus conference about hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment emphasized the importance of treatment for persons coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As liver biopsy precedes treatment, we aimed to identify factors associated with the performance of liver biopsy among HIV-HCV coinfected drug users during a 5-year follow-up to study their access to HCV treatment. Of the 296 patients followed in the HIV hospital departments of Nice and Marseilles and with retrievable records about HCV diagnosis and care, 166 were eligible for analysis having had detectable HCV RNA at least once during the study period. Overall, 45.2% of patients underwent liver biopsy during follow-up. Using proportional hazard models, predictors of having had a liver biopsy were high social support, complete abstinence from drug injection, and lack of immunosuppression as well as male gender, no history of multiple incarcerations, more recent onset of drug use, and an increase of liver enzyme levels. These results suggest that specific efforts should be devoted to HIV-HCV coinfected drug users to assist with stabilizing these patients to optimize their access to HCV care whenever possible."
7874,0.002,2.0,"The Caribbean has the highest adult HIV prevalence in the world after sub-Saharan Africa (2011). One sub-population in the Dominican Republic is the migratory Batey community primarily comprised of Haitian immigrants with limited access to healthcare and HIV prevalence rates of between 3.0% and 9.0%, compared to 0.7% nationally. This retrospective cohort study describes the cumulative retention from diagnosis to virological suppression for newly-diagnosed HIV-infected adults presenting to the Clínica de Familia and its Batey programme in La Romana, during 2011. Of the patients diagnosed with HIV, 65% entered into care, 59% completed immunologic testing, 53% were eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, 36% initiated ART within three months of eligibility and 27% were retained in care. Seventeen per cent of those retained on ART with a 12-month viral load measure had undetectable viral load. Attrition primarily occurred before ART initiation. The Batey programme had a first step lost-to-follow-up of 88% compared to 20% at the clinic (p < 0.001). This retrospective study details the continuum of care and indicates where structural changes must occur to increase continuity between steps. The manuscript results are important to help implement programmes to enhance engagement and retention in HIV primary care. "
3046,0.002,2.0,"Intensive care unit (ICU) survival has been improved significantly for HIV-infected patients since the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Non-AIDS conditions account for the majority of ICU admission diagnoses in areas with access to ART. However, opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia still account for a significant proportion of ICU admissions, particularly in newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients, and are associated with increased ICU mortality. We discuss risk factors and outcomes for HIV-infected admitted to the ICU in the current ART era. We review the changing patterns in ICU admission diagnoses over time and how common ICU conditions are managed in HIV-infected compared with uninfected patients. We next address issues specific to the care for HIV-infected patients in the ICU, focusing on immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, ART continuation or initiation, and some common and potentially life-threatening ART-associated toxicities. "
8151,0.002,2.0,"Current drugs used for antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a narrow spectrum of activity and, more often, have associated toxicities and severe side effects in addition to developing resistance. Thus, there is a need to develop new therapeutic strategies against HIV/AIDS to complement the already existing ones. Surprisingly, transactivator of transcription (Tat), an early virus-encoded protein required for the efficient transcription of the HIV genome, has not been developed as a target for small molecular therapeutics. We have previously described the ability of an endogenous Michael acceptor electrophile (MAE), 15-deoxy-Δ(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)), to inhibit Tat-dependent transcription by targeting its cysteine (Cys)-rich domain. In an effort to identify other MAEs possessing inhibitory activity against HIV-1 Tat, we tested a collection of plant-derived compounds with electrophilic properties, including curcumin, rosmarinic acid, and gambogic acid, for their ability to inhibit Tat. Celastrol (Cel), a triterpenoid MAE isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii, exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against Tat. Using biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that Cel, by covalently modifying the cysteine thiols, inhibits Tat transactivation function. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that alkylation of Tat brought about a change in the secondary structure of Tat, which inhibited the transcription elongation of the HIV proviral genome by effecting mechanisms other than Tat-TAR (transactivation-responsive region) interaction. Our results demonstrate the underlying mechanism of antiretroviral activity of the plant-derived MAEs and suggest that Cel could serve as a lead compound to develop novel antiviral therapeutics."

6737,0.002,2.0,"The Tat protein of HIV is produced early after infection and it is essential for viral replication and transmission. Tat is released by infected lymphocytes and is detected in the serum of HIV-infected patients. Extracellular Tat enters cells, where promotes HIV replication. Several studies suggest that humoral and cellular anti-Tat immunity have a protective role and may control disease progression. Of importance, Tat is conserved in its immunogenic regions among all viral subtypes except O subtype. Thus, the immunization with Tat cannot block virus entry but might block HIV replication and progression to disease. To test this hypothesis, monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were immunized with a biologically active Tat protein. Tat was non toxic and induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses. High titers of anti-Tat antibodies capable of neutralizing Tat activity and the in vitro infection with the SHIV89.6P, Tat-specific proliferation, CTLs, TNFalpha production and skin tests were detected in the vaccinated monkeys. Most importantly, upon challenge with the highly pathogenic SHIV89.6P (10 MID50, i.v.), 5/7 of the vaccinated monkeys showed no signs of infection nor CD4+-T cell decline over a 19 months of follow-up, whereas 3/3 controls were highly infected. Thus, a Tat-vaccine is capable of controlling the acute phase of infection in nonhuman primates. These data open new avenues for the development of an AIDS vaccine."
1955,0.002,2.0,"An important unresolved clinical issue is to distinguish hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection caused chronic hepatitis and their corresponding liver cirrhosis (LC). Recent research suggests that circulating microRNAs are useful biomarkers for a wide array of diseases. We analyzed microRNA profiles in the plasmas of a total of 495 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, LC patients and healthy donors and identified 10 miRNAs that were differentially expressed between CHB and LC patients. Our logistic models show that three panels of miRNAs have promising diagnostic performances in discriminating CHB from LC. Blinded tests were subsequently conducted to evaluate the diagnostic performances in clinical practice and a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 70% have been achieved in separating CHB from LC pateints. The expression levels of some circulating miRNAs were significantly correlated with HBV DNA load and liver function, such as prothrombin activity (PTA) and levels of alanin aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB) and cholinesterase (CHE). Our results provide important information for developing novel diagnostic tools for distinguishing chronic HBV hepatitis and their corresponding cirrhosis. "
8563,0.002,2.0,"Worldwide, more than one million children are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and in the United States it has become the sixth leading cause of death among 15-24-year-olds. Despite the trend of increasing rates of infection, advances in therapies have led to survival past 5 years of age for more than 65% of infected children. This global health threat will therefore continue to have a significant impact on child and adolescent psychiatry and psychology. This paper reviews current studies and reports on the consequences of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the psychiatric care and development of children and adolescents infected by HIV. From a search of all the English-language-based literature on pediatric AIDS, 140 studies are reviewed which address HIV infection and its psychological and social implications. Several topics of mental health significance are examined: (1) the epidemiology of HIV, (2) neurocognitive development among those infected, (3) psychological impact of infection, and (4) the family and social context of HIV. The transition of HIV from an acute, lethal disease to a subacute, chronic disease has enormous implications for the neurocognitive and psychosocial development of children and families. As children and adolescents infected with HIV continue to live longer, normal developmental milestones and educational needs will take on new significance. Many children will continue to be adversely impacted by non-HIV factors such as poverty, inadequate medical services, and a lack of social support. This review outlines recent developments that hold promise to effectively reduce the treatment burden on the infected, their families, and health care providers and to decrease the incidence of transmission to the uninfected."
5059,0.002,2.0,"The chronic stage of HIV-1 infection has been extensively described as a slowly evolving phase, in which the virus induces T-cell death slightly faster than the human body is able to recover. In contrast, T-cell and viral replication dynamics during primary infection have been less well studied. Recent studies in the SIV-macaque model and in HIV-positive patients during the acute infection period have highlighted the massive and irreversible depletion of CD4 memory T cells in the mucosa, particularly in the gut. Hence, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) plays a central role in the early stages of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Due to its particular cytokine expression pattern, GALT may favour the differential replication of certain HIV-1 subtypes during primary infection, particularly of subtype C. This could enhance the chance of a successful transmission. Moreover, these early events taking place in GALT during primary infection have major implications for therapy and vaccine design."
8273,0.002,2.0,"To determine the compliance and tolerance with zidovudine (azidothymidine or AZT) therapy among poor, minority, and intravenous drug-using patients, data were collected on all AIDS and ARC patients followed for at least 4 weeks in a New York City Human Immunodeficiency Virus clinic. Ninety-nine patients received zidovudine, of whom 75% were males, 92% were minorities, and 59% had a history of intravenous drug use. Of the 99 patients, 72 had AIDS and 27 had ARC with T-helper (CD4) lymphocytes less than or equal to 500 mm3. Eighty-seven of the 99 patients (88%) were compliant with zidovudine therapy. Fifty-seven percent of these had at least one adverse drug reaction requiring dose reduction (44%) or cessation (13%). Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in other populations with HIV-related illness, although headache and nausea were less common. Twenty opportunistic infections (OIs) or HIV-related malignancies occurred in 15 of 82 (18%) patients who were on zidovudine for at least 4 weeks (7.6 OIs/1,000 patient weeks). Seven of the 82 died (9%), compared to 9 of the 17 patients (53%) who did not complete 4 weeks of zidovudine therapy (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in any of these measures when intravenous drug users were compared with other risk groups. We conclude that zidovudine can be administered to intravenous drug users and others in an inner city clinic with acceptable compliance and tolerance."
4002,0.002,2.0,"Despite widely available and effective treatments, there are racial/ethnic disparities in HIV-related mortality rates. The reason for inadequate HIV/AIDS management among minority populations is not fully understood, however recent research indicates that patients rate the quality of their health care higher if they are racially/ethnically concordant with their providers. As trust plays prominently on health care ratings, we examined whether racial/ethnicity concordance was associated with two dimensions of trust, trust in the provider and mistrust in the health care system, in 380 HIV infected people New York City. In this sample, concordance was associated with lower mistrust in the health care system, but not with trust in provider. We conclude that in this patient population and within the health care system available to them, racial/ethnic concordance might be more important for helping patients to understand and navigate the health care system rather than in interpersonal relationships with a single provider."
3122,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with several renal syndromes including acute and chronic renal failures, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. HIV and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) share numerous biological and pathological features, including renal alterations. We investigated and compared the morphological changes of renal tissue of 51 experimentally and 21 naturally infected cats. Compared to the latter, the experimentally infected cats exhibited some mesangial widening and glomerulonephritis, milder proteinuria, and lower tubular and interstitial alterations. The numbers of giant protein tubular casts and tubular microcysts were also lower. In contrast, diffuse interstitial infiltrates and glomerular and interstitial amyloidosis were detected only in naturally infected cats. Similar alterations are found in HIV infected patients, thus supporting the idea of a causative role of FIV infection in renal disease, and underlining the relevance of the FIV and its natural host as an animal model for investigating lentivirus-associated nephropathy."
2525,0.002,2.0,"To estimate the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed coinfections among HIV, HBV, and HCV infected patients.

Serological data including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e-antibody (anti-HBe), antibodies to HIV and HCV, anti-toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM antibodies, and anti-syphilis antibodies (VDRL) were collected. We obtained data for 628 (218 HCV, 268 HBV, and 142 HIV) patients. Male-to-female ratios were 1:1 for HCV, 3:4 for HBV, and 5:3 for HIV. Age means (SD) were 54.24 (16.40), 44.53 (18.83), and 40.39 (15.92) years for HCV, HBV, and HIV, respectively. In HIV group, the prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfections was 8.5% and 2.8%, respectively. In HBV group, the prevalence of HCV and HIV coinfections was 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively. In HCV group, HIV or HBV coinfections occurred at the same frequency (1.4%). An absence of screening for coinfections was detected in 7.0-48.5% patients as per the group and the infectious agent; which represents an estimated proportion of 20 out of 1,000 patients with an undiagnosed coinfection. Despite a relatively low prevalence of coinfections, a significant proportion of cases remain undiagnosed because of a lack of systematic screening. J. Med.

This consisted of formative (35 MSM) and cross-sectional (600 MSM) studies at 72 sites, including 75 transvestites, 55 bisexuals, 10 sex workers, and 460 other MSM. Only 5.3% cohabited with a wife/girlfriend, but 30% reported ever having sex with a female. Prevalence of HIV was 8%, ranging from 33% in sex workers to 7% among transvestites and other MSM. Injecting drugs, selling sex, being 20-40 years old, having less than 6 years of education, and having more than five male anal sex partners in the past month were associated with being HIV-infected. MSM are an HIV bridge group, and should be included in sentinel surveillance. Targeted interventions should be implemented."
4577,0.002,2.0,"To investigate the pathogenicity of a virus originating in a chimpanzee with AIDS (C499), two chimpanzees were inoculated with a plasma-derived isolate termed human immunodeficiency virus type 1(NC) (HIV-1(NC)). A previously uninfected chimpanzee, C534, experienced rapid peripheral CD4(+) T-cell loss to fewer than 26 cells/microl by 14 weeks after infection. CD4(+) T-cell depletion was associated with high plasma HIV-1 loads but a low virus burden in the peripheral lymph node. The second chimpanzee, C459, infected 13 years previously with HIV-1(LAV), experienced a more protracted course of peripheral CD4(+) T-cell loss after HIV-1(NC) inoculation, resulting in fewer than 200 cells/microl by 96 weeks postinoculation. The quantities of viral RNA in the plasma and peripheral lymph node from C459 were below the lower limits of detection prior to inoculation with HIV-1(NC) but were significantly and persistently increased after superinfection, with HIV-1(NC) representing the predominant viral genotype. These results show that viruses derived from C499 are more pathogenic for chimpanzees than any other HIV-1 isolates described to date."
2454,0.002,2.0,"A number of infected individuals develop neuropathological disorders, such as AIDS dementia complex (ADC), as a consequence of HIV/AIDS. The biological features governing HIV entry and tropism in different brain cell types remain unclear, as do the genetics of the virus regulating these events and the neuropathogenic processes within the brain tissues. HIV-1 was isolated from the right and left parietal, occipital, and frontal lobes of the brain cortex of three HIV-1-infected patients: two with ADC and one without. The viral strains were studied from the innate tissues and various primary cell cultures. The kinetics and tropism of viral strains from different brain regions showed clear differences on various primary cell types (monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and T cells), which could discriminate between biological behavior of HIV-1 strains from patients with and without ADC. The variable effect of different donor cells on tropism was also clearly evident. The majority (with a few exceptions) of isolates from different brain regions of all three patients used CCR5 as coreceptor for entry. The consistent CCR5 use, macrophage tropism, and non-syncytium-inducing phenotype were the main characteristics of the brain-derived HIV-1 strains from all three patients. Importantly, viral strains derived directly from innate brain tissue of the patient without ADC showed some differences from the cultured variants of the same patient, whereas those from brain tissue of the patients with ADC were more similar to the culture-adapted strains. This suggests that the emergence of primary cell type-adapted isolates during ADC may play a crucial role in the development and progression of the neuropathology associated with ADC. The different genotypes residing in different areas of brain combined with their differential tropism and coreceptor use suggest that neurotropic variants exist that may be governing the neurological manifestation of HIV disease in infected patients."

28,0.002,2.0,"The incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been declining thanks to the universal hepatitis B infant immunization program. Nevertheless, young adults born before the program implementation might have acquired HBV in early childhood or remain susceptible to infection. This study aimed to evaluate hepatitis B epidemiology in asymptomatic young adult population in Ternate, eastern Indonesia. Serum samples of 376 subjects (aged 17-25, mean 19.82 ± 1.69 years; male/female 138/238) were screened for HBV parameters serologically (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]; its antibody [anti-HBs]; anti-core antigen [anti-HBc]), and molecularly (HBV DNA). HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA prevalence were 15.7%, 36.2%, 24.2%, and 27.9%, respectively, with male predominance. Of all subjects, 13.0% were HBsAg negative with detectable HBV DNA (occult hepatitis B [OHB]), and 56.4% showed negativity for all seromarkers. This population showed high hepatitis B prevalence with substantial occurrence of OHB. However, a high percentage of the population were still susceptible and at risk of HBV infection. This study emphasizes the necessity to improve prevention strategies to screen and manage HBV carriers, including the adoption of catch-up or booster vaccination targeted to young adult populations. Investigations on the roles of host-virus interactions associated with OHB and its implications are warranted. "
677,0.002,2.0,"Triple combinations of antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs are the standard treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but the challenges include long-term side effects, high costs, and adherence. The recent advent of potent and well-tolerated ART has renewed the interest for newer ART strategies. A dual regimen with the combination of dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV), two well-tolerated, metabolic-friendly, and potent drugs could offer additional benefits. Areas covered: A review of recent randomized trials and observational cohorts concerning the use of a dual therapy with DTG plus RPV as a switching strategy in patients with viral suppression. Expert commentary: Currently, data of more of 900 patients switched to this dual regimen are available. This combination shows a high rate of virological suppression, above 90% at 48 weeks, few discontinuations due to adverse events, improvement in bone and kidney parameters for patients discontinuing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lack of loss of the inflammatory control achieved with triple therapy, and a neutral effect on lipid parameters. Thus, for the first time, a dual regimen without protease inhibitors is effective, avoiding metabolic side effects and drug interactions. Longer follow-up is needed, but this dual regimen appears as a promising strategy for aging HIV-infected patients."
5512,0.002,2.0,"Non-A, non-B viral hepatitis was transmitted to four colony-born chimpanzees by infusion of three lots of antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) implicated in the transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis to two human recipients. All four inoculated animals showed histopathological evidence of viral hepatitis, and all demonstrated significant ALT elevations between seven and one-half weeks after inoculation. Acute-phase plasma from one of the infected chimpanzees (no. 771) was shown to induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in two other chimpanzees approximately three weeks after their inoculation. In addition, an acute-phase open liver wedge biopsy obtained from animal no. 771 was processed and examined by immune electron microscopy (IEM) for virus-like particles with convalescent serum from a serologically confirmed case of non-A, non-B hepatitis. Twenty-five to 30 nm (mean = 27 nm) diameter virus-like particles that were either ""full"" or ""empty"" were identified in this liver preparation by IEM. Two additional chimpanzees inoculated with a cesium chloride gradient fraction of an isopycnically banded liver homogenate (animal no. 771) also developed elevated ALT activity two to two and one-half weeks later. Our findings have experimentally verified that commercially produced factor VIII materials can induce non-A, non-B hepatitis in champanzees and that the disease can be subpassaged in these animals by inoculation of either acute-phase plasma or liver. These results also provide evidence for the association of 27 nm-diameter virus-like particles with non-A, non-B viral hepatitis."
5644,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C viral (HCV) kinetics after initiation of interferon-based therapy provide valuable insights for understanding virus pathogenesis, evaluating treatment antiviral effectiveness and predicting treatment outcome. Adverse effects of liver fibrosis and steatosis on sustained virological response have been frequently reported, yet their impacts on the early viral kinetics remain unclear. In this study, associations between histology status and early viral kinetics were assessed in 149 HCV genotype 1-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (DITTO trial). In multivariate analyses adjusted for critical factors such as IL28B genotype and baseline viral load, presence of significant fibrosis (Ishak stage > 2) was found to independently reduce the odds of achieving an initial reduction (calculated from day 0 to day 4) in HCV RNA of ≥2 logIU/mL (adjusted OR 0.03, P = 0.004) but was not associated with the second-phase slope of viral decline (calculated from day 8 to day 29). On the contrary, presence of liver steatosis was an independent risk factor for not having a rapid second-phase slope, that is, ≥0.3 logIU/mL/week (adjusted OR 0.22, P = 0.012) but was not associated with the first-phase decline. Viral kinetic modelling theory suggests that significant fibrosis primarily impairs the treatment antiviral effectiveness in blocking viral production by infected cells, whereas the presence of steatosis is associated with a lower net loss of infected cells. Further studies will be necessary to identify the biological mechanisms underlain by these findings."

To measure health impact, we enrolled clients from an intervention hospital and comparison hospital, and then conducted a baseline survey, and 7 bi-weekly home visits. We enrolled 405 intervention group clients and 344 comparison clients. Intervention clients were more likely than comparison clients to have detectable chlorine in stored water (40% vs. 1%, p<0.001), soap (51% vs. 36%, p<0.001), and a BCP water container (65% vs. 0%, p<0.001) at every home visit. Intervention clients were less likely than comparison clients to report illness (44% vs. 67%, p<0.001) or health facility visits for illness (74% vs. 95%, p<0.001), and had lower median illness scores (1.0 vs. 3.0, p<0.05).

1476,0.002,2.0,"In the early 1990s, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection associated with possible reuse of syringes and needles was reported among children in Romanian orphanages. These findings led health-care workers to use new disposable syringes and needles for administering injections. Bythe late 1990s, reports suggested that new disposable syringes and needles had become standard for all injections. However, surveillance data collected by the Romanian Ministry of Health (MoH) during 1997-1998 indicated that acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was associated with receiving injections among children aged <5 years. In Romania, injection frequently is used to administer medication, and nurses administer most injections. To identify the practices that might have resulted in injection-associated HBV transmission, selected clinic and hospital nurses were surveyed. This report summarizes the findings of the survey, which indicated that although nurses used new disposable syringes and needles, other inadequate infection-control practices might explain injection-associated HBV transmission. Results of the survey were used by the Romanian Coalition to Prevent Nosocomial Infections to prepare standards for injection safety to protect patients and health-care workers from HBV infection."

2276,0.002,2.0,"Prevalence and determinants of HIV infection were assessed in 127 homosexual and bisexual men in the northeastern part of Italy. The overall prevalence of HIV seropositivity was still rather low: 20% (95% confidence interval -CI- 13-27%). The most important risk factor for acquiring HIV infection turned out to be having has sexual intercourses in high-risk areas. Relative risks (RRs) for those who have travelled and had sex in North Europe and in the U.S., were, respectively, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.0-7.3) and 5.6 (95% CI: 1.2-25.9). A significantly increased risk was also seen for having a steady sexual partner (RR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.3-7.5). Use of nitrite inhalants, high number of occasional sexual partners and habitual receptive anal intercourses were also associated with elevation of risk, whereas prostitution was not. The present study confirms the patterns of HIV spread among homosexual and bisexual men from high-risk areas to low-risk areas and prompts urgent educational intervention, in order to prevent the epidemics of AIDS among Italian homosexuals from reaching the size documented in other countries."

As with other parts of the world, the HIV epidemic in Asia impacts mainly on men who have sex with men, one of the at-risk populations for sexually transmitted viral hepatitis. With the increasing availability of effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-related mortality of people living with HIV has markedly reduced. Liver disease has become an important cause of mortality and morbidity in the HIV-infected population. With the improvement of socioeconomic conditions and availability of healthcare in Asian countries in recent years, the epidemiology of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis among HIV-positive men who have sex with men has also evolved. This review updates the epidemiology of different types of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis in this defined population in Asia. "
9833,0.002,2.0,"Stromal-derived factor (SDF-1) is the principal ligand for CXCR4, a co-receptor with CD4 for T lymphocyte cell line-tropic human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). A common polymorphism, SDF1-3' A, was identified in an evolutionary conserved segment of the 3' untranslated region of the SDF-1 gene. Sequence analysis revealed a common variant at position 801, a G-->A transition referred to as SDF1-3' A. Because this variant eliminates the Msp I restriction site PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was used for rapid detection of genotypes. We genotyped 62 HIV infected patients and 60 non-HIV blood donors by RFLP analysis. We also assessed syncytia formation through co-culture of MT-2 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV patients. Syncytium-inducing HIV-1 variants have been shown to be clinically significant in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. In our study, we detected a low frequency of 3'A/3'A (5%) in the blood donors but this genotype was absent in all HIV patients. We found that 41 (68%) HIV patients including syncytia inducing (SI) and non-syncytia inducing (NSI) groups contained the wild type (wt/wt) genotype for SDF-1. Our data indicate that there is no correlation between SDF-1 alleles and syncytium inducing HIV."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality and has transformed HIV disease into a chronic, manageable condition. As a result, non-AIDS-related illnesses, including cardiovascular diseases, are now the leading causes of death in the HIV-infected population. Optimizing fasting lipid parameters plays an important role in reducing cardiovascular risk in this population. This review focuses on the management of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals treated with combination ART. "
7996,0.002,2.0,"The validity of self-report of drug use has been found to vary widely. Moreover, previous research has focused on samples of adults. In 1996-1998, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents and high-risk, noninfected adolescents (n = 182) were recruited at 16 locations in 13 US cities into the Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) project, to the authors' knowledge, the first national study of disease progression among HIV-positive adolescents who were infected through sexual behavior or injection drug use. Self-report of marijuana use was assessed through audio computer-assisted self-administered interviewing (ACASI). Urines were tested for marijuana at a certified laboratory by using the enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique. Conditional kappas for 2-, 5-, and 7-day self-reports were 0.57, 0.71, and 0.69, respectively. Maximum sensitivity was obtained from a combination of ACASI and urine drug testing. Contrary to previous studies, the data suggest that if a single evaluative instrument is to be used for prevalence, ACASI is more sensitive than urine drug testing for marijuana overall, but particularly for HIV-infected adolescents."

The sample consisted of 248 HIV/HCV co-infected patients (18-74 years, 81.5 % male) and 482 patients only with HIV (24-78 years, 62.7 % male). Participants completed the WHOQOL-HIV-Bref questionnaire and the Brief Symptom Inventory. The HIV/HCV co-infected patients reported significantly lower QoL in all domains, as well as significantly lower scores in 10 of the 17 specific facets. Overall, among the co-infected patients, male gender, employment, combination antiretroviral therapy use and fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with higher QoL. Symptoms of psychological distress accounted for significant variability in the QoL scores of co-infected patients. These data reinforce the need for tailored interventions to improve the overall well-being of HIV/HCV co-infected patients."
8122,0.002,2.0,"This research describes major stressors in the lives of women who have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thirty-one HIV antibody positive (HIV+) women infected primarily through heterosexual contact participated in a two hour semi-structured interview detailing the circumstances, context, and consequences of all stressful life events and difficulties experienced within the preceding six months. Qualitative methods of data analyses were utilized (Miles & Huberman, 1984). HIV-related life events and difficulties were classified into primary and secondary stressors based on the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1981). Problems arising directly from one's seropositivity were defined as primary stressors. Stressful life events and difficulties occurring in other role areas were defined as secondary stressors. Six categories of HIV-related stressors were identified and quantified. Primary stressors were health-related, and included both gynecological problems (e.g., amenorrhea) and general symptoms of HIV infection (e.g., fatigue). Secondary stressors related to child and family (e.g., future guardianship of children), marital/partner relations (e.g., disclosure of HIV+ status), occupation (e.g., arranging time-off for medical appointments), economic problems (e.g., insurance ""hassles""), and social network events (e.g., death of friends from AIDS). This research indicates that HIV-positive women are exposed to multiple stressors; some may be viewed as unique to women, whereas others may be considered common to both sexes. Identification of stressors has implications for the design of medical and psychiatric interventions for women."

Moreover, 3 out of the 4 AIDS-related pre-B-NHLs were extranodal lymphomas. C-myc translocations or rearrangements were not found in Italian AIDS-related NHLs, unlike c-myc activation which had a high prevalence in the American series of AIDS-related NHLs. HIV and EBV are not, or only occasionally, directly involved in AIDS-related NHL pathogenesis since HIV genome has never been found in the neoplastic clones and EBV genome was detected in only 1 out of the 6 lymphomas analyzed."
5505,0.002,2.0,"The bisheteroarylpiperazine U-90152E is a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) and possesses excellent anti-HIV activity in HIV-1-infected lymphocytes grown in tissue culture. The compound inhibits both the RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase functions of HIV-1 RT. Kinetic studies were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of RT inhibition by U-90152E. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which are based on the establishment of a rapid equilibrium between the enzyme and its substrates, proved inadequate for the analysis of the experimental data. The data were thus analyzed using Briggs-Haldane kinetics, assuming that the reaction is ordered in that the template:primer binds to the enzyme first, followed by the addition of dNTP and that the polymerase is a processive enzyme. Based on these assumptions, a velocity equation was derived, which allows the calculation of all the essential forward and backward rate constants for the reactions occurring between the enzyme, its substrates and the inhibitor. The results obtained indicate that U-90152E acts exclusively as a mixed inhibitor with respect to the template: primer and dNTP binding sites for both the RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase domains of the enzyme. The inhibitor shows a significantly higher binding affinity for the enzyme-substrate complexes than for the free enzyme and consequently does not directly impair the functions of the substrate binding sites. Therefore, U-90152E appears to impair an event occurring after the formation of the enzyme-substrate complexes, which involves either inhibition of the phosphoester bond formation or translocation of the enzyme relative to its template:primer following the formation of the ester bond."

Parallel testing of returned syringes and venous blood from IDUs was conducted to detect antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Syringe surveillance for HIV yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 89%, respectively, and provided a reasonable estimate of the prevalence of HIV among participants. Because sensitivity for HBV (34%) and HCV (55%) was low, syringe testing may be useful for surveillance of hepatitis over time but not for estimation of prevalence."
3272,0.002,2.0,"In about half of patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B, viral populations shift from utilizing the transmembrane protein CCR5 to CXCR4, as well as or instead of CCR5, during late stage progression of the disease. How the relative adhesion efficiency and fusion competency of the viral Env proteins relate to infection during this transition is not well understood. Using a virus-cell fusion assay and live-cell single-molecule force spectroscopy, we compare the entry competency of viral clones to tensile strengths of the individual Env-receptor bonds of Env proteins obtained from a HIV-1 infected patient prior to and during coreceptor switching. The results suggest that the genetic determinants of viral entry were predominantly enriched in the C3, HR1 and CD regions rather than V3. Env proteins can better mediate entry into cells after coreceptor switch; this effective entry capacity does not correlate with the bond strengths between viral Env and cellular receptors."
3101,0.002,2.0,"Reciprocal interactions between HIV and HAV or HBV can increase risk of morbidity and mortality in HIV disease and/or worsened the natural course of the hepatitis viruses. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for HIV infected patients at risk for exposure or severe disease: men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, patients with chronic liver disease and patients traveling in high endemic countries. As for healthy adults the scheme of vaccination is two doses 6 or 12 mo apart, nevertheless, seroconversion rates are lower. A third dose could improve the seroconversion rates. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all HIV infected persons lacking prior immunity. As the immune response to hepatitis B vaccines is impaired in HIV-infected adults, four double doses of hepatitis B vaccine could enhance serological response. To assume a higher immune response, vaccines should be administered in HIV-infected patients with undetectable HIV viral load and high CD4 cell count."

Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently several US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treating chronic hepatitis B, with Lamivudine (LAM) being the first oral agent made available. The major problem with LAM is significantly decreased effectiveness over time due to the development of anti-HBV resistance that can lead to virologic and biochemical breakthrough as well as hepatitis B flare, progression of liver disease, and decompensation of pre-existing cirrhosis. Despite its high anti-HBV resistant rate, LAM remains widely used in underdeveloped countries due to its wide availability and low cost compared to other antiviral medications, including those that are more effective. Therefore, it is still clinically important to learn how to prevent and treat LAM resistant strains of HBV. Several regimens with the other available antiviral agents have been studied, including switching to monotherapy with either Adefovir, Entecavir, or Tenofovir, adding Adefovir to LAM, and switching to a combination of Adefovir and Entecavir. This review article will examine molecular mechanisms and diagnosis of LAM anti-HBV resistance, risks for and approaches to reduce LAM anti-HBV resistance, and currently available rescue therapy regimens for LAM resistance.

9788,0.002,2.0,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in HIV-infected patients. Bisphosphonates such as alendronate potently inhibit bone resorption and are effective against osteoporosis. The aim of the ANRS 120 Fosivir trial was to evaluate the effect of alendronate on low BMD in HIV-infected patients. HIV-1-infected adults with a t-score≤-2.5 at the lumbar spine and/or total hip, as assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, and no other known risk factors for low BMD, were randomized to receive either extended-release alendronate 70 mg weekly or placebo for 96 weeks, with stratification for gender. All the patients also received daily calcium carbonate (500 mg) and vitamin D (400 U). The primary endpoint for efficacy was the percentage change in BMD at the site with a t-score≤-2.5. Forty-four antiretroviral-treated patients (42 men, 2 women) were enrolled. The median age was 45 years, the median CD4 cell count was 422/mm(3), and viral load was <400 copies/ml in 84% of patients. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the alendronate (n=20) and placebo (n=24) groups. At baseline, 15 patients (75%) in the alendronate group and 17 patients (71%) in the placebo group had a t-score≤-2.5 at the lumbar spine. In the main analysis, BMD at the site with a t-score≤-2.5 increased by 7.1% and 1.0%, respectively, in the alendronate (n=14) and placebo (n=20) groups at week 96 [mean difference, 6.1% (95% CI 2.8 to 9.3); p=0.0003].

9402,0.002,2.0,"Following interruption of antiretroviral therapy among individuals with acquired drug resistance, preexisting drug-sensitive virus emerges relatively rapidly. In contrast, wild-type virus is not archived in individuals infected with drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thus cannot emerge rapidly in the absence of selective drug pressure. Fourteen recently HIV-infected patients with transmitted drug-resistant virus were followed for a median of 2.1 years after the estimated date of infection (EDI) without receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV drug resistance and pol replication capacity (RC) in longitudinal plasma samples were assayed. Resistance mutations were characterized as pure populations or mixtures. The mean time to first detection of a mixture of wild-type and drug-resistant viruses was 96 weeks (1.8 years) (95% confidence interval, 48 to 192 weeks) after the EDI. The median time to loss of detectable drug resistance using population-based assays ranged from 4.1 years (conservative estimate) to longer than the lifetime of the individual (less conservative estimate). The transmission of drug-resistant virus was not associated with virus with reduced RC. Sexual transmission of HIV selects for highly fit drug-resistant variants that persist for years. The prolonged persistence of transmitted drug resistance strongly supports the routine use of HIV resistance genotyping for all newly diagnosed individuals."
9653,0.002,2.0,"A CD8+ cell non-cytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR), mediated by a CD8+ cell antiviral factor (CAF), is associated with a long-term healthy state in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. CNAR/CAF reduces viral transcription without a known effect on specific viral sequences in the HIV genome. In studies to define the mechanism involved in the block in viral transcription, we now report that transcription from the HIV-LTR reporter is reduced in infected CD4+ cells upon treatment with CAF. In agreement with this observation, the amount of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) on the HIV promoter and other viral regions was strongly diminished in HIV-infected CD4+ cells co-cultivated with CNAR-expressing CD8+ cells. These results demonstrate further that CNAR/CAF has a specific role in regulating HIV transcription and a step during the preinitiation complex assembly appears to be sensitive to CNAR/CAF. "

The variability in the functional domains of BCP and PC region of HBV and their association with disease progression and clinical outcome were assessed in Eastern India, an unique region where three HBV genotypes, A, D, and C are prevalent among the same ethnic group. PCR amplification and direct sequencing of BCP and PC region was done on sera obtained from 130 HBsAg positive subjects with different clinical presentations. Associations of the apparent risk factors with clinical advancement were evaluated by statistical methods including multiple logistic regression analyses (MLR). HBV genotype A was present in 33.08%, C in 25.38%, and D in 41.54% cases. Genotypes A and C were associated with higher rate of T1762/A1764 mutations than the most predominant genotype D. HBeAg negative state was associated with considerably higher rate of C1753 mutation. T1762/A1764 along with C1753 was common among cirrhosis and T1762/A1764 without C1753 was frequent among chronic liver disease cases. No significant association was found between A1896 point mutation and clinical status. Multivariate analysis revealed that T1762/A1764 double mutation, HBV/A, age ≥25 years, C1753 and A1899 were critical factors for clinical advancement while age ≥25 years and C1753 as significant predictor for cirrhosis in comparison with chronic liver disease. In conclusion, the analysis of the BCP variability may help in monitoring the progression towards advanced liver disease in Eastern Indian patients."
6579,0.002,2.0,"A collaborative group for studying vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 in pregnant women and their babies was established in Japan in 1989. Forty-two infants, including 13 HIV-1-infected, 25 uninfected and four of undetermined status and 15 control children born to HIV-1 negative mothers were diagnosed and followed from birth to 1.5 years. All strains from HIV-positive infants were either clade E (eight infants, 61.5%) or B (five infants, 38.5%) according to DNA sequencing specific for the HIV-1 C2-V3 region. The 42 mothers with HIV-1 were women with sexual-risk behavior from all regions, but were concentrated in the Kanto District. In this group of HIV-infected children, there was no significant difference between the transmissibility of their mother's clade E and B viruses. Eight (61.5%) of the 13 virus-infected babies were Japanese and five (62.5%) of the eight were positive for HIV-1 clade E. The V3 loop region of the clade E virus of the babies was conserved but approximately 60% of the sequences which showed a substitution of aspartic acid by asparagine at position 29. The results suggest that HIV-1 clade E may be predominant in vertical transmissions and are phenotypically different from HIV-1 in persons with various other risk behaviors in Japan."

This is a health facility-based study. Ninety one consenting, asymptomatic attendees of public healthcare facilities in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria, were consecutively selected for this study. Plasma samples of the study participants were tested for the presence of anti-HAV IgG using a HAV Ab Competitive Enzyme Immunoassay test kit. Ninety (98.9%) of the participants were seropositive for anti-HAV IgG antibody; group-specific prevalence was also high, but association of participants' variables with the prevalence could not be obtained due to limited sample size and high group-specific prevalence. Since the hepatitis A vaccine is not currently used in Nigeria, the chance is high that the HAV IgG antibody-positive individuals were naturally infected; consequently Osogbo can be described as highly endemic for HAV infection."
4189,0.002,2.0,"The launch of generic forms of some of the drugs included in fixed-dose combinations of antiretrovirals (FDCA) raises the potential risk of breaking these combinations in order to allow the administration of the new cheaper generic drug. This could result in a step back in some major advances achieved in simplicity and treatment adherence, resulting in an increased risk of selective treatment withdrawal of some of the drugs administered separately. Due to the mechanism of action of the currently available antiretroviral treatment administration must be life-long in infected individuals, both children and adults. FDCA are a significant advance in antiretroviral treatment simplification, contributing to increase compliance of complex chronic therapies, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. They reduce the risk of treatment errors and can also reduce the possibility of unprescribed monotherapy with selective non-compliance. Hence, they contribute to reduce the risk of selection of HIV-1 clones with antiretroviral resistance, a situation that not only compromises future treatment options of the infected individual, but can also be transmitted and are a situation of Public Health concern. Excluding those cases that require a particular dose adjustment, FDCA are a preferred treatment option and their use must be strongly recommended in all scenarios where the components included in the combination are preferred drugs."
7235,0.002,2.0,"Ocular microangiopathic syndrome including retinal and conjunctival abnormalities is frequently found in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) disease. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent neoplasia found in patients with HIV-1 disease. We have recently reported a significant association between conjunctival microvasculopathy and KS in 117 patients with HIV-1 disease. The objective of the present study was to determine whether this association is existent when matched patients with and without KS are compared. A total of 22 matched pairs were obtained under consideration of the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count, Walter Reed (WR) classification, gender, and serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin and neopterin. Conjunctival microangiopathy was determined for each eye by a standardized rating scale ranging from 0 to 5, allowing a reliable and valid quantification of conjunctival blood-flow sludging. The mean value obtained for conjunctival sludge was 1.8 (SEM, 0.4) for patients without KS and 3.2 (SEM, 0.3) for patients with KS, demonstrating a clinically and statistically significant difference between the two groups (Student's t = 3.0; P = 0.003). This difference was higher when patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count exceeding 200/microliters were regarded. Similar factors or mechanisms may contribute to HIV-related conjunctival microvasculopathy and KS."
733,0.002,2.0,"beta 2-Microglobulin and lysozyme were determined in paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 137 patients, using immunofluorometry and ELISA, respectively. Of these patients, 54 were infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV1) (including 20 AIDS dementia patients), 73 were HIV1-seronegative with neurological diseases (meningitis (n = 10), multiple sclerosis (n = 29), other neurological diseases (n = 34)) and 10 were controls. Intrathecal synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin occurred in each group. Conversely, lysozyme intrathecal synthesis was found only in meningitis (10/10) and in HIV1-infection (24/54). A pathological increase in beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis (> or = 2 mg/l) was observed in 45 patients (34 HIV1-infected patients and 11 HIV1-seronegative patients with neurological diseases). Serum concentration and intrathecal synthesis of beta 2-microglobulin were correlated only in the 20 AIDS dementia patients. The cerebrospinal fluid beta 2-microglobulin and lysozyme concentrations were correlated in the 54 HIV1-infected patients only. Blood CD4 + T-cell count was correlated negatively with beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis but not with lysozyme intrathecal synthesis. These data suggest that in the absence of any central nervous system opportunistic process the increase of beta 2-microglobulin intrathecal synthesis (> or = 2 mg/l) may be a reliable marker of central nervous system involvement in HIV1-infected patients. Intrathecal synthesis of lysozyme was related principally to HIV1-encephalitis and central nervous system opportunistic processes."

In the current study we demonstrated that intrasplenic inoculation of hu-DKO mice with HIV-1 initiated a higher level of HIV infection than intravenous or intraperitoneal inoculation, associated with a reciprocal decrease in peripheral CD4(+) T cells and increase in peripheral CD8(+) T cells. HIV infection by intrasplenic injection increased serum levels of human IgG and IgM including human IgM and IgG specific for HIV-1 gp120. There was a significant inverse correlation between the level of HIV-1 infection and the extent of CD4(+) T cell depletion. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiated 1 week after HIV-1 inoculation markedly suppressed HIV-1 infection and prevented CD4(+) T cell depletion. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that intrasplenic injection of hu-DKO mice with HIV is a more efficient route of HIV infection than intravenous or intraperitoneal injection and generates increased infection associated with an increased anti-HIV humoral response. This animal model can serve as a valuable in vivo model to study the efficacy of anti-HIV therapies."
6212,0.002,2.0,"Biological interactions between human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were analysed in transfection and infection experiments, carried out in a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (HOS) and in the same cell line chronically infected with HCMV (E155). When HOS and E155 cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids containing the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, LTR-directed CAT expression was 20 times higher in E155 cells than in HOS cells. HOS cells co-infected with HCMV and HIV-1 showed enhanced production of the HIV-1 p24 antigen. In reciprocal experiments, an increase in HCMV immediate early gene expression was observed when HCMV-infected HOS cells and E155 cells were either transfected with a recombinant plasmid containing the HIV transactivator gene (pTAT), or when infected with HIV-1. DNA hybridization analysis of E155 and HCMV-infected HOS cells revealed higher levels of HCMV DNA in cells transfected with pTAT than in cells transfected with other non-specific recombinant plasmids. E155 cells transfected with pTAT also produced higher titres of infectious HCMV than control cultures of E155 cells transfected with other recombinant plasmids, including pMTAT carrying a mutant tat gene. The functional reciprocity in vitro between HCMV and HIV is discussed with respect to its possible implications for the clinical development of AIDS."
2083,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have demonstrated that the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection with adefovir (ADV) can impair renal function. In contrast, treatment with telbivudine (LdT) improves renal function in CHB patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the renoprotective effect of LdT in CHB patients receiving ADV-based combination therapy. The effects of treatment with ADV + LdT on renal function were compared to those resulting from treatment with ADV + entecavir (ETV), ADV + lamivudine (LAM), ADV alone and ETV alone. The consecutive cohort analysis included 831 CHB patients who received ADV + LdT, ADV + LAM, ADV + ETV, ADV alone or ETV alone for 96 weeks. Alterations in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared between the five groups using a linear mixed-effects model. HBV DNA levels were also compared between the five groups during the 96-week period. Among the five treatment groups, significant improvements in eGFR were observed in the ADV + LdT and ADV + LAM groups over time (P < 0.001 for each group compared with baseline eGFR). In patients with a baseline eGFR between 50 and 90 mL/min, the change in eGFR was the most significant in the ADV + LdT group (+0.641 mL/min; P < 0.001). Age, gender, baseline eGFR and treatment option were significant predictive factors for eGFR changes. In conclusion, our results suggest that the combination therapy of LdT and ADV is significantly associated with renoprotective effects in CHB patients when compared with other ADV-based combination or single therapies.

3304,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein is essential for viral replication and stimulates transcription of the integrated provirus by recruiting the kinase complex TAK/P-TEFb, composed of cyclin T1 (CycT1) and Cdk9, to the viral TAR RNA element. TAK/P-TEFb phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II complex and stimulates transcriptional elongation. In this report, we investigated the regulation of TAK/P-TEFb in primary human macrophages, a major target cell of HIV infection. While Cdk9 levels remained constant, CycT1 protein expression in freshly isolated monocytes was very low, increased early during macrophage differentiation, and, unexpectedly, decreased to very low levels after about 1 week in culture. The kinase activity of TAK/P-TEFb paralleled the changes in CycT1 protein expression. RNA analysis indicated that the transient induction of CycT1 protein expression involves a posttranscriptional mechanism. In transient transfection assays, the ability of Tat to transactivate the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) in the late differentiated macrophages was greatly diminished relative to its ability to transactivate the HIV LTR in early differentiated cells, strongly suggesting that CycT1 is limiting for Tat function in late differentiated macrophages. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide, a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, reinduced CycT1 expression late in macrophage differentiation. These results raise the possibility that regulation of CycT1 expression may be involved in establishing latent infection in macrophages and that opportunistic infection may reactivate the virus by inducing CycT1 expression."
7929,0.002,2.0,"Co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is relatively common. However, the impact of this co-infection on the clinical outcome of HIV infection has not been elucidated. We herein demonstrate that the HBV X protein (HBx) superinduces ongoing HIV-1 replication and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) transcription by synergizing with Tat protein and with T-cell activation signals. Although HBx cooperated with mitogenic stimuli in the induction of reporter plasmids harboring the HIV-1 kappaB enhancer, in both a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and a NF-AT-dependent manner, deletion of this element from the LTR did not affect the HBx-mediated up-regulation in the presence of Tat and/or mitogens. In contrast, mutation of the proximal LTR Sp1-binding sites abolished the HBx-mediated synergistic activation, but only when it was accompanied by deletion of the kappaB enhancer. When HBx was targeted to the nucleus, its ability to synergize with cellular activation stimuli was maintained. Furthermore, mutations of HBx affecting its interaction with the basal transcription machinery abrogated the synergistic activation by HBx, suggesting that this protein exerts its function by acting as a nuclear co-activator. These results indicate that HBx could contribute to a faster progression to AIDS in HBV-HIV co-infected individuals."
6566,0.002,2.0,"Nevirapine, a component of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings, known for auto-induction of metabolism, is initiated at half therapeutic dose until day 14 ('lead-in period'), and subsequently escalated to full dose. However, studies have shown that this dosing strategy based on adult studies may not be appropriate in children, given that younger children have higher drug clearance rates. In this prospective cohort study, we studied trough plasma nevirapine levels by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at days 7, 14 (lead-in period) and 28 (full dose period) after ART initiation amongst HIV-1 infected children initiating nevirapine-based ART in southern India. Among the 20 children (50% male, median age 9 years) included in the study, sub-therapeutic trough plasma nevirapine concentration (<4μg/ml) was seen in 65% (13/20) of children during the lead-in period within two weeks of ART initiation and among 10% of children at 4 weeks during full-dose nevirapine. Adherence was documented as ≥95% in all children by both caregiver self-report and pill count. Median nevirapine concentrations achieved at week 1 was 4.8 μg/ml, significantly lower than 8 μg/ml, the concentration achieved at week 4 (p = 0.034). Virological failure at one year of ART was observed in six children, and was not associated with median nevirapine concentration achieved during week 1, 2 or 4. We conclude that the dose escalation strategy currently practiced among young children living with HIV-1 resulted in significant subtherapeutic nevirapine concentration (≤4μg/ml) during the lead-in period. We call for a closer look at pediatric-focused dosing strategies for nevirapine initiation in young children. Further studies to establish age-appropriate threshold nevirapine concentration are warranted in young children to corroborate the role of therapeutic drug monitoring in predicting virological outcome."
1274,0.002,2.0,"The rapid scale-up of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and use of single dose Nevirapine (SD NVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) have raised fears about the emergence of resistance to the first line antiretroviral drug regimens. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of primary drug resistance (PDR) in a cohort of young (<25 yrs) HAART-naïve HIV pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe. Whole blood was collected in EDTA for CD4 counts, viral load, serological estimation of duration of infection using the BED Calypte assay and genotyping for drug resistance. Four hundred and seventy-one women, mean age 21 years; SD: 2.1 were enrolled into the study between 2006 and 2007. Their median CD4 count was 371cells/µL; IQR: 255-511 cells/µL. Two hundred and thirty-six samples were genotyped for drug resistance. Based on the BED assay, 27% were recently infected (RI) whilst 73% had long-term infection (LTI). Median CD4 count was higher (p<0.05) in RI than in women with LTI. Only 2 women had drug resistance mutations; protease I85V and reverse transcriptase Y181C. Prevalence of PDR in Chitungwiza, 4 years after commencement of the national ART program remained below WHO threshold limit (5%). Frequency of recent infection BED testing is consistent with high HIV acquisition during pregnancy. With the scale-up of long-term ART programs, maintenance of proper prescribing practices, continuous monitoring of patients and reinforcement of adherence may prevent the acquisition and transmission of PDR."
6094,0.002,2.0,"Pneumocystis carinii is a ubiquitous, atypical unicellular fungus. P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, and is the leading complication in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many different host (mammal)-specific species of Pneumocystis exist, but the life-cycle is not understood fully. Human strains are designated as P. carinii f. sp. (special form) hominis (at least 59 different types). P. carinii is spread via the airborne route. Disease is most frequently caused by fresh exposure to a source of P. carinii, rather than by reactivation of latent infection. Asymptomatic carriage among healthy persons may occur. PCP occurs in HIV-infected patients when the CD4+ count falls below a certain threshold; organisms multiply and gradually fill the alveoli. Symptoms, which include a mildly productive cough, progressive dyspnoea and fever, may persist for months prior to diagnosis. Without treatment, progressive respiratory insufficiency invariably ends in death. Pulmonary specimens may be obtained by procedures of varying sensitivity and risk. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by detection of stained organisms; however, staining procedures vary in sensitivity and ease of use. Robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols with good predictive results may be useful in the future. Therapy falls into two categories: for acute primary infections and for prophylaxis. A confirmed diagnosis ensures that patients do not receive potentially toxic medication (adverse drug reactions can occur). Prophylaxis can dramatically reduce the frequency of PCP in HIV patients, and its more widespread use should lead to a decline in the incidence of PCP in the future."

1051,0.002,2.0,"A human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient in 2007 has the option to commence an antiretroviral regimen that is extremely efficacious in suppressing the virus and has few side effects. In a recent study, we estimated the median remaining lifetime of a newly diagnosed 25-year-old HIV-infected individual to be 39 years. The prospect of a near-normal life expectancy has implications for the HIV-infected persons as well as for the handling of the disease in the healthcare system. The patients can now on a long-term perspective plan their professional career, join a pension plan and start a family. Further, they may expect to be treated equally with other members of society with respect to access to mortgage, health insurance and life insurance. As the infected population ages, more patients will contract age-related diseases, and the disease burden on some individuals may even come to be dominated by non-HIV-related conditions that may have a worse prognosis and therefore become more important than HIV-related conditions. Despite the improvements in antiretroviral therapy, there is still an excess mortality among HIV patients, which appears to be only partially attributable to immunodeficiency, with lifestyle factors potentially playing a pronounced role. Consequently, an effort to further increase survival must target risk factors for both HIV-related and -unrelated mortality. The continuation of the positive trend may be achieved by increased HIV testing, earlier initiation of antiretroviral therapy, improved drug adherence, prevention and treatment of HIV-unrelated co-morbidity and collaboration with other medical specialists to treat an ageing co-morbidity-acquiring HIV population."
4998,0.002,2.0,"Medications constituted the third largest health care expenditure for children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Previous literature had not investigated volume or cost of pharmaceuticals consumed by individual patients.

Starting in 1991, it surveyed 100 children with AIDS and 41 HIV-infected children (via adult proxies) six times at quarterly intervals and collected their outpatient bills. These children reported using 5,634 prescriptions and had 5,026 bills. Children with AIDS reported more prescriptions than HIV-infected children. On the basis of CD4 counts and age, 14.2% of children had indications for antiretrovirals, but did not receive them; and 17.7% warranted PCP prophylaxis but did not receive it. Outpatient bills averaged $2,325 and inpatient bills averaged $7,725 per year. These amounts projected nationally to $48.2 million annually, mostly paid by Medicaid."
3004,0.002,2.0,"The impact of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) on anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was studied in 17 patients with recent symptomatic HIV-1 primary infection receiving triple combination therapy. Anti-HIV CTL were initially detected in 15 patients. In 6, CTL disappeared rapidly and persistently after initiation of therapy. Most of them had a rapid and sustained decrease in plasma HIV RNA to undetectable levels. Conversely, in 6 other patients, CTL remained detectable, which was associated with a less efficient control of viral replication. In 3 others, CTL disappeared only transiently, without clear correlation with the virologic profile. Altogether, despite individual variations, there was a positive correlation between viral replication and anti-HIV-1 cytotoxicity in most subjects, suggesting that the persistence of viral antigens is the main determinant for the maintenance of CTL activity. This raises the question of the potential benefit of anti-HIV CTL induction by immunotherapy in acute seroconverters treated by HAART."

Exon 1 of the MBL gene was amplified by PCR in 61 patients with chronic HBV infection, 28 patients with acute infection and in 60 controls. MBL variants were detected by subsequent restriction enzyme digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis. The occurrence of the codon 52 mutation in patients with chronic HBV infection did not differ significantly from that in controls or patients with acute infection (9 vs. 7%), nor were there any significant differences for the codon 54 mutation. The frequency of MBL variants at codon 52 and 54 is not increased in patients with chronic HBV infection.

1493,0.002,2.0,"In this update, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all patients infected by type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). The strength and grade of the recommendation vary depending on the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, the presence of opportunistic infections or comorbid conditions, age, and the efforts to prevent the transmission of HIV. The objective of ART is to achieve an undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). Initial ART should comprise three drugs, namely, two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and one drug from another family. Three of the recommended regimens, all of which have an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) as the third drug, are considered a preferred regimen; a further seven regimens, which are based on an INSTI, an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor boosted with ritonavir (PI/r), are considered alternatives. The reasons and criteria for switching ART are presented both for patients with an undetectable PVL and for patients who experience virological failure, in which case the rescue regimen should include three (or at least two) drugs that are fully active against HIV. The specific criteria for ART in special situations (acute infection, HIV-2 infection, pregnancy) and comorbid conditions (tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer) are updated.

HIV-1 is capable of generating phenotypic variants in the face of a variety of selective pressures. The potential to generate variants with reduced sensitivity to a protease inhibitor was examined by selecting for virus growth in cell culture in the presence of the protease inhibitor A-77003. Virus variants grew out in the presence of the inhibitor, and these variants encoded proteases with reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor. Variants were identified that encoded changes in each of the three subsites of the protease that interact with the inhibitor. HIV-1 displays significant potential for altering its interaction with this protease inhibitor, suggesting the need for multiple protease inhibitors with varying specificities."
3087,0.002,2.0,"To characterize the associations of age, immunosuppression, and AIDS outcomes, we evaluated serial measures of CD4+ lymphocytes from 376 homosexual men with documented dates of HIV-1 seroconversion registered in the Tricontinental Seroconverter Study. Using regression models and adjusting for variation within individuals, we found no association between age and the number of CD4+ lymphocytes at seroconversion or with CD4+ lymphocyte decline after seroconversion. Men who developed opportunistic infections had fewer CD4+ lymphocytes at the time of diagnosis compared with men who developed AIDS-defining Kaposi's sarcoma. Older age was significantly associated with higher numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes in individuals diagnosed with AIDS-defining Kaposi's sarcoma but was not significant for individuals with opportunistic infections. Because older age shortens the latency period of Kaposi's sarcoma and does not affect the CD4+ lymphocyte loss, it results in higher CD4+ lymphocytes at the time of diagnosis. These findings suggest distinct biologic mechanisms for various AIDS manifestations, which is important for clinical decision making and health care planning."
4913,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses are endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, but data regarding the prevalence of hepatitis co-infections in HIV-positive individuals residing there are limited. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and occult HBV (presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg) in a rural, South African cohort. The results were compared to various ethnic groups in a Dutch cohort of people infected with HIV. Antiretroviral-naïve individuals with HIV from both a rural South African clinic (n = 258), and a Dutch University hospital (n = 782), were included. Both serological (HBV and HCV) and molecular (occult HBV) assays were performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to define independent predictors of a hepatitis co-infection. HBV and HCV prevalence rates in the South African cohort were exceptionally low (0.4%, 1/242 and 0.8%, 2/242, respectively), compared to those observed in Caucasians (HBV 4.4% and HCV 10.9%) and African immigrants (HBV 8.9% and HCV 4.8%). Conversely, occult HBV was observed in a considerable proportion (10%, 6/60) of South African patients who were anti-HBc-positive but HBsAg-negative. Occult infections were less frequent in Caucasians and Africans in the Dutch cohort (3.2% and 1.4%, respectively). Independent predictors for occult HBV were not identified, but a trend towards more occult HBV at lower CD4 counts was observed. Local HBV/HCV prevalence data are needed to optimize vaccination and antiretroviral treatment strategies. Occult HBV in patients with HIV may be missed regularly when molecular analyses are not available."
8802,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1 subtype C (C-HIV) is responsible for most HIV-1 cases worldwide. Although the pathogenesis of C-HIV is thought to predominantly involve CCR5-restricted (R5) strains, we do not have a firm understanding of how frequently CXCR4-using (X4 and R5X4) variants emerge in subjects with progressive C-HIV infection. Nor do we completely understand the molecular determinants of coreceptor switching by C-HIV variants. Here, we characterized a panel of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Envs) (n = 300) cloned sequentially from plasma of 21 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve subjects who experienced progression from chronic to advanced stages of C-HIV infection, and show that CXCR4-using C-HIV variants emerged in only one individual. Mutagenesis studies and structural models suggest that the evolution of R5 to X4 variants in this subject principally involved acquisition of an ""Ile-Gly"" insertion in the gp120 V3 loop and replacement of the V3 ""Gly-Pro-Gly"" crown with a ""Gly-Arg-Gly"" motif, but that the accumulation of additional gp120 ""scaffold"" mutations was required for these V3 loop changes to confer functional effects. In this context, either of the V3 loop changes could confer possible transitional R5X4 phenotypes, but when present together they completely abolished CCR5 usage and conferred the X4 phenotype. Our results show that the emergence of CXCR4-using strains is rare in this cohort of untreated individuals with advanced C-HIV infection. In the subject where X4 variants did emerge, alterations in the gp120 V3 loop were necessary but not sufficient to confer CXCR4 usage."
3769,0.002,2.0,"The efficacy of specifically targeted anti-viral therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) (STAT-C), including HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors, is limited by the presence of drug-specific viral resistance mutations within the targeted proteins. Genetic diversity within these viral proteins also evolves under selective pressures provided by host human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted immune responses, which may therefore influence STAT-C treatment response. Here, the prevalence of drug resistance mutations relevant to 27 developmental STAT-C drugs, and the potential for drug and immune selective pressures to intersect at sites along the HCV genome, is explored. HCV nonstructural (NS) 3 protease or NS5B polymerase sequences and HLA assignment were obtained from study populations from Australia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Four hundred five treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HCV infection were considered (259 genotype 1, 146 genotype 3), of which 38.5% were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We identified preexisting STAT-C drug resistance mutations in sequences from this large cohort. The frequency of the variations varied according to individual STAT-C drug and HCV genotype/subtype. Of individuals infected with subtype 1a, 21.5% exhibited genetic variation at a known drug resistance site. Furthermore, we identified areas in HCV protease and polymerase that are under both potential HLA-driven pressure and therapy selection and identified six HLA-associated polymorphisms (P <or= 0.05) at known drug resistance sites."

Recombinant HIV-1SF2 viruses expressing the envelope gp120 gene of HIV-ISF162 caused as rapid a CD4+ T-cell depletion as did HIV-1SF162. The reciprocal HIV-1SF162 recombinant virus with the HIV-1SF2 envelope caused slower CD4+ T-cell loss. Although changing the V3 loop sequence of HIV-1SF162 to that of HIV-1SF2 did not change the rate of CD4+ T-cell depletion, replacing the V3 of HIV-1SF2 with the sequence of HIV-1SF162 resulted in virus that was poorly infectious in vivo but not in vitro.

1444,0.002,2.0,"The novel 2'-deoxyguanosine analog Entecavir (ETV) is a potent inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and is recommended for treatment in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HBV-co-infected patients because it had been reported that ETV is HBV-specific. Recent clinical observations, however, have suggested that ETV may indeed demonstrate anti-HIV-1 activity. To investigate this question at a molecular level, kinetic studies were used to examine the interaction of 5'-triphosphate form of ETV with wild type (WT) HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-resistant mutation M184V. Using single turnover kinetic assays, we found that HIV-1 WT RT and M184V RT could use the activated ETV triphosphate metabolite as a substrate for incorporation. The mutant displayed a slower incorporation rate, a lower binding affinity, and a lower incorporation efficiency with the 5'-triphosphate form of ETV compared with WT RT, suggesting a kinetic basis for resistance. Our results are supported by cell-based assays in primary human lymphocytes that show inhibition of WT HIV-1 replication by ETV and decreased susceptibility of the HIV-1 containing the M184V mutation. This study has important therapeutic implications as it establishes ETV as an inhibitor for HIV-1 RT and illustrates the mechanism of resistance by the M184V mutant."

The antiviral activity of the inflammasome cytoplasmic complex recognises viral molecular patterns and regulates immune responses via the activation of interleukin (IL)-1 family (IL-1, IL-18 and IL-33) members. The association between polymorphisms in the inflammasome receptors NLRP1 and NLRP3 and HTLV-1 infection was evaluated in a northeastern Brazilian population (84 HTLV-1 carriers and 155 healthy controls). NLRP3 rs10754558 G/G was associated with protection against HTLV-1 infection (p = 0.012; odds ratio = 0.37). rs10754558 affects NLRP3 mRNA stability; therefore, our results suggest that higher NLRP3 expression may augment first-line defences, leading to the effective protection against HTLV-1 infection.

2499,0.002,2.0,"By using target cells that expressed isolated env, gag, p27nef, or p23vif molecules introduced by recombinant vaccinia viruses containing genes encoding these polypeptides, it was possible to identify env, gag, p27nef, and p23vif as cytolytic target antigens for freshly isolated blood cells from human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive patients. Most of the patients tested (95%) manifested a specific cytotoxic activity against vaccinia virus-env-infected target cells. The env-specific cytotoxic activity was not restricted by the major histocompatibility complex and was not mediated by T lymphocytes, as shown by the absence of blocking effect with an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody and by the inefficiency of CD3+, CD8+, or CD4+ and CD8+ depletion to reduce the cytotoxic activity against the env-expressing target cells. In the same conditions, the cytotoxic activity specific for gag was abrogated and gag major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes were detected in 85% of the subjects tested. Therefore, in a HIV-1 seropositive subject, distinct types of effector cells mediate the lysis of target cells expressing gag and env proteins."
936,0.002,2.0,"It has been suggested that immune selection pressure exerted by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response could be responsible for viral persistence during chronic hepatitis B virus infection. To address this question, in the current study we compared the DNA and amino acid sequences of, and the CTL responses to, multiple HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes in the hepatitis B virus in several HLA-A2-positive patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. Our results indicate that the CTL response to these epitopes is barely detectable in the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis. Further, we show that the weak CTL response is not secondary in infection by mutant viruses lacking these epitopes, and we show that the CTL response did not select for escape mutants in any of these patients. We conclude that an ineffective hepatitis B virus specific CTL response is the primary determinant of viral persistence in chronic hepatitis and that immune selection of viral variants is not a common event in the majority of patients."
3664,0.002,2.0,"Individuals with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are generally divided into asymptomatic healthy carriers and patients with chronic liver disease. Several studies have suggested that the core antigen (HBcAg) could be an immunological target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). To investigate the possible pressure site from CTL, the entire core region of HBV DNA was sequenced in 30 subjects (10 asymptomatic healthy carriers and 20 patients with chronic liver disease). No significant changes in the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid residue were noted in the 10 healthy carriers. In contrast, a cluster of changes in small segment of 18 amino acids (codon 84 to 101 from the start of the core gene) was found in 15 of the 20 chronic liver disease patients. All these 15 patients had advanced liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis), whereas only mild liver disease (chronic persistent hepatitis) was found in the 5 patients without mutation. These data suggest that this region with clustering mutations may play an important role in the pathogenesis of B viral liver disease, and the mutations in the region may be related to progressive liver disease."

Transfusion of infected blood, unprotected sex and mother to child transmission are 3 key transmission routes of HBV in Ghana. There is high incidence of blood demanding health situations in northern Ghana resulting from anemia, accidents, malnutrition, etc. The higher the demand, the higher the possibility of transmitting HBV through infected blood. The aim of the investigation was to estimate the prevalence of HBV in blood donors which will provide justification for interventions that will help minimize or eliminate HBV infection in Ghana."
4922,0.002,2.0,"Serum and intrahepatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA were measured in 37 HIV-HCV co-infected patients with controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and correlated with clinical, biological, and histological parameters. Thirty-seven interferon-naive patients underwent liver biopsy. HCV-induced activity (A) and fibrosis (F) were evaluated with METAVIR score. The 37 patients included had HIV plasma loads < 10,000 copies/ml, CD4(+) count > 250/microl. All the patients but two were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Liver tissue and sera were used for measurement of HCV RNA by the Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor. All patients had serum and liver HCV RNA, and both levels were correlated (r = 0.47; P = 0.003). Intrahepatic HCV load did not depend on age, sex, duration of HCV infection, CD4(+), HCV genotype, or fibrosis. AST levels correlated with intrahepatic HCV load (r = 0.52; P = 0.001). Patients with METAVIR A1/A2 had significantly lower levels of liver HCV-RNA than were found in patients with METAVIR A3 (P = 0.026). Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) including protease inhibitors(PI)-treated patients had significantly lower intrahepatic HCV load (P = 0.04). A weak but significant correlation between serum and liver HCV RNA was found. The amount of hepatic HCV RNA was correlated with AST levels, histological activity, but not with HCV genotype or fibrosis. The immune improvement associated with PI regimens could help reduce HCV load, supporting a protective effect of PI-induced immune restoration."
8163,0.002,2.0,"An ultrastructural study was performed on rabbit epithelial RK-13 cells and CD4+ human T lymphocyte lines infected with various recombinant vaccinia viruses (RVVs) expressing genes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): the mature p17 or p24 gag domain alone, the entire or truncated gag gene, the reverse transcriptase domain, or the gag-pol genes with a frameshift mutation. Cells infected with RVVs that produced the gag polyprotein with a predicted Mr of more than 48K showed budding and release of HIV-like particles into the extracellular space. These particles were not observed in cells expressing a truncated gag gene (p17 and p24 regions). Mature HIV-like particles were observed extracellularly when the entire gag gene and the protease region of the pol gene were expressed. In contrast, in cells infected with RVVs that contained the gag-pol gene with a frameshift mutation, neither recognizable budding structures nor extracellular HIV-like particles could be detected. These results suggest that the gag gene, particularly its 3' terminus, is necessary for the assembly of HIV particles. In addition, the protease region of the pol gene seems to be required for morphological maturation of HIV particles, but complete proteolytic cleavage of the gag protein may prevent bud formation."

8705,0.002,2.0,"A group of conserved hydrophobic residues faces the interior of the coiled-coil-like structure within the N-terminal domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) capsid protein (CA). It has been suggested that these residues are important for maintaining stable structure and functional activity. To investigate this possibility, we constructed two HIV-1 clones, in which Trp23 or Phe40 was changed to Ala. We also constructed a third mutant, D51A, which has a mutation that destroys a salt bridge between Pro1 and Asp51. All three mutants are replication defective but produce virus particles. Mutant virions contain all of the viral proteins, although the amount and stability of CA are decreased and levels of virion-associated integrase are reduced. The mutations do not affect endogenous reverse transcriptase activity; however, the mutants are blocked in their ability to initiate reverse transcription in infected cells and no minus-strand strong-stop DNA is detected. The defect in reverse transcription is associated with striking defects in the morphology of mutant virus cores, as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Our data indicate that the mutations made in this study disrupt CA structure and prevent proper maturation of virus cores. We propose that this results in a defect in core stability or in an early postentry event preceding reverse transcription."
7971,0.002,2.0,"We have previously shown that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein can activate a synthetic promoter containing consensus-binding sites for the cellular transcription factor Sp1. In this report, we show that a GAL-Tat fusion protein targeted via GAL4 DNA-binding sites can also trans activate an HIV-1 LTR promoter independently of the trans-activation response region. To show that the trans activation of the promoter by Tat directly involves the Sp1 protein, we have targeted a GAL-Sp1 fusion protein to the long terminal repeat promoter via upstream GAL4-binding sites. In the presence of Tat and GAL-Sp1, the promoter is synergistically trans activated at the transcriptional level, indicating that Tat and Sp1 functionally interact to trans activate the HIV-1 promoter. The Sp1 synergism is relatively specific, since another chimeric transcriptional activator, GAL-VP16, does not appear to be significantly synergistic with Tat."
3930,0.002,2.0,"Vaccines designed to elicit AIDS virus-specific CD8+ T cells should engender broad responses. Emerging data indicate that alternate reading frames (ARFs) of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encode CD8+ T cell epitopes, termed cryptic epitopes. Here, we show that SIV-specific CD8+ T cells from SIV-infected rhesus macaques target 14 epitopes in eight ARFs during SIV infection. Animals recognized up to five epitopes, totaling nearly one-quarter of the anti-SIV responses. The epitopes were targeted by high-frequency responses as early as 2 weeks postinfection and in the chronic phase. Hence, previously overlooked ARF-encoded epitopes could be important components of AIDS vaccines."
3928,0.002,2.0,"In the infected human hepatocyte, expression of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) accessory protein X (HBx) is essential to maintain viral replication in vivo. HBx critically interacts with the host damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) and the associated ubiquitin ligase machinery, suggesting that HBx functions by inducing the degradation of host proteins. To identify such host proteins, we systematically analyzed the HBx interactome. One HBx interacting protein, talin-1 (TLN1), was proteasomally degraded upon HBx expression. Further analysis showed that TLN1 levels indeed modulate HBV transcriptional activity in an HBx-dependent manner. This indicates that HBx-mediated TLN1 degradation is essential and sufficient to stimulate HBV replication. Our data show that TLN1 can act as a viral restriction factor that suppresses HBV replication, and suggest that the HBx relieves this restriction by inducing TLN1 degradation."
1102,0.002,2.0,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in innate immunity against pathogens. Their stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB, an important inducer of HIV-1 replication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies using several cells types from HIV-infected patients indicate that TLRs play a key role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the effect of HIV-1 stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from healthy donors on the expression and functions of TLR2 and TLR4 was examined. In addition, and to complete the in vitro study, the expression pattern of TLR2 and TLR4 in 49 HIV-1-infected patients, classified according to viral load and the use of HAART, was determined and compared with 25 healthy subjects. An increase of TLR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in MDMs and PBMCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and in response to TLR stimulation, compared to the mock. In addition, an association between TLR expression and up-regulation of CD80 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was observed. The ex vivo analysis indicated increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), but only of TLR2 in monocytes obtained from HIV-1-infected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Remarkably, the expression was higher in cells from patients who do not use HAART. In monocytes, there was a positive correlation between both TLRs and viral load, but not CD4(+) T cell numbers. Together, our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that TLR expression and function can be up-regulated in response to HIV-1 infection and could affect the inflammatory response. We propose that modulation of TLRs represents a mechanism to promote HIV-1 replication or AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients."
728,0.002,2.0,"Mathematical modeling of viral replication dynamics, based on sequential measurements of levels of virion-associated RNA in plasma during antiretroviral treatment, has led to fundamental new insights into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 pathogenesis. We took advantage of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque model to perform detailed measurements and mathematical modeling during primary infection and during treatment of established infection with the antiretroviral drug (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA). The calculated clearance half-life for productively infected cells during resolution of the peak viremia of primary infection was on the order of 1 day, with slightly shorter clearance half-lives calculated during PMPA treatment. Viral reproduction rates upon discontinuation of PMPA treatment after 2 weeks were approximately twofold greater than those obtained just prior to initiation of treatment in the same animals, likely reflecting accumulation of susceptible target cells during treatment. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) for the spread of SIV infection in vivo, which represents the number of productively infected cells derived from each productively infected cell at the beginning of infection, was also estimated. This parameter quantifies the extent to which antiviral therapy or vaccination must limit the initial spread of virus to prevent establishment of chronic disseminated infection. The results thus provide an important guide for efforts to develop vaccines against SIV and, by extension, human immunodeficiency virus."

6149,0.002,2.0,"The time of spread of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from lymphoid to nonlymphoid tissues in the course of infection was investigated by sequence comparisons of variants infecting a range of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues from three individuals with AIDS in the pl7gag gene and regions flanking the V1/V2 hypervariable regions. Phylogenetic analysis in both regions revealed several lineages in each individual that contained sequences from both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues such as the brain. This observation contrasts strongly with the previously described organ-specific sequences in the V3 region in this study population and other investigations. Although individual pairwise comparisons of relatively short sequences such as p17gag are subject to considerable stochastic error, we found that the diversity of gag sequences in variants from lymphoid tissue was consistently lower than that found among variants amplified from the brain. By estimating mean synonymous pairwise distances in the p17gag region, we were able to make an approximate calculation of the ages of populations in different tissues. Those from lymphoid tissue ranged from 2.65 to 5.6 years in the three study subjects, compared with 4.1 to 6.2 years for variants in the brain. Indeed, variants infecting the brain were no more closely related to each other than they were to variants infecting other tissues in the body. In two of the three individuals, these times of divergence indicate that infection of the brain may have occurred as an early event in the progression to disease, preceding the onset of AIDS by several years. This study is the first in which it was possible to estimate times of diversification in different tissues in vivo and is of importance in understanding the dynamics of the spread of HIV-1 into nonlymphoid tissues and its possible adaptation for replication in different cell types."
8123,0.002,2.0,"The frequencies of two mutations associated with the development of clinical symptoms upon infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were determined in a cohort of individuals from Moscow. Allelic frequency of the first mutation, CCR2-64I, causing the substitution of valine with isoleucine in the CCR2 chemokine receptor, was 0.1106 (95% confidence interval, 0.0714-0.1498). The frequency of the second mutation the G to A substitution in the 3'-untranslated region of the stromal-derived factor 1 encoding gene, SDF1-3'A, was 0.2125 (95% confidential interval, 0.1608-0.2642). Both values were slightly higher than those obtained earlier for Western European countries. This result can be explained by higher proportion of Asian immigrants, characterized by higher frequencies of these mutations, in the population of Moscow."
9855,0.002,2.0,"Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can result in both hepatic and extrahepatic disease and endocrine dysfunction represents an important class of HCV-related extrahepatic disease. The most frequently occurring--and clinically important--of these endocrine disorders are thyroid disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this Review, we evaluate the evidence in support of a link between HCV infection and endocrine-system dysfunction, and discuss potential pathophysiological mechanisms. A meta-analysis of the literature has revealed significant associations between chronic HCV infection, thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism. Furthermore, a high prevalence of thyroid cancer has been reported in HCV-positive patients. Several clinicoepidemiological studies have demonstrated that chronic HCV infection could lead to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, possibly as a result of HCV-induced metabolic disturbances. Some researchers have postulated that a type 1 T-helper -cell mediated immune response underpins the association of chronic HCV infection with endocrine disease. Indeed, the available data suggest that a common immunological, type 1 T-helper cell pattern of cytokine expression and activation (via interferon-gamma) could provide the pathophysiological basis for this association. Nonetheless, additional studies will be necessary to elucidate fully all the mechanisms involved in HCV-related endocrine dysfunction."
2199,0.002,2.0,"The study aimed to investigate the association of prevalent genotypes in China (HBV/C and HBV/B) with HBV drug-resistant mutations. A total of 13,847 nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA)-treated patients with chronic HBV infection from North China were enrolled. HBV genotypes and resistant mutations were determined by direct sequencing and confirmed by clonal sequencing if necessary. HBV/B, HBV/C, and HBV/D occupied 14.3%, 84.9%, and 0.8% across the study population, respectively. NA usage had no significant difference between HBV/B- and HBV/C-infected patients. Lamivudine-resistant mutations were more frequently detected in HBV/C-infected patients, compared with HBV/B-infected patients (31.67% vs. 25.26%, p < 0.01). Adefovir- and entecavir-resistant mutation detection rates were similar, but the mutational pattern was different between the two genotypes. For adefovir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtA181 V (HBV/C 5.29% vs. HBV/B 1.36%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtN236T (2.70% vs. 6.54%, p < 0.01). For entecavir-resistant mutations, HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of rtM204 V/I+T184 substitution or S202G/C (3.66% vs. 2.16%, p < 0.01) and a lower detection rate of rtM204 V/I+M250 V/I/L substitution (0.67% vs. 1.46%, p < 0.01). Multidrug-resistant mutations (defined as coexistence of mutation to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues) were detected in 104 patients. HBV/C-infected patients had a higher detection rate of multidrug-resistant mutation than HBV/B-infected patients (0.83% vs. 0.35%, p < 0.05). The study for the first time clarified that HBV/C-infected patients had a higher risk to develop multidrug-resistant mutations, compared with HBV/B-infected patients; and HBV/C- and HBV/B-infected patients had different inclinations in the ETV-resistant mutational pattern."
536,0.002,2.0,"Soluble factors with inhibitory activity against type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus The pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection is a complex process that depends on multiple factors, including viral and host immune and genetic characteristics. This leads to a variable pattern of disease progression among those HIV-1-exposed individuals who become infected, while there are a number of individuals who remain healthy and HIV-1 seronegative despite being serially exposed to HIV-1. These variable outcomes of HIV-1 exposure suggest that there are mechanisms of natural resistance to HIV-1 infection. Although several genetic and adaptive immune mechanisms of resistance have been reported in some exposed seronegative and long-term non-progressor individuals, the mechanisms involved in controlling the establishment and progression of HIV-1 infection are not fully understood. Several soluble factors, such as defensins, chemokines, interferons and ribonucleases, among others, produced by cells of the immune system and epithelial tissues, have a broad anti-viral activity that might play a role as protective mechanisms during HIV-1 exposure. A better understanding of the mechanisms and role of these soluble factors during the natural resistance to HIV-1 infection may have important implications for the design of novel therapeutic strategies to combat the morbidity and mortality associated with the HIV-1 pandemic."
4848,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B vaccination programs have prevented infection in many dialysis patients, although the antibody response to vaccination is still insufficient in approximately 50%. Reinfection or reactivation of latent hepatitis B infection (HBV) has been reported in certain groups of immunosuppressed patients, including those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). We report the reactivation or reinfection of HBV with resurgence of hepatitis B surface antigen in a dialysis patient coinfected with HIV-1. Thus, in dialysis patients with latent HBV infection, with undetectable hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels, the potential exists to reactivate during immunosuppression associated with HIV-1 infection and/or end-stage renal disease. Reinfection with a different subtype is also possible. The development of hepatitis B surface antigenemia in this patient population creates a potential for transmission in the dialysis setting. This is of special concern since the number of patients infected with HIV-1 and with evidence of prior hepatitis B infection is increasing in urban units."
7572,0.002,2.0,"Psychiatric disorders are common among people living with HIV in Nigeria. Adherence is necessary to optimise the outcome of antiretroviral therapy. In this study, we aimed to identify associations between antiretroviral adherence, measured by one-week and one-month self-reported missed doses, and psychiatric illness in a cohort previously assessed for psychiatric disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The study participants comprised 151 adults with major depression, anxiety or suicidal symptoms, and 302 matched-control participants. Two controls were randomly selected for each case within the same gender and education level. We compared participants with psychiatric disorders (WPDs) and no psychiatric disorders (NPDs) on selected demographic and clinical variables, in addition to adherence. Participants with one or more missed doses in the preceding month had twice the odds of having a major depressive episode as those with no missed doses during this period (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.03, 4.79). This association remained significant after adjusting for selected risk factors. There was no statistically significant difference between WPD and NPD groups on either one-week or one-month adherence, or on age, marital status, occupational class, HIV viral load at enrolment or current CD4 cell count. Among Nigerian adults with HIV, suboptimal antiretroviral adherence is associated with, and could be a sign of, depression. Routine self-report adherence assessments may potentially be utilised in identifying individuals at risk among this population."
2950,0.002,2.0,"The effect of coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) on immune restoration in 39 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients during treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) was prospectively evaluated. After 48 weeks of treatment, HCV-coinfected patients had lower increases in CD4% (P = .05), total CD4+ (P = .01), and naïve CD4+ (P = .06) T cells than did single-infected subjects. Higher baseline naïve CD4+ T-cell levels were associated with better CD4+ (P = .05) and naïve CD4+ (P < .001) T-cell recovery. After a 4-year follow up, the differences disappeared (median CD4+ increase: 291 and 306 cells for HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients, respectively, P = .9). No significant differences were seen in memory CD4+ T cells (P = .30), and CD8+ cells expressing CD38 (P = .10) and CD28 (P = .73). These results suggest that, independently of other factors, infection with HCV blunts early CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, as good control of viral replication is maintained, satisfactory long-term immune restoration can nonetheless be achieved."
6822,0.002,2.0,"Serial determinations of titers of binding antibodies to single stranded DNA were performed over a period of three years in 43 type B hepatitis patients with persisting HBsAg who had either developed chronic hepatitis or were asymptomatic carriers. Patients with histopathological diagnosis of chronic active or chronic persistent hepatitis, with or without clinical symptoms, showed high titers of anti-DNA throughout the course of the disease, whereas in most of these patients the serum alanine transaminase and bilirubin levels fluctuated widely and were often normal; in such cases the elevation of anti-DNA was frequently the only positive sign present. On the other hand anti-DNA titers were within the normal range in chronic asymptomatic HBsAg carriers who showed no histopathological or biochemical changes. Anti-DNA determinations are proposed as a reliable diagnostic aid to supplement current procedures for assessment of the disease status during the course of chronic hepatitis B virus infections."
9935,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes four accessory genes: vif, vpu, vpr, and nef. Recent investigations using in vitro cell culture systems have shed light on the roles of these HIV-1 accessory proteins, Vif, Vpr, Vpu, and Nef, in counteracting, modulating, and evading various cellular factors that are responsible for anti-HIV-1 intrinsic immunity. However, since humans are the exclusive target for HIV-1 infection, conventional animal models are incapable of mimicking the dynamics of HIV-1 infection in vivo. Moreover, the effects of HIV-1 accessory proteins on viral infection in vivo remain unclear. To elucidate the roles of HIV-1 accessory proteins in the dynamics of viral infection in vivo, humanized mouse models, in which the mice are xenotransplanted with human hematopoietic stem cells, has been utilized. This review describes the current knowledge of the roles of HIV-1 accessory proteins in viral infection, replication, and pathogenicity in vivo, which are revealed by the studies using humanized mouse models."
7099,0.002,2.0,"Although in Western Europe and North America the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has declined in patients awaiting renal transplantation, it remains a relevant clinical problem, mainly in patients with a long history of renal replacement therapy (RRT) who may have been infected many years ago. At the same time, a significant proportion of renal transplant recipients (RTR) is at risk for HBV infection in areas with endemic HBV. HBV infection may increase morbidity and mortality in RTR. The majority of long-term studies reported reduced patient survival compared with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative RTR. The risk for morbidity and mortality of HBsAg-positive RTR transplantation is probably related to the extent of pretransplant liver disease. A thorough evaluation, including liver biopsy in many patients, is required to assess the individual HBsAg-positive patient's risk-benefit ratio. The influence of immunosuppressive therapy on HBV replication and HBV-associated complications is not well established and for clinical practice individually tailored immunosuppression is recommended in HBsAg-positive RTR. Careful screening for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-positive RTR and a regular clinical follow-up after renal transplantation (RTX) including liver sonography is required for early detection of HBV-associated complications. With the availability of new antiviral drugs, new options for pre- and posttransplant therapy might improve the prognosis of RTR with chronic HBV infection."

Drug interactions between tenofovir and RBV were studied in vitro in order to provide insights into the safety of co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) and RBV in HCV/HIV-1-coinfected patients. In accordance with previous in vitro studies, strongly increased anti-HIV activity was observed when RBV was combined with didanosine (ddl). In contrast, low-level anti-HIV antagonism was observed when RBV was combined with either tenofovir or abacavir. Significantly stronger anti-HIV antagonism was observed when RBV was combined with either zidovudine, stavudine, emtricitabine or lamivudine. Thus, although tenofovir and ddl are both adenosine analogues, their in vitro interactions with RBV are markedly different. These results suggest a low potential for increased toxicity upon co-administration of tenofovir DF with RBV in patients."

Abdominal computed tomography scan showed a miliary hepatitis. The diagnosis of HSV-1 hepatitis was confirmed by immuno-chemistry on liver biopsy.

No major differences were found between the 2 groups with respect to achievement of a virus load of <500 copies/mL (relative risk [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-1.18), risk of clinical progression (RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.32-1.24), or response measured by total CD4+ cell count. One year after fulfilling Danish recommendations for initiation of HAART, 91% of nonwhites and 93% of whites had started receiving HAART. Race and ethnic origin play no major role in the outcome associated with HAART if access to health care is free."

We assessed the effect of following the ""when-to-start"" and ""what-to-start"" guidelines, on treatment modifications, and on immunological and virological outcome at 12 months in a cohort of HIV-1 infected patients initiating cART from 2000 to 2010."
9826,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this investigation was to analyse the impact of the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the long-term outcome of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU was undertaken. Outcomes in the pre-HAART era (1990-June 1996), early- (July 1996-2002), and recent-HAART (2003-2008) periods and total HAART era (July 1996-2008) were analysed and compared with those reported of the general population. A total of 127 ICU admissions were included. The 1-year mortality decreased from 71% in the pre-HAART era to 50% in the recent-HAART period (p = 0.06). The 5-year mortality decreased from 87% in the pre-HAART era to 59% in the early-HAART period (p = 0.005). Independent predictors of 1-year mortality in the HAART era were age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.16 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.27]), APACHE II score > 20 (6.04 [1.25-29.22]) and mechanical ventilation (40.01 [3.01-532.65]). The 5-year survival after hospitalisation was 80% and in the range of the reported survival of non-HIV-infected patients (83.7%). Predictors of 1-year mortality for HIV patients admitted to the ICU in the HAART era were all non-HIV-related. Short- and long-term outcome has improved since the introduction of HAART and is comparable to the outcome data in non-HIV-infected ICU patients."
2074,0.002,2.0,"In 1998 it seems reasonable and widely accepted that all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients willing to be treated may benefit from receiving antiretroviral therapy. Only those with undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA, normal CD4 lymphocyte counts and lack of markers of immunological system activation may be possible exceptions. The rationale supporting the early initiation of antiretroviral therapy are (i) data on viral dynamics; (ii) preliminary data pointing toward a better and a quicker restoration of immune function when treatment is initiated in very early stages (during or within a few weeks or months of acute symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV-1 infection); (iii) the lack of a stable viral load set-point even in patients in the early stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a very low viral load (< 5000 copies/ml); (iv) the relatively high likelihood of clinical progression at mid-term of the approximately 50-75% of patients in very early disease stages (CD4 > 500 cells/mm3) who have a plasma viral load above 5000 to 10,000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml; (v) data from the Spanish Earth-1 study, which used a composite endpoint (virological, immunological or clinical progression), demonstrating that even in these very early stages of HIV-1 disease any antiretroviral therapy (double or triple combination) was better than no treatment. Even in early disease stages, a triple combination is needed to achieve a durable and profound virological and immunological response. In addition, the combination of stavudine plus didanosine has several advantages and can be considered one of the best double nucleoside combinations to combine with a protease inhibitor or with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The INCAS study and the preliminary results of the ongoing Spanish SCAN study have demonstrated the possibility of protease inhibitor-sparing combinations for initial antiretroviral treatment, at least in selected patient subsets, such as those with a relatively low baseline viral load. Furthermore, components of these protease inhibitor-sparing combinations such as didanosine or nevirapine are suitable for once daily administration."
7226,0.002,2.0,"In humans, the interaction of the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D)-activating receptor on natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cells with its major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MIC) and UL16 binding protein (ULBP) ligands (NKG2DLs) promotes recognition and elimination of stressed cells, such as tumor or infected cells. Here, we investigated the capacity of HIV-1 to modulate NKG2DL expression and escape NGK2D-mediated immunosurveillance. In CD4(+) T lymphocytes, both cell surface expression and release of MICA, MICB, and ULBP2 were up-regulated >2-fold by HIV-1 infection. In HIV-infected CD4(+) T lymphocytes or Jurkat T-cell lines, increased shedding of soluble NKG2DLs (sNKG2DLs) was impaired by a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI). Moreover, naive HIV(+) patients displayed increased plasma sMICA and sULBP2 levels and reduced NKG2D expression on NK and CD8(+) T cells compared to patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or healthy donors. In individual patients, HAART uptake resulted in the drop of sNKG2DL and recovery of NKG2D expression. Finally, sNKG2DLs in patients' plasma down-regulated NKG2D on NK and CD8(+) T cells and impaired NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells. Thus, NKG2D detuning by sNKG2DLs may promote HIV-1 immune evasion and compromise host resistance to opportunistic infections, but HAART and MMPI have the potential to avoid such immune dysfunction."
9287,0.002,2.0,"Today's antiretroviral combination regimens can induce significant and sustained decreases in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-RNA levels, allowing the immune system to recover. To what extent immune reconstitution is possible and what factors determine the outcome have thus far not been resolved. We studied 19 subjects, treated for 2 years with protease inhibitor-containing triple therapy, who had a strong suppression of HIV-RNA levels. CD4+ T-cell numbers increased from medians of 170 to 420x106 cells/L, but in a number of subjects T-cell numbers did not further increase after week 72, without having reached normal values. Long-term CD4+ T-cell change was mainly caused by a slow but continuous increase in naive CD4+ T cells (CD45RA+CD62L+) and was predicted by the baseline number of these cells. Our data indicate that long-term immunological recovery is gradual, even during strong suppression of viral replication, not always complete, and dependent on the preexisting level of naive CD4+ T cells."

We systematically reviewed the treatment of chronic HCV infection in those infected with HIV. We propose that with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, patients coinfected with HCV and HIV have similar SVR rates as HCV-monoinfected persons and that DAAs address an unmet medical need in this population. A review was performed using Medical Subject Heading terms within the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases to search for studies dated between January 2004 and July 2017. Keywords used in the study included ""hepatitis C,"" ""HIV,"" ""coinfection,"" and ""direct-acting antiviral."" SVR rates for those with HCV and HIV coinfection treated with interferon-based therapies were substantially lower that SVR rates of HCV-monoinfected individuals. The advent of DAA agents has resulted in similar SVR rates between monoinfected and coinfected individuals, with SVR >93%. These medications have been demonstrated to have improved safety, efficacy, and tolerability in comparison to interferon-based regimens."
5539,0.002,2.0,"Despite HAART, a significant number of HIV-1-infected patients develop neurological complications. However, the presence of specific neurotropic HIV-1 strains, the extent of viral replication in the brain, and the type of cells infected remain controversial issues. To address this controversy we have analyzed different V3 loop sequences of viral isolates from four vertically HIV-1-infected children who developed HIV-1-related encephalopathy. Moreover, we have determined that some biological and molecular properties of HIV-1 might contribute to AIDS neurological dysfunctions. We detected very different HIV-1 isolates (X4 and R5) in the brain despite no great differences in clinical, pathological, or immunological parameters. In vitro, no differences in replicative competence in glial or neuroblastoma cells were observed between virus isolated from the blood of children with or without clinical neurological symptoms. The expression of both CXCR4 and CCR5 RNAs was observed in the brain independently of HIV-1 infection and viral strain predominant in this location. Our results failed to show a particular phenotypic property of the HIV-1 virus that might explain its neurovirulence and/or neurotropism."
6770,0.002,2.0,An increased prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report an unexpectedly high prevalence (20%) of such abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism in a population of HIV-infected patients referred for neurological evaluation. This abnormality was associated with both peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy. A majority of those treated with cyanocobalamin had a therapeutic response. Selected neuropathological results suggest a relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and vacuolar myelopathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be a frequent and treatable cause of neurological dysfunction in patients with HIV infection.
31,0.002,2.0,"HIV replication is suppressed in vitro by a CD8(+) cell noncytotoxic antiviral response (CNAR). This activity directly correlates with an asymptomatic clinical state. The objective of this study was to identify the phenotype of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity. CD8(+) cell subset frequencies and CNAR levels were measured for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected individuals and three groups of HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals: asymptomatic individuals with low-level viremia (vHIV), antiretroviral-drug-treated subjects with undetectable virus levels (TxHIV), and therapy-naïve aviremic elite controllers (EC). CD8(+) cells from the vHIV individuals exhibited the highest HIV-suppressing activity and had elevated frequencies of CD45RA(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) (CD279(+)) cells. Functional assessments of CD8(+) cells sorted into distinct subsets established that maximal CNAR activity was mediated by CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) CD27(+) and PD-1(+) CD8(+) cells. T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles of CD8(+) cell subsets having strong CNAR activity exhibited increased perturbations in comparison to those of inactive subsets. Together, these studies suggest that CNAR is driven by HIV replication and that this antiviral activity is associated with oligoclonally expanded activated CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 and having a transitional memory cell phenotype. The findings better describe the identity of CD8(+) cells showing CNAR and should facilitate the evaluation of this important immune response in studies of HIV pathogenesis, resistance to infection, and vaccine development."
8238,0.002,2.0,"The care of the HIV-infected patient in the emergency department has changed since the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy. This therapy has resulted in longer life expectancies and increased quality of life for HIV-infected patients, and in cases of treatment compliance and success, virtual elimination of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections. As a result, the emergency clinician is now more often confronted with adverse events related to medication and the diseases associated with aging and chronic disease. This issue focuses on the differences in evaluation of HIV patients on long-term therapy and patients with medication noncompliance and low CD4 counts, as well as recognition of life-threatening and rare opportunistic infections. Disease processes related to the effect of longstanding HIV infection, even with good control, on many organ systems are addressed. "
9982,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) binding induces proapoptotic signals in CD4(+) T cells without a requirement of infection. Defective virus particles, which represent the majority of HIV-1, usually contain a functional Env and therefore represent a potentially significant cause of such CD4(+)-T-cell loss. We reasoned that an HIV-1 inhibitor that prohibits Env-host cell interactions could block the destructive effects of defective particles. HIV-1 attachment inhibitors (AIs), which potently inhibit Env-CD4 binding and subsequent downstream effects of Env, display low-nanomolar antiapoptotic potency and prevent CD4(+)-T-cell depletion from mixed lymphocyte cultures, also with low-nanomolar potency. Specific Env amino acid changes that confer resistance to AI antientry activity eliminate AI antiapoptotic effects. We observed that CD4(+)-T-cell destruction is specific for CXCR4-utilizing HIV-1 strains and that the fusion blocker enfuvirtide inhibits Env-mediated CD4(+)-T-cell killing but is substantially less potent than AIs. These observations, in conjunction with observed antiapoptotic activities of soluble CD4 and the CXCR4 blocker AMD3100, suggest that this AI activity functions through a mechanism common to AI antientry activity, e.g., prevention of Env conformation changes necessary for specific interactions with cellular factors that facilitate viral entry. Our study suggests that AIs, in addition to having potent antientry activity, could contribute to immune system homeostasis in individuals infected with HIV-1 that can engage CXCR4, thereby mitigating the increased risk of adverse clinical events observed in such individuals on current antiretroviral regimens."
1574,0.002,2.0,"Medical students may have negative attitudes about persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as well as concerns about occupational infection with human immunodeficiency virus. We conducted a brief intervention to assess and modify attitudes of first-year students. The intervention was presented to small groups of students by peers, faculty, and a person with AIDS. Assessments of attitudes and knowledge were conducted one week prior to the intervention (pretest), and one (posttest 1) and 47 weeks (posttest 2) afterwards. Females had more positive attitudes about AIDS on pretest and posttest 1. Attitude scores improved significantly from pretest to posttest 1 but returned close to baseline by posttest 2. Knowledge scores were high on pretest and did not change significantly. Attitude scores were significantly correlated with knowledge, and with students' opinions regarding obligation to care for AIDS patients. Acquaintance with a homosexual was highly correlated with both scores. This intervention may serve as a model in improving students' attitudes about AIDS."
8993,0.002,2.0,"Mortality data of patients, classified according to their clinical status and CD4+ cell count status, would be very useful to guide clinicians to prioritizing patients who need antiretroviral drug therapy. In the current study, the authors re-analyzed data derived from a previously published retrospective study of HIV-1-infected individuals at Lampang Hospital in northern Thailand. According to the Cox proportional hazard model, compared to asymptomatic patients with a high CD4+ cell count (> 200 cell/microl), the mortality rate of asymptomatic patients with a medium CD4+ cell count (100-199 cell/microl) did not significantly differ. However, the mortality rate of patients with a CD4+ cell count below 100 cell/microl was at least 16 times higher, regardless of the presence of clinical symptoms. Based on these results, the authors produced a Lampang Hospital guideline of antiretroviral drug use; priority of antiretroviral therapy should, therefore, be given to patients with CD4+ cell count < 100 cell/microl."

7493,0.002,2.0,"Despite the importance of understanding the epidemiology of agents responsible for infectious diarrhea in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) population, the number of articles about this subject is relatively few. The current article summarizes published data on bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic enteropathogens in the HIV/AIDS seropositive subjects in different countries, regions and localities. In general, there is a great difference in the frequencies of etiological agents due to factors which include immune status, geographical location, climate and socioeconomic conditions. It is important to stress that a great prevalence of infection by emergent agents has been reported in the more advanced stages of AIDS. Therefore, to establish specific treatment depends directly on knowledge of these agents and risk factors associated to their distribution. Moreover, the colonization by potential pathogenic agents verified in these individuals is high thus implicating that they act as carriers. Finally, public health measures of control and prevention must take into consideration the regional previously identified enteropathogens, especially in areas where HIV prevalence is high."

7169,0.002,2.0,"Five hundred ninety students receiving primary care in a university health service were surveyed anonymously in 1985-86 to study their self-reported sexual behavior and knowledge and attitudes about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Most students (75%) were heterosexual; 3% were homosexual, 3% bisexual, and 15% had never been sexually active. Many students (32%) had greater than or equal to 2 sexual partners in the past year, but only 23% of these had changed their sexual practices because of concern about AIDS. Some students with high-risk sexual behavior were not very knowledgeable: among homosexual or bisexual men, those with greater than or equal to 6 recent sexual partners knew less than others (P less than 0.001). Overall, less knowledgeable students had more personal concerns about AIDS, favored limiting the social activities of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and favored screening for HIV-antibody; these associations between knowledge and attitudes were significant even when controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual behavior with multiple linear regression. The authors conclude that many students receiving primary care reported sexual behavior that could spread HIV, and that less knowledgeable students had particular concerns and attitudes about AIDS."

Patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may have hepatitis flares when lamivudine therapy is discontinued or when resistance of HBV to lamivudine emerges. This retrospective, descriptive study conducted in three tertiary care medical centers describes patients coinfected with HIV type 1 and HBV who presented with a spectrum of clinical and subclinical hepatitic responses to lamivudine withdrawal or resistance. One patient had fulminant hepatic failure and a second patient had subclinical hepatitis when lamivudine therapy was discontinued and a more efficacious antiretroviral regimen was substituted. Three patients had flares of hepatitis after 13 to 18 months of lamivudine therapy. Lamivudine withdrawal or emergence of lamivudine-resistant mutants in patients coinfected with HIV and HBV may result in severe hepatitis.

The study investigated the difference between a group of Chinese HIV positive (N=36) and negative (N=131) opioid dependent adults maintained on methadone treatment. Comparisons were based on their quality of life (QOL), methadone treatment adherence, adverse symptom occurrence related to methadone treatment, and HIV-related behavior changes. No significant differences were found between the two groups in age, methadone maintenance dose, methadone adherence, sex desire, and drug craving level. Participants who were HIV positive reported significantly lower scores on physical health and total health-related qualify of life. They also reported greater engagement in injection related risk behavior before methadone treatment than those who tested HIV negative. For both groups, sexual and injection risk behavior significantly decreased following initiation of methadone treatment. A regression model revealed that those infected with HIV, associated significantly with higher likelihood of reporting constipation and lack of appetite, and higher frequency of reporting abdominal pain and nausea than HIV negative patients. The primary implication of these findings is that HIV positive persons in methadone treatment may require more focused services to meet their special HIV care and substance treatment needs."

Objective To study the demographic profile of the HIV positive patients, along with their CD4 status and tuberculosis during diagnosis. Method A retrospective descriptive study carried out from May 2006 to July 2012 in 271 HIV patients registered in HIV clinic of Mahakali Zonal Hospital, Mahendranagar. Result Among 271 patients enrolled, 48.30% (131) were male and 51.7% (140) were females. Thirty seven (13.7%) were less than 15 years and 76.3% (207) were of age 16-45 years. 38.7% were household workers by occupation and 34.50% were involved in agriculture and 3.70%were migrant labour. At the time of presentation, 22.4% (60) were stage I according to WHO staging and 18.5% (50), 58.5 (158) and 0.7% (2) were of stage II, III and IV respectively. Similarly, 33.0% (89) had more than 350 CD4 count at the time of presentation. 20.8% (56) of patients were infected with tuberculosis. Among 236 families, 2 or more members were found to be affected in 24 families.

792,0.002,2.0,"Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in the assessment of severity of liver disease. Noninvasive tests have gained popularity to predict histology in view of the associated risks of biopsy. However, many models include tests not readily available, and there are limited data from patients with HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. We aimed to develop a model using routine tests to predict liver fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. A retrospective analysis of liver histology was performed in 832 patients. Liver fibrosis was assessed via Ishak score; patients were categorized as 0-1, 2-3, or 4-6 and were randomly assigned to training (n = 555) or validation (n = 277) sets. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that platelet count (PLT), age, AST, and INR were significantly associated with fibrosis. Additional analysis revealed PLT, age, AST, and ALT as an alternative model. Based on this, a simple index (FIB-4) was developed: age ([yr] x AST [U/L]) / ((PLT [10(9)/L]) x (ALT [U/L])(1/2)). The AUROC of the index was 0.765 for differentiation between Ishak stage 0-3 and 4-6. At a cutoff of <1.45 in the validation set, the negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (stage 4-6) was 90% with a sensitivity of 70%. A cutoff of >3.25 had a positive predictive value of 65% and a specificity of 97%. Using these cutoffs, 87% of the 198 patients with FIB-4 values outside 1.45-3.25 would be correctly classified, and liver biopsy could be avoided in 71% of the validation group. In conclusion, noninvasive tests can accurately predict hepatic fibrosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy in the majority of HIV/HCV-coinfected patients."
8160,0.002,2.0,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a mammalian host restriction factor that inhibits the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including retroviruses, alphaviruses and filoviruses, through interaction with the ZAP-responsive elements (ZRE) in viral RNA, and recruiting the exosome to degrade RNA substrate. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a pararetrovirus that replicates its genomic DNA via reverse transcription of a viral pregenomic (pg) RNA precursor. Here, we demonstrate that the two isoforms of human ZAP (hZAP-L and -S) inhibit HBV replication in human hepatocyte-derived cells through posttranscriptional down-regulation of viral pgRNA. Mechanistically, the zinc finger motif-containing N-terminus of hZAP is responsible for the reduction of HBV RNA, and the integrity of the four zinc finger motifs is essential for ZAP to bind to HBV RNA and fulfill its antiviral function. The ZRE sequences conferring the susceptibility of viral RNA to ZAP-mediated RNA decay were mapped to the terminal redundant region (nt 1820-1918) of HBV pgRNA. In agreement with its role as a host restriction factor and as an innate immune mediator for HBV infection, ZAP was upregulated in cultured primary human hepatocytes and hepatocyte-derived cells upon IFN-α treatment or IPS-1 activation, and in the livers of hepatitis B patients during immune active phase. Knock down of ZAP expression increased the level of HBV RNA and partially attenuated the antiviral effect elicited by IPS-1 in cell cultures. In summary, we demonstrated that ZAP is an intrinsic host antiviral factor with activity against HBV through down-regulation of viral RNA, and that ZAP plays a role in the innate control of HBV replication. Our findings thus shed light on virus-host interaction, viral pathogenesis, and antiviral approaches. "
3151,0.002,2.0,"Transient worsening of tuberculous symptomatology and lesions following antituberculous therapy (paradoxical response) has previously been described as a rare occurrence. To determine the incidence of paradoxical responses in patients with AIDS and TB who are treated with antituberculous therapy and subsequently with combination antiretroviral therapy (ARV), we conducted a prospective study of 33 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy and antiretroviral therapy (Group 1) compared with 55 HIV-seronegative TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy (Group 2) and 28 HIV-seropositive TB patients treated with anti-TB therapy but not on antiretrovirals (historical control; Group 3). In Group 1 patients, paradoxical responses were temporally more related to the initiation of ARV than to the initiation of anti-TB therapy (mean +/- SD: 15 +/- 11 d versus 109 +/- 72 d [p < 0.001]) and occurred much more frequently (12 of 33; 36%) compared with Group 2 (1 of 55; 2%) (p < 0.001) or with Group 3 (2 of 28; 7%) (p = 0.013). The majority of patients who experienced paradoxical responses and received tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) in Group 1 had their tuberculin skin tests convert from negative to strongly positive after ARV. These observations suggest that a paradoxical response associated with enhanced tuberculin skin reactivity may occur after the initiation of ARV in HIV-infected TB patients. Furthermore, the skin test conversion after the initiation of ARV may have important public health implications."
3637,0.002,2.0,"HIV protease inhibitors, as components of combination antiretroviral drug regimens, have substantially reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection. They selectively block the action of the virus-encoded protease and stop the virus from replicating. In general, these drugs have poor systemic bioavailability and must be dosed with respect to meals for optimal absorption. Protease inhibitor-containing regimens require ingestion of a large number of capsules, are costly, and produce or are susceptible to metabolic drug interactions. Simultaneous administration of two protease inhibitors takes advantage of beneficial pharmacokinetic interactions and may circumvent many of the drugs' undesirable pharmacologic properties. For example, ritonavir increases saquinavir concentrations at steady state by up to 30-fold, allowing reduction of saquinavir dose and dosing frequency. Ritonavir decreases the systemic clearance of indinavir and overcomes the deleterious effect of food on indinavir bioavailability. These benefits reflect inhibition of presystemic clearance and first-pass metabolism, as well as inhibition of systemic clearance mediated by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4. Several dual protease inhibitor combination regimens have shown great promise in clinical trials and are now recommended as components of salvage therapy for HIV-infected patients."
2021,0.002,2.0,"The effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy on cytokine imbalances associated with HIV-1 infection have not been characterized. Using single cell analysis by flow cytometry, we show that a significant recovery in the frequency of IL-2-producing cells was only observed in patients with a sustained control of viral replication and that the overexpanded CD8 T cell population of CD28- IFN-gamma + cells was not significantly reduced after 1 yr of effective therapy. Moreover, a detrimental role of IL-4 is suggested by the association between an enhanced proportion of IL-4-producing cells within the CD4 and particularly the CD8 subset and viral load rebound. Finally, the kinetics of changes of cell subsets assessed for simultaneous production of different cytokines supports the view that cell reconstitution during highly active antiretroviral therapy is initially due to redistribution of terminally differentiated cells, followed by peripheral expansion of less differentiated ones and a late progressive increase of the proportion of functionally defined naive/memory precursor lymphocytes. These data bring new support for the role of cytokine imbalances in AIDS pathogenesis and may be relevant for the definition of immunointervention targets."
9071,0.002,2.0,"CD4+ T cells of patients with AIDS exhibit a qualitative defect in their ability to respond to soluble antigen while their responses to mitogens remain normal. CD4+ T cells can be broadly divided phenotypically into ""naive"" [CD45RA+ (2H4+)] and ""memory"" [CD29+ (4B4+) or CD45RO+ (UCHL1+)] cell subpopulations, which represent distinct maturation stages. To determine the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infectability of memory and naive CD4+ T-cell subsets in vitro and to determine the in vivo preference of HIV-1 in these subpopulations, we obtained highly purified CD4+ T-cell subsets from normal and HIV-1-infected individuals and studied them by viral cultivation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and functional assays. Polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that the memory cell subset of CD4+ T cells is preferentially infected (4- to 10-fold more than naive T cells) by HIV-1 in vitro, and these memory cells are the principal reservoir for HIV-1 within CD4+ T cells obtained from infected individuals. Functional abnormalities attributable to CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals (failure to respond in vitro to soluble antigen or to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies) were shown to reside primarily within these memory cells. Thus, the present study suggests that the selective functional defects present in the memory CD4+ T-cell subset of HIV-infected individuals may be a direct result of the preferential infection and consequently greater viral burden within these cells."
7709,0.002,2.0,"The male and female genital tracts are protected by a local immune system that displays features distinguishing them from other mucosal sites. In contrast to the intestinal tract, where locally produced IgA is the dominant Ig, secretions of the male and female genital tract contain predominantly IgG of both local and systemic origin. Genital tract tissues also lack mucosal lymphoepithelial inductive sites analogous to intestinal Peyer's patches; consequently, local immunization or infections with sexually transmitted pathogens induce low immune responses. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection must be primarily considered as a mucosal disease with extensive involvement of the systemic immune compartment. Although the majority of infections is acquired through the genital mucosa, a high rate of virus replication and profound CD4(+) T cell depletion occurs in the intestinal mucosa and other mucosal tissues shortly after infection. Evaluation of HIV-specific antibodies in sera and external secretions, including vaginal washes and semen, unexpectedly revealed a selective lack of IgA responses. Moreover, specific antibody-secreting cells in peripheral blood were of the IgG isotype, even in mucosally infected individuals. Whether humoral responses to previously or newly encountered antigens are compromised in HIV-1-infected persons is under current investigation."
9181,0.002,2.0,"A total of 390 parenteral drug abusers (PDAs) at the Kaohsiung Municipal Narcotics Abstention Institute were examined for markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), surface antibody (anti-HBs), and core antibody (anti-HBc) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and for antibody to HIV (anti-HIV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) were also tested for HBsAg-positive serum samples. Although the HBsAg-positive rate (22.1%) among PDAs was similar to that of the general population in southern Taiwan, the HBV infection rate (99.2%) and the anti-HDV-positive rate (78.5%) among HBsAg-positive subjects were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). None of the PDAs studied were positive for anti-HIV. The levels of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) among PDAs were significantly higher than those of the general population in southern Taiwan (P less than 0.0001). The more frequent the institutionalisation, the higher the infection rates with HBV and HDV and elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT. Horizontal transmission through parenteral drug abuse may be considered a possible reason for the significantly higher rates of HBV and HDV among parenteral drug abusers."

4804,0.002,2.0,"CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. In this study, we have developed, characterized, verified, and prevalidated a novel phenotypic test to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism (VERITROP) based on a sensitive cell-to-cell fusion assay. A proprietary vector was constructed containing a near-full-length HIV-1 genome with the yeast uracil biosynthesis (URA3) gene replacing the HIV-1 env coding sequence. Patient-derived HIV-1 PCR products were introduced by homologous recombination using an innovative yeast-based cloning strategy. The env-expressing vectors were then used in a cell-to-cell fusion assay to determine the presence of R5 and/or non-R5 HIV-1 variants within the viral population. Results were compared with (i) the original version of Trofile (Monogram Biosciences, San Francisco, CA), (ii) population sequencing, and (iii) 454 pyrosequencing, with the genotypic data analyzed using several bioinformatics tools, i.e., the 11/24/25 rule, Geno2Pheno (2% to 5.75%, 3.5%, or 10% false-positive rate [FPR]), and webPSSM. VERITROP consistently detected minority non-R5 variants from clinical specimens, with an analytical sensitivity of 0.3%, with viral loads of ≥1,000 copies/ml, and from B and non-B subtypes. In a pilot study, a 73.7% (56/76) concordance was observed with the original Trofile assay, with 19 of the 20 discordant results corresponding to non-R5 variants detected using VERITROP and not by the original Trofile assay. The degree of concordance of VERITROP and Trofile with population and deep sequencing results depended on the algorithm used to determine HIV-1 coreceptor tropism. Overall, VERITROP showed better concordance with deep sequencing/Geno2Pheno at a 0.3% detection threshold (67%), whereas Trofile matched better with population sequencing (79%). However, 454 sequencing using Geno2Pheno at a 10% FPR and 0.3% threshold and VERITROP more accurately predicted the success of a maraviroc-based regimen. In conclusion, VERITROP may promote the development of new HIV coreceptor antagonists and aid in the treatment and management of HIV-infected individuals prior to and/or during treatment with this class of drugs."

The patient received combination of interferon-alpha2b (5 MU three times a week) plus ribavirin (1000 mg daily) for three months. Aminotransferase levels were normalised and clearance of HCV RNA was obtained in the first month of the therapy. After 19 months of follow-up, he had undetectable levels of HCV RNA so sustained response (clearance of HCV RNA and normalisation of aminotransferases at least six months after cessation of therapy) was achieved.

Clearance rates of HIV RNA and HIV DNA in peripheral blood as well as the preexistence and the emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV were determined over 52 weeks of treatment. The data indicate that HAART is able to induce a suppression of plasma viral load together with a significant decrease, but not a suppression, of peripheral blood mononuclear cell-associated proviral DNA in PHI subjects. Analysis of drug-resistant strains revealed that three PHI patients, showing a complete virologic response, developed mutations in the pol gene, thus suggesting that a persistent residual virus replication exists despite a sustained suppression of plasma viremia."
8581,0.002,2.0,"Based on gold label silver stain and coupled with multiplex asymmetric polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, we developed the visual DNA microarray for simultaneous, sensitive, and specific detection of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and Treponema pallidum. The 5'-end amino-modified oligonucleotides were immobilized on glass surface, which were used as the capturing probes to bind the complement biotinylated target DNA. The gold-conjugated streptavidins were introduced to the microarray for specific binding to biotin. The black image of microarray spots, which were the result from the precipitation of silver onto nanogold particles and bound to streptavidins, was visualized and accounted as the detection of biotinylated target DNA. Multiplex asymmetric PCR products of HIV-1 and T. pallidum and Bacillus subtilis (used as positive control) were performed for preparing the abundant biotinylated single-stranded target DNA of which could affect detection efficiency and sensitivity of hybridization on microarray. One hundred sixty-nine clinical samples of HIV-1 and T. pallidum from infected patients were tested using the homemade DNA microarrays. The results were identical to those shown in the assays of ELISA and fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR. Our results demonstrate that we have developed the visual gene detection technique, which is of high sensitivity and specificity; it may have potential in clinical applications."
7948,0.002,2.0,"We examined the emergence of CXCR4 (i.e., X4) tropism in 67 male human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconverters from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) who were selected to reflect the full spectrum of rates of HIV-1 disease progression. A mean of 10 serial samples per donor were evaluated by a laboratory-validated, commercially available assay to determine phenotypic coreceptor use. A total of 52% of men had dual- or mixed-tropic HIV-1 detected at 1 or more of the time points tested. Use of X4 by HIV-1 was detected more frequently among men who developed AIDS (defined as a CD4(+) T cell count of <200 cells/muL and/or an AIDS-defining illness) < or =11 years after seroconversion than among those who did not (P = .005), as well as among men who exhibited a total T cell count decline (i.e., a CD3(+) inflection point), compared with those who did not (P = .03). For men in whom both X4 virus and an inflection point were detected, emergence of X4 virus preceded the inflection point by a median of 0.83 years. The median CD4(+) T cell count at first detection of X4 viruses before the onset of AIDS was 475 cells/microL. We conclude that HIV-1 variants that used X4 frequently emerged at high CD4(+) T cell counts and may contribute to the decrease in T cell numbers during late HIV-1 infection."
6241,0.002,2.0,"The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists as anti-human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV) therapeutics has highlighted the need to accurately identify CXCR4-using variants in patient samples when use of this new drug class is considered. The Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) has become the method that is the most widely used to define tropism in the clinic prior to the use of a CCR5 antagonist. By comparison, the MT-2 assay has been used since early in the HIV epidemic to define tropism in clinical specimens. Given that there are few data from direct comparisons of these two assays, we evaluated the performance of the plasma-based Trofile assay and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-based MT-2 assay for the detection of CXCR4 use in defining the tropism of HIV isolates derived from clinical samples. The various samples used for this comparison were derived from participants of the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV infection and AIDS who underwent consecutive MT-2 assay testing of their PBMCs at approximately 3-month intervals. This unique sample set was specifically selected because consecutive MT-2 assays had demonstrated a shift from negative to positive in PBMCs, reflecting the first emergence of CXCR4-using virus in PBMCs above the level of detection of the assay in these individuals. Trofile testing was performed with clonal HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (n = 21), MT-2 cell culture-derived cells (n = 20) and supernatants (n = 42), and plasma samples (n = 76). Among the clonal HIV-1 variants and MT-2 cell culture-derived samples, the results of the Trofile and MT-2 assays demonstrated a high degree of concordance (95% to 98%). Among consecutive plasma samples, detection of CXCR4-using virus was at or before the time of first detection by the MT-2 assay in 5/10 patients by the original Trofile assay and in 9/10 patients by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay. Differences in the time to the first detection of CXCR4 use between the MT-2 assay (PBMCs) and the original Trofile assay (plasma) were greatly reduced by the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile assay, suggesting that sensitivity for the detection of minor CXCR4-using variants may be a more important determinant of discordant findings than compartmentalization. The similarities in performance of the enhanced-sensitivity Trofile and MT-2 assays suggest that either may be an appropriate methodology to define tropism in patient specimens."

Patients were interviewed on risk factors and provided oral-rinse samples for HPV DNA typing by polymerase chain reaction. Statistical associations were assessed by logistic regression. Oral HPV was prevalent in 32% and 16% of HIV-positive patients and HIV-negative patients, respectively, including high-risk HPV type 16 (8% and 2%, respectively; P = .049) and uncommon HPV types 32/42 (6% and 5%, respectively; P = .715). Among HIV-negative patients, significant risk factors for oral HPV included multiple sex partners (≥21 vs ≤5; odds ratio [OR], 9.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-49.3), heavy tobacco smoking (>20 pack-years vs none; OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.4-59.4), and marijuana use (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.3-12.4). Among HIV-positive patients, lower CD4(+) T-cell count only was associated with oral HPV detection (≤200 vs ≥500 cells/mm(3); OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.3-15.5). Detection of high-risk HPV was also associated with concurrent detection of potentially cancerous oral lesions among HIV-negative patients but not among HIV-positive patients. The observed risk factor associations with oral HPV in HIV-negative patients are consistent with sexual transmission and local immunity, whereas in HIV-positive patients, oral HPV detection is strongly associated with low CD4(+) T-cell counts.

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is considered as an important potential risk factors for HCC. Different people have diverse responses to HBV infection regarding the likelihood of HCC development, and host factors such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might account for this. The present study was conducted to evaluate any association between SNP frequencies in two genes, XRCC4 (rs1805377) and ATF6 (rs2070150), and the risk of CHB and HCC development in Thai patients. The study covered 369 subjects including 121 HCC patients, 141 with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) and 107 healthy controls. With TaqMan real-time PCR, the results showed that no significant association between XRCC4 (rs1805377) and ATF6 (rs2070150) and risk of HCC in the Thai population. From this first study of the 2 polymorphisms and HCC in Thailand it can concluded that rs1805377 and rs2070150 polymorphisms may not be applicable as genetic markers in the Thai population for HCC assessment.

5752,0.002,2.0,"No data on antiviral response of HBV genotypes E-H are available so far although these HBV genotypes contribute significantly to the global HBV burden. Of 49 patients with HBV genotypes E-H, 23 received interferon (IFN)-alpha, 12 nucleos(t)ide analogues and 14 patients were untreated. HBV genotype was determined by direct sequencing of the HBV S gene. Sustained virological response in IFN-treated patients was defined as normalization of ALT and decrease of HBV-DNA <4,000 IU/ml 6 months after treatment. Virological response with nucleos(t)ide analogues was assumed in patients with a HBV-DNA <200 IU/ml after 48 weeks of treatment. HBV genotype E was found in 61.2% (n = 30), HBV genotype F in 8.2% (n = 4), HBV genotype H in 10.2% (n = 5) of patients. Among patients with HBV genotype G (20.4%; n = 10) there were four HBV genotype G/A and three HBV genotype G/C co-infections. Patients had Caucasian (43%), African (55%), or Asian (2%) background. End of treatment response was 70% (16/23) and sustained virological response was 35% (8/23) for patients treated with IFN-alpha. Sustained virological response was 36% for HBV genotype E (n = 5/14), 50% for HBV genotype F or H (n = 2/4), and 20% for HBV genotype G (n = 1/5). Virus suppression at week 48 was achieved in 67% of patients treated with nucleos(t)ide analogues. According to the present preliminary data HBV genotypes E, F, and H appear to be sensitive to IFN-alpha. Lower rates of response to IFN-alpha in patients with HBV genotype G might be related to the frequent occurrence of double infection."

When the U5 ribozyme was placed into the HIV-1 genome, virus replication was suppressed in tissue culture. Introduction of this ribozyme into cells by using an amphotropic retrovirus vector significantly reduced expression of U5-containing RNA in cells chronically infected with HIV-1.

CMV has been the most common opportunistic infection associated with AIDS and the leading cause of blindness among AIDS patients. There have been early indications of a widespread fall in CMV prevalence internationally following the introduction of a new highly active antiretroviral triple (HAART) therapy. Our study sought to assess the position for Ireland. Our cohort was the entire population of stage IV AIDS patients attending the country's leading referral centre. The total number of patients examined was 167 and the period of examination was 1 May 1995 to 30 April 1997. HAART was introduced in March 1996, so the data permitted a 'before and after' comparison of various clinical findings. The incidence of new CMV cases was found to be 4 among the 102 patients examined in the first 12-month period and one among 107 patients examined in the second 12-month period. There were accompanying declines in HIV-related noninfectious retinal vasculopathy (HIVR), keratitis and other conditions. The findings are promising, but we argue that caution is needed in assessing long-term trends. In the paper we discuss a number of methodological issues in the collection and analysis of the clinical data and in the interpretation of results."

The study population included 218 MSM who were screened for HCV infection during routine clinic visits from May through December, 2001. Eighty-four percent of those screened (n = 183) agreed to complete a self-report questionnaire assessing drug use, sexual practices, and medical history. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 54 years. The majority of participants (82%) self-identified as Caucasian and 35% were HIV-positive. Prevalence of HCV infection was 11.5%. Men infected with HCV were more likely than HCV uninfected men to be coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B, and to have a history of rectal or urethral gonorrhea. HCV-infected men were more likely to have seen blood on shared cocaine straws and to have used crack cocaine in the past 6 months. Overall, 12% of HCV-infected men reported no parenteral risk factors for HCV infection. HCV seropositivity was significantly associated with an aggregate score representing high-risk behavior in the past six months. HCV prevention and screening should target MSM engaging in high-risk sex. Conversely, HIV and sexually transmitted infection risk reduction interventions should be targeted at MSM with HCV."
850,0.002,2.0,"Patients undergoing treatment at a community-based renal dialysis clinic were monitored monthly for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Of 160 patients who began treatment HBsAg(-)/anti-HBs(-), 77 subsequently became HBsAg(+). Once HBsAg(+), males were more likely to remain HBsAg(+) indefinitely, whereas females were more likely to convert to HBsAg(-) and develop anti-HBs. This was not due to a sex difference in exposure to hepatitis B virus because only patients who became infected while undergoing treatment were included in the analysis. These data are clear evidence of a sex difference in response to hepatitis B virus, which may partially explain the greater incidence of several chronic liver diseases, including primary hepatocellular carcinoma, in males."
7726,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the aetiologic agent of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in most countries and probably originated in Central Africa like the AIDS epidemic itself. Evidence for a second major group of human immunodeficiency-associated retroviruses came from a report that West African human populations like wild-caught African green monkeys had serum antibodies that reacted more strongly with a simian immunodeficiency virus (STLV-3Mac) (ref.6) than with HIV-1. Novel T-lymphotropic retroviruses were reported to have been isolated from healthy Senegalese West Africans (HTLV-4) (ref. 4) and from African green monkeys (STLV-3AGM) (ref. 7), and a different retrovirus (HIV-2) was identified in other West African AIDS patients. Genomic analysis of HIV-2 clearly distinguished it from STLV-3 (ref. 9), but restriction enzyme site-mapping of three different HTLV-4 isolates and six different STLV-3AGM isolates showed them to be essentially indistinguishable. In this report we clone, restriction map, and partially sequence three isolates of HTLV-4 (PK82, PK289, PK190) (ref. 4). We find that these viruses differ in nucleotide sequence from each other and from three isolates of STLV-3AGM (K78, K6W, K1) (ref. 7) by 1% or less. We also report the isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from the peripheral blood of a healthy Senegalese woman which hybridizes preferentially to HIV-2 specific DNA probes. We conclude that HTLV-4 (ref. 4) and STLV-3AGM (ref. 7) are not independent virus isolates and that HIV-2 is present in Senegal as it is in other West African countries."

In West Bengal, only two hepatitis E outbreaks have been studied to date. However, sporadic cases of HEV infection also occur during inter-epidemic periods. The aim of this hospital-based study was to detect the prevalence of HEV infection in patients with acute sporadic hepatitis in West Bengal, India. Blood samples and clinical information were collected from 285 patients of both sexes and different ages with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) at Calcutta Medical College, Kolkata, a tertiary-care centre. Samples were tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen, anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies, anti-hepatitis A virus IgM and anti-HEV antibodies (IgM and IgG) by ELISA. Only those patients with AVH who were in their first week of illness and negative for all hepatotropic viral antibodies were tested for HEV RNA by reverse transcriptase nested PCR. HEV was identified as the most common cause of AVH (41.8% of patients), followed by HBV (21.4%), hepatitis A virus (17.2%) and hepatitis C virus (4.6%). Co-infections with more than one virus were found in 22 patients, with HBV-HEV the most common co-infection (3.8%). Only 14.7% of patients had no viral marker. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented epidemiological study of acute sporadic hepatitis with HEV in the state of West Bengal, India, indicating that this state is an endemic zone for HEV infection."

Using HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific enzyme immunoassays and confirmatory Western blot analysis to test for antibodies to SIVsm-related lentiviruses, we found only nine subjects (0.096%) who tested positive for HIV: seven tested positive for HIV-1 and two tested positive for HIV-2. Compared with other rural West African communities, Sierra Leone displayed the lowest seroprevalence (0.021%) of HIV-2 infection yet reported, much lower than the previously reported seroprevalence in SIVsm-infected feral and household pet sooty mangabeys. Heteroduplex analysis demonstrated that two of the newly found HIV-1 strains belonged to subtype A, the most common HIV-1 subtype in Africa, but this is the first report of subtype A in Sierra Leone. The two HIV-2-infected individuals harbored two distinct HIV-2 strains, designated 93SL1 and 93SL2. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HIV-2 93SL1 is a member of HIV-2 subtype A, the first strain of this HIV-2 subtype found in Sierra Leone. In contrast, HIV-2 93SL2 belongs to none of the five previously characterized HIV-2 subtypes (A to E) but is a new subtype, herein designated F, having the most divergent transmembrane sequences yet reported for HIV-2. The fact that both of the two most divergent HIV-2 subtypes known, E and F, are rare and found as single occurrences in persons from Sierra Leone may be related to the fact that this small region of West Africa also contains free-living and household pet sooty mangabeys with highly divergent variants of SIVsm. This finding provides support for the hypotheses that new HIV-2 subtypes result from independent cross-species transmission of SIVsm to the human population and that these single-occurrence transmission events had not spread widely into the population by 1993."

9632,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and the associated disease AIDS are a major cause of human death worldwide with no vaccine or cure available. The trafficking of HIV-1 RNAs from sites of synthesis in the nucleus, through the cytoplasm, to sites of assembly at the plasma membrane are critical steps in HIV-1 viral replication, but are not well characterized. Here we present a broadly accessible microscopy method that captures multiple focal planes simultaneously, which allows us to image the trafficking of HIV-1 genomic RNAs with high precision. This method utilizes a customization of a commercial multichannel emission splitter that enables high-resolution 3D imaging with single-macromolecule sensitivity. We show with high temporal and spatial resolution that HIV-1 genomic RNAs are most mobile in the cytosol, and undergo confined mobility at sites along the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus and nucleolus. These provide important insights regarding the mechanism by which the HIV-1 RNA genome is transported to the sites of assembly of nascent virions. "
3496,0.002,2.0,"The pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction associated with human immunodeficiency (HIV)-1 infection is uncertain. However, the presence of macrophage infiltrates in the central nervous system is a key feature of HIV encephalitis and is correlated with HIV-associated dementia. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages can produce toxic substances that may play a critical role in the development of HIV-associated dementia. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for HIV infection and leukocyte recruitment to the central nervous system remain speculative. Similar to HIV-infected patients, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque monkeys develop immunosuppression and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related inflammatory disorders, including AIDS encephalitis. In this study, we demonstrate that encephalitic brain from SIV-infected animals has elevated immunohistochemical expression of the C-C chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha and -beta, RANTES, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3, and the C-X-C chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10. These findings suggest that one or all of of these chemokines could be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the brain in SIV-infected macaque monkeys."
4466,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a major health issue worldwide. Several factors including core gene variation are responsible for the development of chronicity of HBV infection. The present study was designed to identify the variations in the core region of the HBV genome in a local population of chronic hepatitis B patients (n = 57) using a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Fifty subjects were found to be positive for the presence of HBV DNA. For the core region genotyping, the Ava II and Msp I restriction enzymes were used. Mutations at nucleotide (nt) 2147 and nt 2362 in the HBV genome in the core region for Ava II (A4 type, 74%) and nt 2331 for Msp I (M1 type, 66%) were observed as the most common pattern. These results are different from those of previously reported studies on other populations and thus appear to be unique to the Pakistani population. This type of characterization of core mutants may be useful for the design of vaccines based on viral epitopes that are effective for the Pakistani population. Moreover, these unique genotypic patterns for the HBV core gene might be some of the main factors responsible for understanding the underlying mechanism by which HBV chronicity is developed in the Pakistani population."
4102,0.002,2.0,"Viral mutations have been implicated in alteration of the biological phenotype of hepatitis B virus (HBV). We recently cloned and sequenced the viral genome of an HBV strain associated with an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis (FH strain). The FH strain contained numerous mutations in all genomic regions and was functionally characterized by a more efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA leading to highly enhanced replication. To define the responsible mutation(s) for the enhanced replication, we introduced individual mutations of the FH strain into a wild-type construct by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Analysis of viral replication showed that two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor (C to T at nucleotide 1768 and T to A at nucleotide 1770) led to high level replication. Similar to the FH strain, this mutant displayed the phenotype of enhanced encapsidation of pregenomic RNA. Functional studies in an encapsidation assay demonstrated that the identified mutations resulted in a minor increase of pregenomic RNA transcription (two- to threefold) and a major transcription-independent enhancement (> 10-fold) of viral encapsidation. Our results demonstrate that the two adjacent mutations in the HBV core promotor region are responsible for the enhanced replication of the FH strain. These two mutations, outside the previously described encapsidation signal, core, and polymerase polypeptides, appeared to affect a novel genetic element involved in viral encapsidation."
4887,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B is characterized by an impaired immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV). Telbivudine treatment has significantly improved the clinical outcome of chronic HBV infection. However, the underlying mechanism behind the antiviral response of patients treated with nucleoside analogs remains unclear. To gather more evidence about the mechanism responsible for the weak immune response, in this study we analyzed the effects on HBV viral load of treatment with the nucleoside analogue telbivudine and the percentage of Tregs, programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and related cytokine production. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum of 28 patients with chronic hepatitis B were collected at baseline, and 3 mo and 6 mo after therapy was begun. In parallel with the decline in viral load and serum ALT normalization, we found a decline in circulating CD4(+)CD25(high) Tregs, PD-L1 on CD4(+) T cells, and IL-9 production. The expression of PD-1 on CD4(+) T cells and the production of IFN-γ did not increase during therapy. Our findings suggest that the antiviral effect of the nucleoside analogs may be attributable not only to their direct effect on virus suppression, but also to their immunoregulatory capabilities."

7198,0.002,2.0,"The protease (PR) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is essential for viral replication: this aspartyl protease, active only as a dimer, is responsible for cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors (Gag and Gag-Pol), to release the functional mature proteins. In this work, we have studied the structure-function relationships of the HIV PR by combining a genetic test to detect proteolytic activity in Escherichia coli and a bacterial two-hybrid assay to analyze PR dimerization. We showed that a drug-resistant PR variant isolated from a patient receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is impaired in its dimerization capability and, as a consequence, is proteolytically inactive. We further showed that the polypeptide regions adjacent to the PR coding sequence in the Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor, and in particular, the transframe polypeptide (TF), located at the N terminus of PR, can facilitate the dimerization of this variant PR and restore its enzymatic activity. We propose that the TF protein could help to compensate for folding and/or dimerization defects in PR arising from certain mutations within the PR coding sequence and might therefore function to buffer genetic variations in PR."

1734,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the population of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals from Slovenia and Croatia was determined. One hundred and sixty-six out of a total of 188 Slovenian HIV-1-infected individuals and 120 subjects who were randomly chosen out of a total 342 Croatian HIV-1 antibodies-positive individuals were tested for HCV infection. Detection of HCV antibodies was carried out by a third generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and the positive samples were additionally tested by a third generation immuno-blot assay. Additionally, the presence of HCV RNA was determined in all serum samples by a qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-four (14.5%) out of 166 Slovenian and 18 (15.0%) out of 120 Croatian HIV-1-infected individuals were HCV antibodies-positive. Nineteen out of 24 (79.2%) Slovenian and 13 out of 18 (72.2%) Croatian anti-HCV positive individuals were also viremic. HCV RNA was not detected in any of 244 HCV antibodies-negative/HIV-1-infected individual from both countries. A significant difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between blood (77.8% in Slovenia and 66.7% in Croatia) and sexual exposure risk groups (1.6% in Slovenia and 6.6% in Croatia) was found in both countries. In a study carried out on the highest proportion of entire population of HIV-1-infected individuals from a certain country or geographic region, Slovenia and Croatia were identified as countries with the second and third lowest prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-1/HIV-2 infected individuals worldwide."
177,0.002,2.0,"The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission following a bite injury is important to many groups of people. The first are those who are likely to be bitten as an occupational risk, such as police officers and institutional staff. Another group are represented by the victims and perpetrators of crimes involving biting, both in attack and defense situations. The possibility of these bites transmitting a potentially fatal disease is of interest to the physicians who treat such patients and the legal system which may have to deal with the repercussions of such a transmission. Bite injuries represent 1% of all emergency department admissions in the United States, and human bites are the third most common following those of dogs and cats. The worldwide epidemic of HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) continues, with >5 million new cases last year and affecting 1 in 100 sexually active adults. A review of the literature concerning human bites, HIV and AIDS, HIV in saliva, and case examples was performed to examine the current opinion regarding the transmission of HIV via this route. A bite from an HIV-seropositive individual that breaks the skin or is associated with a previous injury carries a risk of infection for the bitten individual."
6983,0.002,2.0,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are prevalent worldwide, and share similar means of transmission. These infections may influence each other in evolution and outcome, including cancer or immunodeficiency. Many studies have reported the influence of genetic markers on the host immune response against different persistent viral infections, such as HTLV-1 infection, pointing to the importance of the individual genetic background on their outcomes. However, despite recent advances on the knowledge of the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection, gaps in the understanding of the role of the individual genetic background on the progress to disease clinically manifested still remain. In this scenario, much less is known regarding the influence of genetic factors in the context of dual or triple infections or their influence on the underlying mechanisms that lead to outcomes that differ from those observed in monoinfection. This review describes the main factors involved in the virus-host balance, especially for some particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes, and other important genetic markers in the development of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and other persistent viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

840,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Both advanced solid tumors and HCV have previously been associated with memory B-cell dysfunction. In this study, we sought to dissect the effect of viral infection, cirrhosis, and liver cancer on memory B-cell frequency and function in the spectrum of HCV disease. Peripheral blood from healthy donors, HCV-infected patients with F1-F2 liver fibrosis, HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis, patients with HCV-related HCC, and non-HCV-infected cirrhotics were assessed for B-cell phenotype by flow cytometry. Isolated B cells were stimulated with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)40 antibodies and Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 agonist for assessment of costimulation marker expression, cytokine production, immunoglobulin (Ig) production, and CD4(+) T-cell allostimulatory capacity. CD27(+) memory B cells and, more specifically, CD27(+) IgM(+) B cells were markedly less frequent in cirrhotic patients independent of HCV infection. Circulating B cells in cirrhotics were hyporesponsive to CD40/TLR9 activation, as characterized by CD70 up-regulation, tumor necrosis factor beta secretion, IgG production, and T-cell allostimulation. Last, blockade of TLR4 and TLR9 signaling abrogated the activation of healthy donor B cells by cirrhotic plasma, suggesting a role for bacterial translocation in driving B-cell changes in cirrhosis."
399,0.002,2.0,"Hepatic expression of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) was examined by immunohistochemistry in 90 Chinese patients (M/F 67:23, age: 14-69) with a spectrum of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related chronic liver diseases. Immunoreactive IFN-alpha was detected in sinusoidal cells in 79 patients (88%) and in mononuclear cells in 59 patients (65.6%). Patients with active liver diseases (chronic active hepatitis, active cirrhosis, N = 55) had a higher level of IFN-alpha expression compared to patients with inactive histology (N = 35; sinusoidal cells, P < 0.01; mononuclear cells, P < 0.01). Cytoplasmic HBsAg, nuclear HBcAg, and cytoplasmic HBcAg were detected in 79 (88%), 42 (47%), and 23 (27%) patients respectively. Expression of IFN-alpha in mononuclear cells correlated with the expression of cytoplasmic HBcAg (P < 0.05) but not with nuclear HBcAg or cytoplasmic HBsAg. When the patients were divided into four different phases according to the natural history of chronic HBV infection, patients in the active liver disease phase had higher IFN-alpha expression compared to the immunotolerant and late phase patients (P < 0.01). Using double immunohistochemical staining, both IFN-alpha and cytoplasmic HBcAg were frequently detected near inflammatory infiltrates but no correlation existed between the hepatic expression of HBsAg and IFN-alpha. These data indicate that IFN-alpha is expressed in the liver in HBV-related active liver diseases and that the reported suboptimal production of IFN-alpha by PBMC in HBV-related chronic active liver diseases may be due to a redistribution of the IFN-alpha-producing mononuclear cells into the liver, the site of inflammation."
4588,0.002,2.0,"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) may be associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This was studied further in two parts. First, 1,151 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and 181 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis, well matched for age, sex, and severity of cirrhosis, were reviewed retrospectively. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was higher in HCV-related cirrhosis (23.6%) than in HBV-related cirrhosis (9.4%; odds ratio [OR], 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-4.79; P =.0002). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was associated closely with the Child-Pugh score (OR, 3.83; 95% CI, 2. 38-6.17; P <.0001) and increasing age (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; P =.0117). Second, 235 patients with biopsy confirmed chronic HBV or HCV underwent an oral glucose tolerance test. Only 1 of 70 patients with chronic viral hepatitis without cirrhosis was diabetic. However, 31 of 127 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (24.4%) were diabetic compared with 3 of 38 patients with HBV-related cirrhosis (7.9%, P =.0477). The major variables associated with NIDDM were cirrhosis (OR, 14.39; 95% CI, 1.91-108; P =.0096) and male sex (OR, 4.64; 95% CI, 1. 32-16.18; P =.0161). Fasting insulin levels in 30 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus were elevated significantly, which was consistent with insulin resistance. However, acute insulin responsiveness was reduced in all patients with HCV infection and diabetes suggesting concomitant B-cell dysfunction. This study confirms an association between HCV and NIDDM."
6698,0.002,2.0,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reduces the mortality of persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it does not eliminate HIV reservoirs. In this study, which used a 6-thioguanine (6-TG) resistant clone (4C6) of the MT-2 cell line as a model, the combination of 6-TG with both reverse-transcriptase (RT) inhibitor and protease inhibitor or 6-TG with a protease inhibitor alone completely eradicated HIV-1-carrying cells from the culture and protected uninfected 4C6 cells from HIV-1 infection. The combination of 6-TG and a RT inhibitor, azidothymidine, provided partial protection. Protection was extended to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results suggest that adding a cytotoxic drug in combination antiviral chemotherapy may reduce the establishment of virus reservoirs and prevent virus spread. The clinical value of this and similar strategies should be further evaluated in HIV-infected patients."
9069,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor-resistant variants, isolated on passage of HIV-1HXB2 in MT-4 cells with five different protease inhibitors, have been examined for cross-resistance to five inhibitors. The protease inhibitors studied were Ro 31-8959, A-77003, XM323, L-735,524, and VX-478. Resistant variants with two to four mutations within their protease sequence and 9- to 40-fold-decreased susceptibility were selected for all five inhibitors within six to eight passes in cell culture. Passage of a zidovudine-resistant mutant in Ro 31-8959 generated a dual reverse transcriptase- and protease-resistant virus. Variants were cloned directly into a modified pHXB2-D infectious clone for cross-resistance analysis. Although the resistant variants selected possessed different combinations of protease mutations for each inhibitor, many showed cross-resistance to the other inhibitors, and one showed cross-resistance to all five inhibitors. Interestingly, some mutants showed increased susceptibility to some inhibitors. Further HIV passage studies in the combined presence of two protease inhibitors demonstrated that in vitro it was possible to delay significantly selection of mutations producing resistance to one or both inhibitors. These studies indicate that there may be some rationale for combining different protease inhibitors as well as protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitors in HIV combination therapy."

Immunologic response to therapy, as measured by lymphocyte subsets, 3-color flow cytometric measures, and lymphoproliferative assays, were investigated for changes in weeks 44 and 48. The most significant changes after baseline that were associated with the administration of a protease inhibitor-containing regimen were seen for percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+), CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-), and CD8. The percentages of CD8(+)/CD38(+)/HLA-DR(+) and CD8(+)/CD95(+)/CD28(-) decreased from baseline medians of 33% and 46% to medians of 18% and 30% at week 44 (P<.0001 for both). Median CD4 cell count increased 168 cells/microL (from 694 cells/microL to 862 cells/microL; P=.02) by week 48 in this clinically stable population.

2926,0.002,2.0,"Several noninvasive blood biomarkers have been established for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, but their clinical performance remains inconclusive. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers and developed a novel algorithm for assessing liver fibrosis. Six hundred and sixteen chronically HBV-infected and treatment-naïve patients who underwent liver biopsy were enrolled and randomly divided into training (N=410) and internal validation cohorts (N=206). One hundred and fifty-nine patients from another centre were recruited as an external validation cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyse the performance of the gamma-glutamyltransferase-to-platelet ratio (GPR), red cell volume distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR), FIB-4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and HBV DNA level against liver histology, and a novel algorithm was developed using the recursive partitioning and regression tree (RPART) method. In the training cohort, the area under the ROC curve of FIB-4 was significantly higher than that of APRI (P=.038) but was comparable to those of GPR, RPR and HBV DNA; however, the performance of the biomarkers was similar among the validation cohort. The established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm performed better in the training cohort than any individual blood biomarker, and the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 63%, 90%, 72% and 80%, respectively. In the internal and external validation cohorts, the performance of the algorithm in assessing liver fibrosis was also superior to that of other biomarkers. These results suggest that the established RPR-HBV DNA algorithm might improve the diagnostic accuracy of liver fibrosis in treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, although additional studies are warranted to confirm these findings."
2132,0.002,2.0,"Loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is considered to reflect the resolution of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Patient characteristics and various seromarkers were evaluated to characterize factors predicting spontaneous HBsAg loss in a cohort of HBeAg-seronegative patients with presumed chronic HBV infection. Relationships between seromarkers and HBsAg loss were assessed annually and after 6 years using binary logistic regression. Among the 634 participants, 117 (18.45%) cleared HBsAg after 6 years, with a 3.08% annual seroclearance rate. Baseline HBsAg levels and platelet (PLT) counts were predictors of HBsAg seroclearance. The HBsAg level predicted HBsAg seroclearance better than the PLT count (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): HBsAg, 0.965 (95%CI, 0.947-0.980) versus PLT count, 0.617 (95%CI, 0.561-0.669); P < 0.001). A cutoff HBsAg level of 10 IU/ml at baseline predicted spontaneous HBsAg seroclearance at 6 years with a diagnostic accuracy of 93.4%, a sensitivity of 87.2%, a specificity of 94.8%, a positive predictive value of 79.1%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0%. HBsAg seroclearance may occur more commonly than expected. A serum HBsAg level <10 IU/ml and PLT count were accurate predictors of clearance."

717,0.002,2.0,"The emerging presence of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection in the United States has been the focus of much attention among health care providers and the general population. Among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there has been a dramatic increase in hepatitis C disease. During the 1980s and early 1990s, hepatitis C was viewed as a disease for which little could be done, both because of ineffective treatment and the severity and lack of adequate treatments for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) itself. Treatment with interferon had poor effect on hepatitis C in the co-infected population, especially for those with advanced immunosuppression. The regimen was difficult to tolerate even with dose reductions. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and effective treatment and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, a substantial portion of HIV-infected patients are living long enough to have their health compromised by hepatic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma owing to hepatitis C, rather than by AIDS-related illness. New treatments are available for hepatitis C, with preliminary research yielding promising results. The role of these medications in managing HIV/HCV co-infection is currently under study, with implications for many. Health care providers are increasingly faced with the challenges of caring for people infected with the hepatitis C virus, and the growing number of individuals co-infected with hepatitis C and HIV. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of hepatitis C, especially in the presence of HIV infection, and to detail the recognition and management of the care of this emerging population."

As part of a longitudinal study of the effectiveness of integrated treatment for homeless persons with SMI and substance abuse or dependence, serological testing was performed to ascertain the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV. At baseline, 6.2% of participants (11/172) were HIV-positive. Nearly one third of participants (37/114) had evidence of prior exposure to HBV, and 30% (34/114) were antibody positive for HCV. About 44% of participants (50/114) had a reactive test for either HBV or HCV. Having a reactive test was strongly associated with substance use, especially with a history of injection drug use. A significant threat exists to the health and well-being of homeless person with SMI due to high prevalence of blood-borne pathogens. Mental health providers need to play a proactive role in the identification of health-related needs and to assist with access to general health services for persons with SMI."
7952,0.002,2.0,"Quality of life (QOL) among patients with HIV/AIDS has been shown to improve once treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been initiated. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Western Uganda to examine the factors associated with QOL among patients who had received ART for the duration of at least six months. We interviewed 330 patients attending the HIV/AIDS clinic at two government-supported hospitals in Western Uganda. We measured QOL using a culturally adapted version of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS-HIV) tool and calculated the physical health summary (PHS) and mental health summary (MHS) scores. In addition, data were collected on sociodemographic factors, three-day self-reported adherence, social support, sexual behavior, CD4 count and viral load. Informational social support was significantly positively correlated with PHS (p=0.001) and MHS (p=0.002). Affectionate support was also significantly positively correlated to PHS (p=0.05) and MHS (p=0.03) but tangible support was not (PHS p value=0.85 and MHS p value=0.31). In the univariate analysis, older age, rural dwelling, alcohol use, CD4 count less than 200, and ART duration of less than one year were significantly associated with lower PHS scores. Lower PHS scores were also associated with sexual inactivity. In multivariate analysis, higher scores on informational social support and CD4> or =200 were associated with higher PHS score and past or recent alcohol consumption was associated with lower scores on MHS. Optimizing ART to restore CD4 count and provision of informational and affectionate social support but not tangible support, to HIV/AIDS patients may improve their QOL."
8995,0.002,2.0,"A prenatal screening program for antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was examined prospectively in a cross-sectional population. Routine screening was performed on 3,241 women during the first trimester. Serum samples yielding repeatedly positive results on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (n = 6) were subjected to confirmatory Western blot testing. All the specimens were determined to be false positive with atypical banding regions not consistent with HIV-1 infection. This false-positive rate was higher than in previous reports of screening programs in low-risk populations (P less than .005). Since antibody to HIV may not be detectable for several months after infection, we serially tested 984 of the women in different trimesters of pregnancy to determine whether repeat testing would yield seroconversion undetected at the first screening. No patient who initially tested negative on the ELISA tested positive later in gestation. We therefore recommend that routine screening be performed only once during pregnancy, preferably in the first or early second trimester, in the general population."
9518,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the risk of intrauterine growth restriction in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women and to describe the associated risk factors. A cohort study was performed among HIV-infected women who delivered in a single tertiary centre in Barcelona, Spain, from January 2006 to December 2011. Consecutive singleton pregnancies delivered beyond 22 weeks of pregnancy were included. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was defined as a birth weight below the 10th customised centile for gestational age and IUGR babies were compared to non-IUGR newborns. Intrauterine Doppler findings were described among IUGR foetuses. Baseline characteristics, HIV infection data and perinatal outcome were compared between groups. The results were adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 156 singleton pregnancies were included. IUGR occurred in 23.4 % of cases (38/156). In two-thirds of the cases detected before birth, Doppler abnormalities compatible with placental insufficiency were observed. IUGR pregnancies presented a worse perinatal outcome, mainly due to a higher risk of iatrogenic preterm delivery [adjusted odds ratio 6.9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.4-33.5]. IUGR foetuses also had a higher risk of emergent Caesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admission. No cases of intrauterine foetal death occurred. A high rate of IUGR was observed among HIV pregnancies, and it was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, mainly iatrogenic preterm and very preterm birth due to placental insufficiency. Our results support that ultrasound detection and follow-up of IUGR foetuses should be part of routine antenatal care in this high-risk population to improve antenatal management."
5077,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global problem and the world has 350 million carriers of chronic hepatitis B. Over 50 % of these have acquired their infection vertically from their mothers (mother-to-child transmission [MTCT]). Majority (>90 %) of vertically-acquired infection results into chronic infection, due to induction of an immune-tolerant state. Hence, management of chronic HBV during pregnancy and strategies to prevent MTCT would go a long way in global control of HBV infection and the morbidity and mortality associated with it. However, chronic HBV infection in pregnancy presents a unique challenge, because of existence of a complex relationship between the physiological changes of pregnancy and the pathophysiological response of body to HBV. This relationship may lead to a varied presentation of the patient to the doctor depending on the period of her pregnancy and stage of her liver disease. Each of these modes of presentation raises issues that need to be addressed for successful maternal and fetal outcome, including prevention of MTCT of HBV. This review will try to give a practical approach in addressing these issues."

Patients with AIDS (n = 11) or ARC (n = 7) had 9% higher rates of REE when compared with 11 healthy volunteers (P less than .05) with similar food intake and of the same body composition. The results obtained from patients with AIDS or ARC were identical. As no differences were found between patients and controls in plasma concentrations of catecholamines, thyroid hormones, cortisol, or tumor necrosis factor, except for lower concentrations of norepinephrine in the patients (mean +/- SD, 233 +/- 111 v 367 +/- 125 ng/L, patients v controls, P less than .01), this hypermetabolism is not explained by higher levels of these catabolic hormones. The results indicate that even in the absence of acute concomitant infections, increased REE may contribute to the weight loss in patients with AIDS or ARC."
1414,0.002,2.0,"Patients with terminal renal failure quite frequently receive blood transfusions on renal replacement therapy; therefore they are at increased risk of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We investigated sera from 380 patients on haemodialysis or with a renal transplant for anti-HIV, using commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Persistent EIA-positive sera were additionally examined by Western blot and ELAVIA test, a commercially available indirect EIA. We found 20 patients (5.3%) with a persistently positive EIA screening test. None gave a positive result with confirmatory tests. Cross-reacting leucocyte antibodies seemed to be responsible for most of these false-positive anti-HIV tests; 12 of 20 EIA-positive sera were found positive for HLA antibodies. Sera from patients on haemodialysis or with a renal transplant, particularly when multiply transfused, have to be investigated carefully before infection with HIV is confirmed."
8621,0.002,2.0,"We have previously shown that the C-terminal region of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef antigen present on the outer surface of virus-infected cells has an affinity for uninfected T cells and that the Nef protein is responsible for T cell death. To exclude completely the possibility of MHC restriction of this cytotoxic activity, the in vitro cytotoxic potential of HIV-1 Nef against various CD4+ T cell lines as well as naive T lymphocytes was investigated using a baculovirus expression system. Insect cells expressing myristoylated Nef on their cell surface were shown to kill a proportion of CD4+ T cells within 8 h. However, N-terminal truncated and unmyristoylated Nef proteins were not present on the outer surface of insect cell membranes and failed to show any killing activity. Monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal region of Nef inhibited cytolysis. Thus, we conclude that specific Nef-mediated cytolysis is induced by contact with unprimed CD4+ T lymphocytes without MHC restriction."
3184,0.002,2.0,"The nef gene of primate immunodeficiency viruses is essential for high-titer virus replication and AIDS pathogenesis in vivo. In tissue culture, Nef is not required for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but enhances viral infectivity. We and others have shown that Nef is incorporated into HIV-1 particles and cleaved by the viral proteinase. To determine the signal for Nef incorporation and to analyze whether virion-associated Nef is responsible for enhancement of infectivity, we generated a panel of nef mutants and analyzed them for virion incorporation of Nef and for their relative infectivities. We report that N-terminal truncations of Nef abolished its incorporation into HIV particles. Incorporation was reconstituted by targeting the respective proteins to the plasma membrane by using a heterologous signal. Mutational analysis revealed that both myristoylation and an N-terminal cluster of basic amino acids were required for virion incorporation and for plasma membrane targeting of Nef. Grafting the N-terminal anchor domain of Nef onto the green fluorescent protein led to membrane targeting and virion incorporation of the resulting fusion protein. These results indicate that Nef incorporation into HIV-1 particles is mediated by plasma membrane targeting via an N-terminal bipartite signal which is reminiscent of a Src homology region 4. Virion incorporation of Nef correlated with enhanced infectivity of the respective viruses in a single-round replication assay. However, the phenotypes of HIV mutants with reduced Nef incorporation only partly correlated with their ability to replicate in primary lymphocytes, indicating that additional or different mechanisms may be involved in this system."
9521,0.002,2.0,"Although the pathogenetic significance of hepatitis B virus x protein (HBxAg) in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma has already been studied, the comparative analyses of both the actual serum HBxAg levels and antibody production against various HBx epitopes have been examined to lesser extent. We have simultaneously investigated the relationship between antibody production (IgG and IgM) against the HBxAg fragments and HBxAg level in the sera of patients with acute (14) or chronic hepatitis (80) and symptomless carriers (12). A recently developed sandwich-type ELISA was used for the quantitative measurements of HBxAg. Overlapping recombinant and synthetic antigens were used to map the fine epitope specificities of circulating anti-HBx antibodies. In acute hepatitis, we have found high and homogenous correlation in the IgM type immune responses against all the examined HBxAg regions. Moreover, strong correlation has been observed between IgG type immune responses to a characteristic C-terminal region (C1: 79-117) and the longest fragment (X: 10-143). Moderate correlation has been found between HBxAg concentration and the IgG type anti-HBx antibody levels against C-terminus of HBxAg in patients with chronic hepatitis. In the case of symptomless carriers, there were also demonstrable associations in the immune responses against the C-terminal sequences; however, significant correlations were found for antibody production against the N-terminal region as well. The examinations show that the C-terminal sequence, responsible for transactivation, promotes an efficient IgG antibody response in all three groups of patients, whereas the negative regulator N-terminal part of the HBxAg molecule for the most part does not trigger antibody production. This suggests that the immune responses against various - biologically active - epitopes of the HBxAg may have a different role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis and may be used as prognostic markers in human HBV infections."

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to identify both the risk factors associated with colonization/infection by methicillin-resistant S. aureus in HIV patients and the methods used for characterization of isolates. An electronic search of articles published between January 2001 and December 2013 was first conducted. Among 116 studies categorized as being at a quality level of A, B or C, only 9 studies were considered to have high methodological quality (level A). The majority of these studies were retrospective (4/9 studies). The risk factors associated with colonization/infection by S. aureus were use of antimicrobials (4/9 studies), previous hospitalization (4/9 studies) and low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (<200 cells/μl) (3/9 studies). Culture in mannitol salt agar (3/9 studies) and the latex agglutination test (5/9 studies) were the main methods used for bacterial phenotypic identification. Genotypic profiles were accessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (6/9 studies) and USA300 was the most prevalent lineage (5/9 studies). Most isolates were resistant to erythromycin (3/9 studies) and susceptible to vancomycin (4/9 studies). Ultimately, use of antimicrobials and previous hospitalization were the main risk factors for colonization/infection by methicillin-resistant S. aureus in HIV-infected individuals. However, the numbers of evaluated patients, the exclusion and inclusion criteria and the characterization of the S. aureus isolates were not uniform, which made it difficult to establish the characteristics associated with HIV patients who are colonized/infected by S. aureus.

4829,0.002,2.0,"We have analyzed the sequences of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients receiving antiretroviral therapy to evaluate the drug resistance-associated mutations. Of 84 HIV-1-infected individuals treated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 43 (51.2%) have been found to carry amino acid substitutions predicted to acquire drug-resistances. One to 3 mutations at amino acid residues reported to be associated with protease inhibitor-resistance were detected in more than 80% of protease inhibitor-naive patients. However, these pre-existing mutations did not seem to raise a real resistance after the initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors. Phenotypic resistance assay was performed with 6 clinical isolates to compare with genotypic resistance. In most of the cases, phenotype was correlated with genotypic changes, however, two strains which were isolated from patients having no experience of chemotherapy showed a decrease in susceptibility to several drugs without any resistance-related mutations detected in their genes. Taken together, determination of phenotypic resistance is necessary, especially when a newly-infected patients starts antiviral therapy."
9288,0.002,2.0,"Hepatocarcinogenesis is heavily influenced by chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection. Elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1/PAI-1) have been reported in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with viral infection. The gene encoding SERPINE1 is highly polymorphic and the frequently associated 4/5 guanosine (4G/5G) polymorphism in the gene promoter may influence its expression. Here, we investigated the distribution of genotypes and the frequency of alleles of the 4G/5G polymorphism in patients with HCC, the influence of the 4G/5G polymorphism on plasma SERPINE1 levels and its association with viral infection. A total of 75 patients with HCC were enrolled: 32 (42.6%) were HBV(+)/HCV(+), 11 (14.6%) were only HCV(+), and 32 (42.6%) were negative for both viruses. A control group of healthy donors was also enrolled (n=50). SERPINE1 plasma concentrations were determined by ELISA and the detection of the promoter 4G/5G polymorphism was performed by an allele-specific PCR analysis. We found that the frequency of both the 4G/4G genotype (p=0.02) and the 4G allele (p=0.006) were significantly higher in patients with HCC compared to the control group, and particularly higher in patients with HCC co-infected with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than in those with no viral infection. We also found that patients with the 4G/4G genotype had significantly higher plasma SERPINE1 protein levels when compared with patients with the 4G/5G or 5G/5G genotype (p<0.001). Differences in frequency of 4G allele and genetic variability of 4G/5G SERPINE1 polymorphism with a higher level of SERPINE1 protein in patients with HCC with HBV(+)/HCV(+) than those without infection, suggest the presence of two distinct pathogenic mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis, depending on the etiology."
9532,0.002,2.0,"In vitro, recombinant soluble CD4 (rsCD4) attaches to and inactivates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine if prolonged therapy with high-dose intravenous rsCD4 provides an in vivo benefit, we gave three HIV-1-infected patients with AIDS, whose isolates were susceptible in vitro to rsCD4, 10 mg/kg of rsCD4 for 4 weeks, 5 mg/kg for 4 weeks, and 1 mg/kg for 2 weeks. Single-dose pharmacokinetic studies performed prior to this showed transient in vivo decreases of HIV-1 plasma viremia in all three subjects. Surrogate markers of HIV activity, clinical status, HIV-1 p24 antigen, plasma HIV-1 titers, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) intracellular titers of virus were measured at entry, and every other week after onset of therapy. All subjects demonstrated rsCD4 concentration-dependent reduction in plasma viremia, with two subjects having complete neutralization of cell-free virus. The third subject's isolate was relatively resistant to the in vivo effects of rsCD4 and only partial reduction in plasma virus titers was obtained, even at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg. There was no change in the PBMC intracellular viral titer or surrogate markers of HIV-1 activity (including CD4 cell count and beta 2-microglobulin). There was subjective improvement in clinical symptoms, and all subjects gained weight with the highest doses of rsCD4. rsCD4 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range studied. We conclude that high-dose intravenous rsCD4 can be safely given for up to 10 weeks and that it has a stable pharmacokinetic profile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
1893,0.002,2.0,"We have examined the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on mortality of patients treated for tuberculosis in a prospective study in Lusaka, Zambia. Patients with sputum smear-positive, miliary, or meningeal tuberculosis were prescribed 2 months' daily streptomycin, thiacetazone, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide followed by 6 months thiacetazone and isoniazid; others, 2 months streptomycin, thiacetazone and isoniazid followed by 10 months thiacetazone and isoniazid. 239 patients (65 HIV-negative and 174 HIV-positive) were followed to 2 years from start of treatment. The crude mortality rate ratio for HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative patients over 2 years was 5.00 (95% confidence interval 2.30-10.86). Median survival for HIV-positive patients from the start of treatment was 22 months. At least 34% of HIV-positive patients for whom cause of death was known died from tuberculosis, three-quarters of these during the first month of treatment. Risk factors for death in HIV-positive patients included multi-site tuberculosis, history of prolonged diarrhoea or fever, oral thrush, splenomegaly, anergy to tuberculin, low weight, anaemia or lymphopenia, and poor compliance with regimens containing rifampicin and pyrazinamide. Tuberculosis, even treated, was a major cause of death in patients with HIV infection."

3843,0.002,2.0,"Pulmonary hypertension is an important cause of dyspnoea in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) patients. The effect highly active antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary artery pressure has been an area of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of antiretroviral therapy on pulmonary hypertension in HIV patients. This prospective cohort study was performed in a peripheral medical college of West Bengal with 88 patients from October 2008 to September 2011. By echocardiography, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded before initiation of antiretroviral therapy. After one year of antiretroviral therapy repeat echocardiography was done and pulmonary artery pressure was evaluated. The values were analysed. The present study showed that highly active antiretroviral therapy improves pulmonary artery pressure in HIV/AIDS patients if instituted at early stages (WHO classes I and II). However, at more advanced stages of pulmonary artery hypertension, it does not have any significant effect on reduction of the same. The present study documents that early detection of pulmonary artery hypertension in HIV/AIDS patients is essential and prompt institution of highly active antiretroviral therapy should be considered in them even when those patients do not fulfill the conventional criteria for initiation of this treatment."

2398,0.002,2.0,"In the current study we investigated the prevalence of the TNF-α 238G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TNF-α gene in the development of lipodystrophy among HIV-1 infected individuals who had been receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the immunodeficiency clinics of the National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) at Pune, India. We assessed the association of this SNP with the development of lipoatrophy/dyslipidemia and insulin resistance in these patients and measured carotid intima thickening which is a surrogate marker for chronic cardiac morbidity. Our results show that the incidence of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP is ~ two fold higher in patients with lipodystrophy as compared to those without lipodystrophy. Patients with lipodystrophy demonstrated a higher likelihood of the development of metabolic syndrome as evident by increased insulin sensitivity and increased percentage (%) β cell function. Further, a significant increase in left carotid intima thickness was observed in patients with lipodystrophy. Our study validates the association of the TNF-α 238G/A SNP allelic variant with the development of HIV- lipodystrophy via the modulation of TNF-α production, which contributes to dyslipidemia, increased lipolysis, increased insulin resistance, altered differentiation of adipocytes and increased carotid intima thickness. The contribution of genetic determinants such as the TNF-α 238G/A SNP to lipodystrophy, may provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie this disease condition and may be useful in the future for personalized therapy. Additionally, these findings will be useful in monitoring chronic cardiac morbidities among HIV infected individuals who express this SNP. "

HBV- and HCV-related chronic hepatitis is the main causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of liver that are responsible for a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The study was done to analyze the prevalence of HBV and HCV among the people of Mymensingh City, Bangladesh. This cross sectional data was collected from the blood transfusion department of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital and descriptive analysis was performed. Out of 2015 participants, 126 were HBsAg positive and 45% were found HCV positive cases. Based on the results, it concludes that similar prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were seen in Bangladesh as other Asian countries."

To solve this problem, we used inducible system of gene expression regulation (Tat-TAR-system), which is utilized by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). tat and tk-HSV genes, as well as a fragment of LTR HIV-1, were cloned in the retrovirus vector, tk-HSV gene was under control of the LTR HIV-1 fragment. Potential capacity of these constructions for transactivating tk-HSV gene transcription was studied. Basal expression level of this gene was defined in transient transfection of HEK293 cells. It was shown that specific transactivation of the tk-HSV gene was controlled by the LTR HIV-1 fragment in lung carcinoma cells Calu-1, permanently transfected by the tat gene construction.

5478,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes can be established by methods based on PCR typing and serological typing. The accuracy of these methods depends on their sensitivity and specificity. These should be compared with the reference method, direct sequencing, and analysis of viral genomes. Among the serologic methods recently developed, the performance of a new serotyping assay (RIBA HCV 3.0 SIA, Chiron corporation, Emeryville) was assessed using a panel of 147 well-characterized French isolates from chronic hepatitis C patients. Definitive genotypes of the isolates were established by direct sequencing in 5' NC and in some cases in NS-5B. HCV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were determined by measuring type specific antibodies to core and NS-4 derived peptide antigens. Of the 147 sera, serotypic-specific antibodies were detected in 136 (sensitivity, 92.5%). The specificity of the RIBA SIA HCV serotyping assay was 92.6% (including samples with mixed results); without these, the specificity was 80.1%. Analysis of the 28 discrepant samples showed that (1) a different serotype was found in 18 samples including five for genotype 1, three for genotype 2, two for genotype 3, five for genotype 4, and three for genotype 5, and that (2) ten patients showed a reactivity with mixed serotypes, one had circulating antibodies to type 1 or 2, and nine had circulating antibodies to type 1 or 3. In summary, except for genotypes 4 and 5, the results of the test were well correlated (85.7%) with those of direct sequence genotyping. The former test is rapid and does not require the strict HCV RNA storage and preservation conditions of the latter. This new method may thus be considered as an alternative for HCV typing. However, although it is convenient, its lower sensitivity compared to the molecular typing method and the discrepant results limit its routine use in a clinical context."

All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and a random sample of them was asked to provide a blood sample for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV) testing. Individual questions or combinations of them were evaluated in terms of their ability to detect HBV or HCV(+) cases. Of 9085 eligible employees, 6074 (67%) completed the questionnaire. Of 990 samples obtained, 19.9% were anti-HBc(+), 2.6% HBsAg(+) and 0.5% anti-HCV(+). All anti-HCV(+) cases had multiple parenteral risk factors. Multiple logistic regression identified associations between anti-HBc and older age, family members with chronic hepatitis, job category and history of transfusion before 1992. HBsAg(+) was associated with older age and history of transfusion before 1992. None of the risk/prognostic factors had sufficient sensitivity and specificity for HBV but report of at least one risk factor identified all HCV(+) cases. Anti-HCV screening of those with at least two parenteral risk factors not only identified all anti-HCV(+) cases but also resulted in 86% decrease in the screening cost. Under the light of recent treatment advances, targeted questionnaire-based screening of asymptomatic people may prove to be a cost-effective way to face hepatitis C."

The Blood-borne Virus Transmission Risk Assessment Questionnaire (BBV-TRAQ). was developed in Australia to determine risk behaviors for specific infections. Blood testing for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C was performed on all participants, and data on blood tests were linked to questionnaires. The BBV-TRAQ was administered to 242 current and former injection drug users in Long Beach, California, and the Long Beach data were compared with the original Australian data. In the comparison of the mean scores on the three subscales and total scores on the BBV-TRAQ between the samples, means for all three subscales and the total BBV-TRAQ score were significantly different, with Long Beach scores consistently lower than the Australian sample. The injecting and sexual risk subscales were significantly different across levels of AIDS risk perception for all three types of injectors; however, the other skin penetration practices subscale had no significant association with AIDS risk perception for any of the injection drug user groups. Despite recent efforts to educate injectors about the risks associated with practices captured by the other skin penetration practices subscale, such as tattooing and sharing razors, this subscale does not have an association with AIDS risk perception. injection drug users in Australia may have better access to health care, giving their self-report of infection greater validity than the California sample."

Thirty-four subjects were assigned to placebo and 36 subjects to zidovudine, 200 mg orally every 4 h (1,200 mg daily). Functional status and well-being were measured every 3 months using a 30-item self-administered questionnaire derived from health ratings from the Medical Outcomes Study. The mean changes from baseline for zidovudine versus placebo groups were compared using paired and two-sample t tests. Subjects receiving a placebo reported better quality of life compared to baseline than subjects receiving zidovudine at 24 weeks for all dimensions of well-being, including overall health, energy, mental health, health distress, pain, and quality of life. The difference between the two groups' changes from baseline for overall health was 11.5 points on a 100-point scale (p = 0.02), and 11.1 points for energy (0.002). There were no differences between changes from baseline along various dimensions of functional status (physical, social, role, and cognitive function). At 52 weeks both groups reported worse overall health than at baseline, and changes in scores were more similar for the two groups.

This was a retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected patients receiving cART in Taizhou, Zhejiang, China, 2009-2015. Liver fibrosis was assessed by Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) score. Improvement of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% decrease in FIB-4 from baseline, whereas progression of liver fibrosis was defined as having > 30% increase in FIB-4 score from baseline. A total of 955 HIV-infected patients were included. Of these, 808 (84.6%) were HIV-monoinfection, 125 (13.1%) were HIV/hepatitis B virus (HBV) coinfection and 29 (3.0%) were HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection. The median duration of treatment was 15 months. After treatment, 37.1% participants had > 30% decreases in FIB-4 index, 14.8% had > 30% increases in FIB-4 index, while the remaining 48.2% had stabilized FIB-4 index. In multivariate analysis, improvement of liver fibrosis was negatively associated with an older age, but was positively associated with baseline FIB-4 index and > 30% increases in CD4 cell count after ART. Progression of liver fibrosis was positively associated with an older age, but was negatively associated with gender and HIV transmission mode (male homosexual vs. male heterosexual, female heterosexual vs. male heterosexual), and baseline FIB-4 index. Our findings indicate that improvement of liver fibrosis could be achieved by early initiation of ART through better CD4 cell recovery. Liver fibrosis and hepatotoxicity associated with ART should be monitored as early as possible and throughout till the end of treatment, with special attention to the elderly and heterosexual men."

Evidence of infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) was obtained by detecting IgM specific for HAV in a single serum sample or by demonstrating a rising titer of antibody in paired sera by solid-phase radioimmunoassay. HAV was detected in the feces of 59 of the 200 patients by solid-phase radioimmunoassay and immune electron microscopy. When patients were admitted within one week of the onset of dark urine, 45% were found to be shedding HAV, whereas only 11% of specimens obtained from patients admitted during the second week contained virus. HAV was not detected in fecal specimens collected more than 14 days after the onset of dark urine.

Neurologic, laboratory, imaging, and pathologic examinations identified 40 Mexican patients and 130 U.S. patients with neurologic complications. Whereas AIDS dementia complex was the most common neurologic manifestation in both groups, intracranial tuberculoma was present only in the Mexican population (10%). Primary brain lymphoma was more prevalent in the U.S. population (8.4%). The different findings in the Mexican population likely reflect afflictions common to developing countries--a high prevalence of tuberculosis and a high mortality rate.

77,0.002,2.0,"We investigated the long-term health effects of HIV-1 infection in homosexual men not close to developing AIDS by comparing 916 HIV-1-seropositive (SP) men at least 1.67-3.67 years prior to a clinical AIDS diagnosis to 2,161 HIV-1-seronegative (SN) controls. The SP group reported a higher total of 12 distinct symptoms (fatigue, shortness of breath, night sweats, rash, cough, diarrhea, headache, thrush, skin discoloration, fever, weight loss, and sore throat/mouth) than did the SN group (p < 0.0001), corresponding to at least 5.6 more days/year of such symptoms. The SP group had lower body mass index (p < 0.0001) and lower hemoglobin (p < 0.0001). The SP group was more depressed, as measured by CES-D score (p = 0.047), before knowledge of one's serostatus was likely, and became even further depressed (p = 0.038 for increase in depression) after the HIV-1 serostatus test was accessible to high-risk groups. These associations remained unchanged in multivariate models, incorporating other covariates."
7768,0.002,2.0,"The safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea with didanosine in combination with stavudine in nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-experienced patients was investigated. Entry criteria included HIV-1 infected, NRTI-experienced adults, with CD4(+) counts 50-550 cells/mm(3) and viral loads >or=12,500 copies/mL. Subjects were treated with didanosine 200 mg twice a day (BID), stavudine 40 mg BID, and hydroxyurea 1000 mg daily for 16 weeks. Thirty-one HIV-1 subjects with mean bDNA viral load 1x10(5) log(10) copies/mL and mean CD4(+) T-cell counts of 231 cells/mm(3) were enrolled. A 1.3 log(10) decrease in mean viral load was seen at 12 weeks of therapy. Prior didanosine use resulted in a more rapid response to therapy compared with prior zidovudine use. Side effects consisting of neutropenia, pancreatitis, and peripheral neuropathy occurred in four subjects and resolved upon withdrawal of therapy. This non-randomized study in subjects with a mean CD4(+) T-cell count of 230 cells/mm(3) demonstrates the antiviral activity of hydroxyurea+didanosine and stavudine. Toxicities related to therapy need to be followed closely. The results support the need for a randomized, prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea plus didanosine in antiretroviral-experienced patients with CD4(+) cell counts below 300 cells/mm(3)."
4023,0.002,2.0,"The number of HIV-infected individuals with prior multiple treatment failures is increasing as time passes by. The success of antiretroviral therapy in these patients is often compromised by the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Despite initial concerns, a rebound in AIDS cases among heavily treatment-experienced patients failing virologically their antiretroviral therapy has not occurred yet. In a multicenter study conducted in Spain, HIV-infected patients were assessed with prior failure to antiretrovirals from the three main drug families who presented during the last semester of the year 2003 with plasma HIV-RNA values above 1,000 copies/ml, despite good treatment adherence. The relationships between CD4+ T cell counts, viral loads and drug-resistant genotypes were examined. A total of 273 patients were identified in 12 centers (78% male, median age: 41 years). The mean viral load was 50,438 copies/ml and the mean CD4+ count was 328 cells/mul. Only 19.5% had less than 200 CD4+ T cells/mul. Most patients (95%) were receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) in their last antiretroviral regimen, while 63% were treated with protease inhibitors (PI) and 27% on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI). Overall, 97.4% had at least one drug resistance mutation (87.2% for NRTI, 68.5% for NNRTI, and 92.7% for PI). Using the virtual phenotype, resistance to three or more drugs within each class was recognized in 45.8% for NRTI, 40.7% for NNRTI, and 44.7% for PI. Moreover, cross-resistance to compounds from two or three drug families was recognized in 41% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Nearly half of the patients had plasma HIV-RNA below 10,000 copies/ml and they showed significantly higher CD4 + counts than those with greater viremia (408 versus 259 cells/mul; P < 0.001). Patients with higher plasma viremia had significantly more drug resistance mutations than those with lower viremia. No favorable effect on viral load could be recognized for individual drug resistance mutations known to reduce viral fitness in vitro (i.e., rtM184V, rtL74V, rtK65R, proD30N, or proI50L). In summary, a large proportion of treatment-experienced patients failing their current antiretroviral regimen carry viruses with broad cross-resistant genotypes. Nearly half of the patients with these multi-drug resistant viruses had < 10,000 HIV-RNA copies/ml and 80% have more than 200 CD4 + T cells/mul. Thus, maintaining treatment HIV-infected individuals failing virologically and harboring drug-resistant viruses might ameliorate immunological deterioration until new drugs became available. J. Med.

7365,0.002,2.0,"We evaluated, for the first time in Latin America, the performance of a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Berkeley, Calif.) that detects human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific antibodies in urine in comparison to standard serological assays (two commercial EIAs and a commercial Western blot [WB] assay). Paired serum and urine specimens were collected from two different groups of Brazilian patients: 225 drug users with unknown HIV status who attended drug treatment centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 135 subjects with known HIV status. Patients showing positive results in the serum EIAs and/or in the urine EIA were serologically confirmed by WB assay. For 135 individuals with known HIV status, the urine EIA showed 100% sensitivity (74 positive samples) and 95.1% specificity (58 of 61 negative specimens). For 225 drug users, the test showed 100% sensitivity (2 positive samples) and 98.7% specificity (220 of 223 negative samples) compared to WB-confirmed serological EIA results. Thus, in a total of 360 samples, the urine EIA correctly identified all 76 HIV-positive samples and 278 of 284 negative samples (100% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity). Detailed analysis of the urine EIA results indicates that an increase of the recommended cutoff value might raise the specificity of the assay without affecting its sensitivity. Our results suggest that the HIV-1 urine EIA is a good screening test suitable for developing countries like Brazil. However, as for all other HIV screening tests on the market, it is not specific enough to be used as a one-step test and therefore requires confirmation."
9485,0.002,2.0,"CD4 + lymphocyte counts are routinely ordered during the early phases of antiretroviral therapy and for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections in HIV-positive patients. Flow cytometry is the standard methodology for CD4 counts in Brazilian reference laboratories. However, these laboratories are located in large cities, frequently distant from patients, thus limiting patient access and delaying results. We compared a point-of-care test with flow cytometry determination of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts in HIV patients. We analysed 107 consecutive samples by both methods. Overall, the point-of-care test performed well, with excellent agreement between it and the standard method. Test results were concordant for patients with CD4(+) T lymphocyte values above and below 200 cells/mm (3). The performance characteristics obtained were sensitivity 94% (95% CI 89.5-98.5%), specificity 93% (95% CI 88.2-97.8%), positive predictive value 86% (95% CI 79.4-92.6%), and negative predictive value 97% (95% CI 94-100%). The high sensitivity and specificity of the point-of-care test methodology suggest its utility as an alternative method for rapid measurement of CD4(+) T lymphocytes in patients with limited access to reference laboratories, enabling prompt therapeutic intervention for patients at risk of progression to AIDS.

9174,0.002,2.0,"Interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced cells express the proteasome subunits low molecular weight protein (LMP)2, LMP7, and MECL-1 (multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like 1), leading to the formation of immunoproteasomes. Although these subunits are thought to optimize MHC class I antigen processing, the extent of their role and the mechanistic aspects involved remain unclear. Herein, we study the proteolytic generation of an human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-Aw68-restricted hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope that is recognized by peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with acute self-limited but not chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Immunological data suggest that IFN-gamma-induced rather than uninduced HeLa cells process and present the HBV CTL epitope upon infection with HBcAg-expressing vaccinia viruses. Analyses of 20S proteasome digests of synthetic polypeptides covering the antigenic HBcAg peptide demonstrate that only immunoproteasomes efficiently perform the cleavages needed for the liberation of this HBV CTL epitope. Although the concerted presence of the three immunosubunits appears essential, we find that both catalytically active LMP7 and inactive LMP7 T1A support CTL epitope generation. We conclude that LMP7 influences the structural features of 20S proteasomes, thereby enhancing the activity of the LMP2 and MECL-1 catalytic sites, which provide cleavage specificity. Thus, LMP7 incorporation is of greater functional importance for the generation of an HBV CTL epitope than cleavage specificity."

7935,0.002,2.0,"We have examined the in vivo effect of hepatitis B virus (HBV) core promoter mutations on the expression of precore mRNA and pregenomic RNA transcripts in the liver of 24 patients with chronic HBV infection, applying a novel transcript-specific RT-PCR assay. The double A1762T/G1764A mutation in the basic core promoter was detected in 11 cases. This mutation was in all cases associated with absence or low levels of precore mRNA transcripts without significantly affecting the levels of total core promoter-directed transcription in the liver of infected patients. Precore mRNA synthesis was suppressed by the A1762T/G1764A mutation regardless of the presence of the precore stop codon mutation G1896A, suggesting that in addition to downregulating an immunomodulatory protein this double basic core promoter mutation may also confer a replication advantage to the virus. Additional mutations detected in the core promoter may also contribute to the observed changes in precore mRNA levels. Our in vivo study shows therefore that the double A1762T/G1764A mutation is associated with the specific suppression of precore mRNA synthesis directed by the HBV core promoter."
4585,0.002,2.0,"A simulation model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, which incorporated French data on the progression of HIV disease in the absence of antiretroviral therapy and on cost, was used to determine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of different strategies for the prevention of opportunistic infections in French patients who receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Compared with use of no prophylaxis, use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) increased per-person lifetime costs from euro 185,600 to euro 187,900 and quality-adjusted life expectancy from 112.2 to 113.7 months, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 18,700 per quality-adjusted life-year (euro/QALY) gained. Compared with use of TMP-SMZ alone, use of TMP-SMZ plus azithromycin cost euro 23,900/QALY gained; adding fluconazole cost an additional euro 54,500/QALY gained. All strategies that included oral ganciclovir had cost-effectiveness ratios that exceeded euro 100,000/QALY gained. In the era of HAART, on the basis of French data, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmic encephalitis, and Mycobacterium avium complex bacteremia is cost-effective. Prophylaxis against fungal and cytomegalovirus infections is less cost-effective than are other therapeutic options for HIV disease and should remain of lower priority."
2459,0.002,2.0,"To evaluate the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposure among emergency department workers (EDWs) and their ability to identify HIV-infected patients, a seroprevalence study was performed in March 1991 in the emergency departments (EDs) of six Italian urban hospitals. At each visit, patients aged 18-65 years were asked to undergo fingerstick blood sampling for anonymous, unlinked HIV testing performed on blood adsorbed filter paper collection cards. Demographic characteristics, known or suspected HIV risk factors, and occupational exposures reported by the EDWs during the patient's visit were recorded. On 9,457 consecutive visits, 9,005 samples (95%) were tested and 65 (0.7%) were HIV positive. ED staff failed to identify 59% of HIV-infected patients. The rate of occupational exposures was 0.13/100 visits. As it is impossible to predict the HIV status of patients attending EDs, adherence to universal precautions and the development of safer devices should be utilized to minimize the risk of blood-borne infections in EDWs."
835,0.002,2.0,"Many hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are also infected with HIV, and undergo antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Due to changes in HIV burden and immunologic status, HIV ARV treatment may have indirect effects on the HCV population, which could impact the effectiveness of subsequent HCV protease inhibitor (PI) treatment. The genetic variability of the protease-encoding HCV NS3 gene was evaluated in 10 co-infected patients initiating ARVs (both before and after ARV initiation), and compared to the genetic variability in 10 patients on stable ARV therapy. After RT-PCR of plasma-derived HCV RNA, a mean of 20 clones per patient time-point were sequenced and analyzed for changes in the HCV quasispecies population. No significant differences in sequence diversity or complexity at the nucleic acid or amino acid levels were seen at baseline between groups or between the two time points in either group. HCV protease diversity in the pre- and post-ARV treatment samples was not significantly different than samples from patients on stable ARV therapy. There was no significant development of amino acid substitutions known to confer HCV PI resistance in either group. Initiation of ARV for HIV infection does not significantly alter the genetic diversity or complexity of the HCV NS3 gene or result in increased number of HCV PI-associated amino acid changes. These results suggest ARV treatment for HIV would not affect the efficacy of HCV PI treatment."
7698,0.002,2.0,"Counselling about antiretroviral therapy (ART) is thought important to prepare patients for treatment and enhance adherence. A workplace-based HIV care programme in South Africa instituted a three-step ART counselling protocol with guidelines prompting issues to be covered at each step. We carried out an early evaluation of ART counselling to determine whether patients understood key information about ART, and the perceptions that patients and health care professionals (HCP) had of the process. Among 40 patients (median time on ART 83 days), over 90% answered 6/7 HIV/ART knowledge-related questions correctly. 95% thought counselling sessions were good. 93% thought ongoing counselling was important. Recommendations included the need for continuing education about HIV/ART, being respectful, promoting HIV testing and addressing the issues of infected partners and stigma. 24 participating HCP identified additional training needs including counselling of family and friends, family planning, sexually transmitted infections and running support groups. 90% of HCP thought that counselling guidelines were helpful. The programme appears to be preparing patients well for ART. Counselling should be offered at every clinic visit. Counselling guidelines were a valuable tool and may be useful elsewhere. The evaluation helped to assess the quality of the programme and to suggest areas for improvement."
5968,0.002,2.0,"Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus macaques causes immune depletion and disease closely resembling human AIDS and is well recognized as the most relevant animal model for the human disease. Experimental investigations of viral pathogenesis and vaccine protection primarily involve a limited set of related viruses originating in sooty mangabeys (SIVsmm). The diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved in humans in about a century; in contrast, SIV isolates used in the macaque model evolved in sooty mangabeys over millennia. To investigate the possible consequences of such different evolutionary histories for selection pressures and observed diversity in SIVsmm and HIV-1, we isolated, sequenced, and analyzed 20 independent isolates of SIVsmm, including representatives of 7 distinct clades of viruses isolated from natural infection. We found SIVsmm diversity to be lower overall than HIV-1 M group diversity. Reduced positive selection (i.e., less diversifying evolution) was evident in extended regions of SIVsmm proteins, most notably in Gag p27 and Env gp120. In addition, the relative diversities of proteins in the two lineages were distinct: SIVsmm Env and Gag were much less diverse than their HIV-1 counterparts. This may be explained by lower SIV-directed immune activity in mangabeys relative to HIV-1-directed immunity in humans. These findings add an additional layer of complexity to the interpretation and, potentially, to the predictive utility of the SIV/macaque model, and they highlight the unique features of human and simian lentiviral evolution that inform studies of pathogenesis and strategies for AIDS vaccine design."
8817,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) readily sets up a persistent infection and is a major cause of liver disease worldwide. Interferon alfa and ribavirin therapy lead to sustained clearance of virus in 31% to 64% of patients with type 1 and non-type 1 genotypes, respectively. It is not clear to what extent these drugs act directly to reduce HCV replication, or indirectly via host immune responses, and what evoked immune responses are associated with clinical outcome. We have examined prospectively 15 patients with chronic HCV infection before, during, and after combination therapy. Quantitative assays for HCV antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, and flow cytometric assays for analysis of the phenotype of T cells, in addition to viral sequencing of core protein, were performed throughout the treatment and follow-up period over 18 months. We found enhancement of proliferative T-cell responses during therapy. Proliferative responses are strikingly heterogeneous in terms of specificity, kinetics, and magnitude. Proliferative responses are often not associated with interferon-gamma release. T-cell responses are rarely sustained irrespective of treatment outcome and this is not due to the evolution of new immune escape variants. T-cell responses tend to peak late in the course of treatment. In conclusion, combination therapy for HCV has a transient effect on host virus-specific T cells in the blood. Induction of sustained T-cell responses may require additional immune modulation later in therapy."
6225,0.002,2.0,"Genome-wide RNA interference screens have greatly facilitated the identification of essential host factors (EHFs) for viral infections, whose knockdown effects significantly influence virus replication but not host cell viability. However, little has been done to link EHFs with another important host factor type, i.e., virus targeting proteins (VTPs) that viruses directly interact with for intracellular survival, hampering the integrative understanding of virus-host interactions. Using EHFs and VTPs for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and influenza A virus (IAV) infections, we found in general that despite limited overlap, EHFs and VTPs are both among the most differentially dysregulated genes in host transcriptional response to HIV and IAV infections, and notably they show consistency in regulation orientation. In the human protein-protein interaction network, both EHFs and VTPs hold topologically important positions at the global center, and importantly their direct interactions are statistically significant. We also identified BRCA1 and TP53 (or SMAD3 and PIK3R1) being the most extensive VTP-interacting EHFs (or EHF-interacting VTPs) for HIV-1 and IAV, which hold great potential in deciphering specific infection features and discovery of host directed antivirals. Further, most EHFs are the upstream regulators of VTPs when mapped in the same signaling pathways, some of which present intensive cross links. Collectively, these results provide insights into functional associations of the identified host gene factors for viral infections and highlight the regulatory significance of EHFs, and the necessity of their selective exploitation in confrontation to viral infections."
1685,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be subtyped on the basis of nucleotide sequence variability. Knowledge of circulating HIV-1 genotypes or subtypes allows understanding of the origin and spread of HIV-1 in different geographical regions, and is required for rational vaccine development. A study was undertaken to determine the predominant HIV-1 subtype in Australia. Part of the HIV-1 envelope gene (including the variable domain, V3) was sequenced directly from DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 HIV-1 seropositive people in Sydney, Australia. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence suggested that all patients (including individual cases acquired in New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Thailand) were infected with HIV-1 subtype B. Octapeptides from the HIV-1 envelope V3 loop tip indicated variation but included a predominance of the most common subtype B octapeptides HIGPGRAF (4 cases), NIGPGRAF (3 cases) and PIGPGRAF (1 case). These data suggest that subtype B is the major HIV-1 strain in Australia (and probably in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea), although the importation of HIV-1 acquired overseas is likely to lead to the detection and dissemination of other subtypes in Australia."

One sample each year from the date of HCV infection to 1994 was analysed for genotype, virus load and nucleotide sequence of the two genetic loci. Both patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 throughout the study period. The virus load profiles were similar except that the profile for the HIV infected patient was displaced 4 years earlier relative to the other patient. Mean divergence of the quasispecies at both the 5'UTR and NS4 loci was higher in the HIV coinfected patient. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that evolution of the 5'UTR was host independent, whereas the NS4 region containing a CD8 restricted CTL epitope evolved in a host specific fashion."
8524,0.002,2.0,"Comorbidities in human immunodeficiency virus infection are of great interest due to their association with unfavorable outcomes and failure of antiretroviral therapy. This study evaluated the prevalence of coinfection by human immunodeficiency virus and viral hepatitis in an endemic area for hepatitis B in the Western Amazon basin. Serological markers for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis D virus were tested in a consecutive sample of all patients referred for treatment of human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The variables sex, age, origin and exposure category were obtained from medical records and from the sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome surveillance database. Among 704 subjects, the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B carriage was 6.4% and past infection 40.2%. The presence of hepatitis B was associated with birth in hyperendemic areas of the Amazon basin, male sex and illegal drug use. The overall prevalence of hepatitis C was 5% and was associated with illegal drug use. The prevalence of hepatitis B and C among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients in the Western Amazon basin was lower than seen elsewhere and is probably associated with the local epidemiology of these viruses and the degree of overlap of their shared risk factors. An opportunity presents itself to evaluate the prevention of hepatitis C through harm reduction policies and hepatitis B through vaccination programs among human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients."

Intravenous drug use was the most frequent maternal risk factor, although the percentage of women infected by sexual contact increased from 5.8% in 1985 to 28.5% in 1990. Of the 551 first children followed up from birth and older than 15 months of age, 101 (18.3%) acquired infection and seroconverted to HIV-1. Another 31 (5.6%) asymptomatic seronegative children showed the presence of viral markers, for an apparent mother-to-offspring transmission rate of 23.9%. Overlapping results were seen in 22 second-born children followed up from birth. Of 59 sibships with definite infection status, when the first child was infected, 14 (40%) of 35 second children were infected, whereas when the first child was not infected, only 2 of 24 (8.3%) second children were infected. Discordance in HIV-1 transmission was found in 1 of 18 pairs of twins. Univariate and multivariate analyses of possible risk factors for HIV-1 transmission performed on the entire population of children and in the cohort of those followed up from birth were basically in agreement in indicating that the development of symptoms in the mother before delivery and breast-feeding (indeed adopted in only 22 infants in whom HIV-1 infection was identified at birth) were significantly and independently associated with a higher transmission rate.

Serious neurologic manifestations were present in 5 of 16 children (31%) who developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex, although in 2 the neurologic signs were probably not related to HIV. This can be compared with a prevalence of 0 of 23 in children who remained asymptomatic or who had less severe HIV-related symptoms or signs and 2 of 164 (1%) in uninfected children. Neurologic signs in the uninfected group were associated with the presence of drug withdrawal at birth and prematurity. These findings contrast with reports of a high prevalence of neurologic findings in most studies of HIV-infected children."

Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART."

To evaluate factors associated with an undetectable VL near delivery in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and non-HAART regimens, HIV-infected pregnant women with a detectable VL at entry and having used antiretrovirals for ≥4 weeks before delivery were selected. Multivariate analysis was employed using binary logistic unconditional models; the dependent variable was having a VL <400 copies/mL near delivery. VL suppression was achieved in 403/707 women (57%): 65.4% in the HAART group, but only 26% in the non-HAART group P = 0.001. Duration of HAART was correlated with VL suppression, with maximum benefit seen after ≥12 weeks of therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-3.65). CD4+ cell count near delivery (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.06-2.20) and baseline VL (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.94) were also independently associated with VL suppression. Overall MTCT rate was 1.6%.

1475,0.002,2.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has considerably improved the prognosis of HIV-infected patients. However, prolonged use of HAART has been related to long-term adverse events that can compromise patient health such as HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome (HALS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is consistent evidence for a central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in these pathologies. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) have been described to be mainly responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue and liver although nonnucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) have also showed mitochondrial toxicity, which is a major concern for the selection and the long-term adherence to a particular therapy. Several mechanisms explain these deleterious effects of HAART on mitochondria, and evidence points to other mechanisms beyond the ""Pol- γ hypothesis."" HIV infection has also direct effects on mitochondria. In addition to the negative effects described for HIV itself and/or HAART on mitochondria, HIV-infected patients are more prone to develop a premature aging and, therefore, to present an increased oxidative state that could lead to the development of these metabolic disturbances observed in HIV-infected patients.

Further laboratory and clinical evaluation at our facility revealed depressed CD4 lymphocytes, oral candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis with indeterminate results on serologic testing for HIV type 1 (HIV-1). The biopsy specimen of a lesion in the right occipital lobe of the brain documented Toxoplasma gondii, indicating a clinical diagnosis of AIDS. To our knowledge, our study presents the first known patient with HIV-2-associated AIDS in the United States. Our patient provides further evidence that HIV-2 causes severe immunodeficiency and opportunistic infection. The condition should be suspected in the face of normal or repeatedly equivocal HIV-1 antibody test results in the presence of clinically documented AIDS."
1992,0.002,2.0,"We developed a mathematical model using a multiple source of infection framework to assess the potential effect of the expansion of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) coverage among those in medical need on the number of individuals testing newly positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on related costs in British Columbia, Canada, over the next 25 years. The model was calibrated using retrospective data describing antiretroviral therapy utilization and individuals testing newly positive for HIV in the province. Different scenarios were investigated on the basis of varying assumptions regarding drug resistance, adherence to HAART, therapeutic guidelines, degree of HAART coverage, and the timing of HAART uptake. Expansion of HAART lead to substantial reductions in the growth of the HIV epidemic and related costs. These results provide powerful additional motivation to accelerate the roll out of HAART programs aggressively targeting those in medical need, both for their own benefit and as a means of decreasing new HIV infections."
4518,0.002,2.0,"The association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and glomerulonephritis is well known. However, the relationship between immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV, characterized by the presence of HCV-RNA in liver or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of serological markers, is unknown. We tested this in 113 anti-HCV-negative patients; 87 with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and 26 controls with hereditary glomerular nephropathies. All patients were serum HCV-RNA negative by conventional real-time PCR. Significantly, occult HCV-RNA (detectable viral RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in serum after ultracentrifugation) was found in 34 of 87 patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus 1 of 26 control patients. The serum creatinine levels were significantly higher in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with than in those without occult HCV (1.5 versus 1.1 mg/dl, respectively). A multivariate analysis adjusted for gender showed a significantly increased risk of occult HCV in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis versus the controls (odds ratio of 13.29). Progression to end-stage renal disease tended to be faster in patients with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and occult HCV than in the negative cases. Thus, occult HCV is strongly associated with immune-mediated glomerulonephritis and may have a role in the progression of the disease."
1220,0.002,2.0,"Occult hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a new entity that should be considered when diagnosing patients with abnormal liver functions of unknown origin. This work was carried out to evaluate T-helper 1/T-helper 2 (Th1/Th2) cytokine profiles in patients with occult HCV infection versus chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection, also to investigate any association between theses cytokines and liver histological features in both groups. Serum levels of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) were measured in 35 patients with occult HCV infection compared to 50 patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and 30 healthy controls. We have found that Th1 cytokines were significantly increased in patients with CHC infection than in both occult HCV infection and control groups (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, serum IL-4 levels were higher in occult HCV infection than in CHC and control groups (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, serum IL-10 levels were higher in both patient groups vs control group (pless than 0.001), with no significant difference between CHC and occult HCV groups. Finally, only serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher among patients with high activity (A2-A3) than those with low activity (A0-A1) in both CHC and occult HCV groups (p=0.038, p=0.025, respectively). Patients with occult HCV infection exhibited a distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern that is shifted towards the Th2 arm. "

Longitudinal data were used to investigate the relationship between initiating HCV treatment and adherence to ART in HIV/HCV coinfected patients."
2262,0.002,2.0,"Most human T cell lymphotropic virus type (HTLV)-1-infected individuals mount a strong and persistently activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the virus, which implies that there is abundant chronic transcription of HTLV-1 genes. On the other hand, several observations suggest that HTLV-1 might be latent in vivo and therefore not detectable by CTLs. To clarify these discrepancies, we quantified the frequency of provirus-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that were capable of expressing the HTLV-1 Tax protein, which is known to be the immunodominant target antigen recognized by HTLV-1-specific CTLs. The analysis showed that a significant proportion of HTLV-1-infected cells (from 14 to 100%) starts to express the Tax protein within a few hours of culture ex vivo. Phenotypic analysis confirmed that the main cell subpopulation expressing the Tax protein is CD4 positive. Frequent Tax expression in CD4(+) T lymphocytes in vivo might account for the chronic activation of the cytotoxic immune response observed in the majority of HTLV-1-infected patients and might contribute to the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated diseases."
8699,0.002,2.0,"Identification of recent infections (RI) may contribute to improve the quality of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) surveillance, monitoring ongoing transmission and planning and evaluating prevention programs. Our study applied an algorithm combining clinical and serological information to identify RI in individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in Rome, during the years 1999-2008, in order to describe the trend and characteristics of recently infected individuals. RI were documented seroconverters, or people with an HIV avidity index (AI)<0.80. Individuals with advanced infection (CD4 count <200 cells/?L or AIDS-defining illness) or with AI ?0.80 were considered long-standing infections. Overall, we observed 2,563 new HIV diagnoses. The algorithm was applied in 2124/2563 (82.9%). Of these, 355 were RI (16.7%). RI was found independently associated with calendar year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]= 1.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=[CI 1.02-1.11], for every year of increase), HIV-risk category (men having sex with men: aOR=1.44, [CI 1.04-1.98]; injecting drug users: aOR=1.58, [CI 1.03-2.42] vs. heterosexuals), country of origin (foreign-born: vs Italians: aOR=0.46, [CI 0.33-0.62]), and recruitment site (inpatient vs outpatient clinic: aOR=0.49, [CI 0.37-0.66]). By the application of our algorithm we could characterize the pattern of ongoing HIV transmission, identifying groups needing more urgent prevention programs."
1561,0.002,2.0,"Genotype data for CCR5, CCR2, and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) were obtained from 354 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive subjects who were being treated with nucleosides. Associations with HIV-1 load, HIV syncytium-inducing (SI) phenotype, CD4 cell count, and disease progression were analyzed. No differences in HIV-1 load or CD4 cell count were observed between wild type (+) and variant genotypes. Changes from non-SI to SI viral phenotype were more frequent in heterozygotes with a 32-bp deletion (Delta32) in the CCR5 gene than in + homozygotes (40% vs. 7%; P=.01). In a multivariate analysis, heterozygous CCR5 Delta32 was associated with reduced hazard of progression (hazard ratio, 0.32; P=.02). Subjects homozygous for the SDF-1 3'A variant had more-rapid disease progression (P=.008). The SDF-1 homozygous 3'A variant was related to more-rapid disease progression, and CCR5 Delta32 was associated with reduced rates of hazard for disease progression in nucleoside-treated subjects."
8858,0.002,2.0,"The phenomenon of interference was exploited to isolate low-abundance noncytopathic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants from a primary HIV-1 isolate from an asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive hemophiliac. Successive rounds of virus infection of a cytolysis-susceptible CD4+ cell line and isolation of surviving cells resulted in selective amplification of an HIV-1 variant reduced in the ability to induce cytolysis. The presence of a PvuII polymorphism facilitated subsequent amplification and cloning of cytopathic and noncytopathic HIV-1 variants from the primary isolate. Cloned virus stocks from cytopathic and noncytopathic variants exhibited similar replication kinetics, infectivity, and syncytium induction in susceptible host cells. The noncytopathic HIV-1 variant was unable, however, to induce single-cell killing in susceptible host cells. Construction of viral hybrids in which regions of cytopathic and noncytopathic variants were exchanged indicated that determinants for the noncytopathic phenotype map to the envelope glycoprotein. Sequence analysis of the envelope coding regions indicated the absence of two highly conserved N-linked glycosylation sites in the noncytopathic HIV-1 variant, which accompanied differences in processing of precursor gp160 envelope glycoprotein. These results demonstrate that determinants for syncytium-independent single-cell killing are located within the envelope glycoprotein and suggest that single-cell killing is profoundly influenced by alterations in envelope sequence which affect posttranslational processing of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein within the infected cell."

1316,0.002,2.0,"Project HEART, an acronym for Helping Enhance Adherence to Retroviral Therapy, was a prospective, controlled study to develop, implement, and evaluate a clinic-based behavioural intervention to prevent adherence failure among HIV-infected adults beginning their first highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen (N = 227). In this paper, we describe the conceptualisation of the Project HEART adherence intervention, characteristics of the participants, and lessons learned implementing HEART in an inner-city clinic setting. A multi-component intervention, HEART combined enhanced education, reminders, adherence feedback, social support and adherence-focused problem solving in an integrated manner to address common cognitive, motivational, and social barriers to adherence. Unique components of the intervention included use of participant-identified adherence support partners and a standardized adherence barriers assessment to develop and implement individualised adherence plans. Lessons learned regarding the feasibility of using participant-identified support partners were as follows. Few participants eligible for the study had trouble identifying a support partner. Over 90% of support partners attended at least one intervention visit. Support partners were most available and amenable to participate early in the initiation of therapy. Participants' experiences as the 'supported' partner were generally positive. Though many participants faced barriers not easily addressed by this intervention (for example, housing instability), formally integrating support partners into the intervention helped to address many other common adherence barriers. Family and friends are an under-utilised resource in HIV medication adherence. Enlisting the help of support partners is a practical and economical approach to adherence counselling."

We examined the relationship between patient understanding of HIV and its treatment and health literacy. Structured interviews were conducted with 157 HIV-infected individuals receiving care at a community-based clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. In all, 48% of patients were reading below a 9th grade level. One-third of patients could not name their HIV medications and this was significantly related to low literacy (P < 0.01). Two-thirds of those reading below the 9th grade level did not know how to take their medications correctly (P < 0.05), and 75% did not know the meaning of a CD4 count or viral load (P < 0.001). Patients with low literacy skills were more likely to state that their physician was their sole source of HIV information (P < 0.005).

2958,0.002,2.0,"The life expectancy of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission has important clinical and public health significance. Several sources of population-based surveillance data from New York City, covering 1982 through the end of 1994, were combined to estimate long-term survival of HIV-infected children and age-specific prevalence. HIV incidence among newborns was estimated by applying expected transmission rates to seroprevalence surveys of parturient women and by using back-calculation methods. HIV prevalence in childhood was based on cumulative HIV incidence and cumulative mortality, adjusting for underreporting of death and background causes of death. A modified actuarial method was developed to estimate survival of infected children. At the beginning of 1995, between 1,945 and 3,323 children less than age 13 years were estimated to be living with HIV infection acquired through mother-to-child transmission in New York City. Between 36% and 61% of these infected children were estimated to survive to age 13 years (median survival, 8.6 years to >13 years). A substantial proportion of infected children will survive to adolescence. Thus, it is important that their educational, medical, and other needs be considered. These methods may be useful in other areas in which HIV seroprevalence data among childbearing women and HIV mortality statistics are available."
1310,0.002,2.0,"Incidence rates of AIDS illnesses are described among patients with < or = 100 CD4 cells/mm3 grouped by use of antiretrovirals and chemoprophylaxis. Data were obtained from 2646 homosexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Participants were in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during 1985-1993. The incidence rates per 100 person-years for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were 47.4 without treatment, 21.5 with antiretrovirals alone, and 12.8 with antiretrovirals combined with chemoprophylaxis. For Kaposi's sarcoma these rates were 23.2, 11.3, and 15.1, respectively. The incidence of some opportunistic infections, including Mycobacterium avium complex, nonretinitis cytomegalovirus disease, and cytomegalovirus retinitis, increased among persons receiving P. carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, because of reduction of this pneumonia and extension of life span. The incidence pattern of AIDS-defining illnesses in patients receiving treatment points to the changing AIDS epidemic and the need for new therapies. The data are particularly relevant to the development and planning of clinical trials and to health care providers."

The most common chest x-ray abnormality was a reticulonodular pattern or bilateral infiltrates (n=26). Serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were elevated in 17 (85%) of 20 of patients tested (mean value, 2208 U/L). Mean O(2) saturation and PO(2) were 89% and 64 mm Hg, respectively. A majority (24 patients [62%]) received both antituberculous and anti-PCP therapy (17 with steroids), and 22 improved. All ten patients who received no treatment for PCP improved and were discharged from the hospital, whereas 4 (80%) of the 5 persons who received no antituberculous treatment had a poor outcome (P<.001; OR=43). Patients with HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome may present with both TB and PCP; of the 2, TB seems to account for the most severe features of disease."
9762,0.002,2.0,"The pathologic findings from biopsy or autopsy material in four patients, who were vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at birth in Chile, are presented. Two patients had severe combined immunodeficiency, and two had more restricted cellular (T-cell) immunodeficiency with no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. The patients had distinct skin nodules and nodular lesions in systemic organs and bone marrow. Three patients had regional BCG lymphadenitis. One patient with severe combined immunodeficiency, however, had disseminated BCG without any local reaction. In all cases BCG strains of Mycobacterium were identified in a reference mycobacteriology laboratory. The histologic lesions in most patients usually consisted of diffuse histiocytic infiltrates with poorly formed granulomas and variable or no necrosis. Histiocytes were plump and engorged with numerous acid-fast bacilli (AFB). In some areas the massive histiocytosis resembled a spindle cell neoplasm. Other histologic findings supported the underlying immunodeficiency. The pattern of histiocytic response and degree of microbial killing depend on the host's immunocompetence. In the later stages of disease or in severe immunodeficiency, there is a lack of granuloma formation and unimpeded proliferation of AFB. These findings are reminiscent of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in AIDS patients. Bacillus Calmette-Guèrin dissemination has to be considered in immunocompromised individuals when the patient comes from other countries in which such vaccinations are practiced."
5329,0.002,2.0,"This study reports clinical features, with emphasis on oral lesions and constitutional signs, of 170 patients in a regional hospital in northern Vietnam, of whom 56 were HIV positive. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relationship of oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) and oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) with HIV infection and late stage HIV disease. Late stage HIV disease was defined as WHO stage III or IV and/or a total lymphocyte count below 1200 cells/mm3. The 56 HIV positive patients included all patients with a positive HIV test between July 7th and September 9th 2002. A total of 114 HIV negative controls were included as well. All patients had a detailed medical history and examination as well as a thorough oral examination, which were all done without prior knowledge of the patient's HIV serostatus. HIV positive patients were then grouped according to WHO clinical stage and total lymphocyte count. Thirty-six patients (64.3%) out of 56 HIV positives were in WHO stage III+IV and 28 patients (50.0%) had a total lymphocyte count below 1200 cells/mm3. The presence of OPC, weight loss of more than 10% of body weight and/or chronic fever of more than one month's duration showed a significant association and high positive prediction with HIV infection, especially late stage HIV disease [all with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI > 1)]. The presence of OHL only showed a significant association with positive HIV serostatus and WHO stage III+IV. It can be concluded that in North Vietnam, HIV positive patients and patients suspected of having HIV infection would benefit from initial and repeat oral examinations. OPC, together with other signs of progressive infection (constitutional signs, such as weight loss and chronic fever) may serve as indicators for institution of prophylactic drugs against opportunistic infections and even antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, when available. However, further research is needed to demonstrate the role of OHL in HIV patients in North Vietnam."

7203,0.002,2.0,"Injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other blood-borne pathogens. In the United States, IDUs account for nearly one-third of the cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), either directly or indirectly (heterosexual and perinatal cases of AIDS where the source of infection was an IDU). IDU also account for a substantial proportion of cases of hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections. The primary mode of transmission of HIV among IDUs is parenteral, through direct needle sharing or multiperson use of syringes. Despite high levels of knowledge about risk, multiperson use of needles and syringes is due primarily to fear of arrest and incarceration for violation of drug paraphernalia laws and ordinances that prohibit manufacture, sale, distribution, or possession of equipment and materials intended to be used with narcotics. It is estimated that in 1997 there were approximately 110 needle exchange programs (NEPs) in North America. In part, because of the ban on the use of Federal funds for the operation of needle exchange, it has been difficult to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. This chapter presents data from the studies that have evaluated the role of NEPs in HIV prevention. Evidence for the efficacy of NEPs comes from three source: (1) studies originally focused on the effectiveness of NEPs in non-HIV blood-borne infections, (2) mathematical modeling of data on needle exchange on HIV seroincidence, and (3) studies that examine the positive and negative impact of NEPs on HIV and AIDS. Case-control studies have provided powerful data on the positive effect of NEPs on reduction of two blood-borne viral infections (HBV and HCV) For example, a case-control study in Tacoma, Washington, showed that a six-fold increase in HBV and a seven-fold increase in HCV infections in IDUs were associated with nonuse of the NEP. The first federally funded study of needle exchange was an evaluation of the New Haven NEP, which is legally operated by the New Haven Health Department. Rather than relying on self-report of reduced risky injection drug use, this study utilized mathematical and statistical modeling, using data from a syringe tracking and testing system. Incidence of HIV infection among needle exchange participants was estimated to have decreased by 33% as a result of the NEP. A series of Government-commissioned reports have reviewed the data on positive and negative outcomes of NEPs. The major reports are from the National Commission on AIDS; the U.S. General Accounting Office; the Centers for Disease Control/University of California; and the National Academy of Sciences. The latter two reports are used in this chapter. The aggregated results support the positive benefit of NEPs and do not support negative outcomes from NEPs. When legal restrictions on both purchase and possession of syringes are removed, IDUs will change their syringe-sharing behaviors in ways that can reduce HIV transmission. NEPs do not result in increased drug use among participants or the recruitment of first-time drug users."
125,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide, frequently leading to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Evidence suggests that high viral antigen load may play a role in chronicity. Production of viral proteins is thought to depend on transcription of viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). In a human clinical trial with an RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapeutic targeting HBV transcripts, ARC-520, HBV S antigen (HBsAg) was strongly reduced in treatment-naïve patients positive for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) but was reduced significantly less in patients who were HBeAg-negative or had received long-term therapy with nucleos(t)ide viral replication inhibitors (NUCs). HBeAg positivity is associated with greater disease risk that may be moderately reduced upon HBeAg loss. The molecular basis for this unexpected differential response was investigated in chimpanzees chronically infected with HBV. Several lines of evidence demonstrated that HBsAg was expressed not only from the episomal cccDNA minichromosome but also from transcripts arising from HBV DNA integrated into the host genome, which was the dominant source in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees. Many of the integrants detected in chimpanzees lacked target sites for the small interfering RNAs in ARC-520, explaining the reduced response in HBeAg-negative chimpanzees and, by extension, in HBeAg-negative patients. Our results uncover a heretofore underrecognized source of HBsAg that may represent a strategy adopted by HBV to maintain chronicity in the presence of host immunosurveillance. These results could alter trial design and endpoint expectations of new therapies for chronic HBV."
3397,0.002,2.0,"Highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proven remarkably effective for prolonging the life of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, while most HAART agents are safe, many have the potential to cause liver toxicity. Physicians must therefore consider the possibility of drug-induced liver injury in the management of HIV-infected patients, especially those with certain risk factors such as coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), female gender, alcohol abuse, older age, or obesity. Understanding how, when, and why drug-related liver damage occurs is key to managing these patients safely and effectively. Knowledge of HAART-related liver effects will help ensure that patients receive the most benefit with the least toxicity from any given drug regimen. As more information about the mechanisms of drug related liver injury is known, clinicians will be better able to tailor therapies to suit individual situations, resulting in greater patient safety and outcomes."

HBV DNA was checked in 20 patients with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma without any known etiology, and 10 apparently healthy subjects with elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). HBV DNA was detected in 8 of 20 patients with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis, 1 of 10 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 2 of 10 apparent healthy subjects with elevated ALT. However, all of them were negative for HBsAg in the sera. This study indicates that some additional mechanisms should be developed for detection of HBsAg-negative HBV-infected subjects for efficient control and management of HBV infection in Bangladesh."
1500,0.002,2.0,"Anemia is often a comorbidity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Many cross-sectional studies have been conducted on anemia and HIV, but few, if any, have addressed incidence of anemia prospectively. A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 48,068 nonpregnant HIV-infected adults in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, seen at Management and Development for Health-U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief HIV care and treatment programs between 2004 and 2011. Almost 56% (N = 27,184) of study participants had anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) at the time of enrollment at the clinic. Female gender, low body mass index (BMI), low CD4 T-cell count, high levels of liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase, antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens, and concurrent tuberculosis treatment were all independently significantly associated with an increased risk of anemia. Low BMI and low CD4 T-cell count were independently significantly associated with an increased risk for iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Higher BMI status and ART use were associated with recovery from anemia. Anemia, including IDA, is a comorbidity that is associated with other adverse consequences (e.g., low BMI and CD4 T-cell count) among individuals with HIV infection, including those on ART. Interventions to prevent anemia and its complications need to be examined in the context of future studies. "
966,0.002,2.0,"Sixty-seven patients with different stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (47 CDC group IV, 20 CDC groups II or III) were followed prospectively for a median of 18 months with neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computerized tomography (CT) to evaluate the incidence of the AIDS dementia complex (CDC definition) and other neurological complications. Ten patients developed CNS opportunistic infection or malignancy. Among the remaining 57 patients, 12 of 37 (32%) belonging to CDC group IV, and 1 of 20 (5%) belonging to CDC groups II/III developed the AIDS dementia complex (p = 0.03). MRI white matter lesions occurred in 32% of CDC group IV patients and 5% of CDC groups II/III patients (p = 0.03). The corresponding figures for brain atrophy at CT were 71% and 30% (p less than 0.01) and for neurologic signs 49% and 20% (p = 0.06). The development of the AIDS dementia complex was significantly associated with the occurrence of MRI white matter lesions and a CD4 cell count of less than 200 x 10(6)/l, whereas it was not statistical significantly associated with brain atrophy at baseline. It is concluded that the AIDS dementia complex is a common feature of late stage HIV infection. Brain atrophy occurs in a large percentage of HIV infected patients, but the clinical significance of this atrophy is not clear."
9579,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human T lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infections have complex effects on adaptive immunity, with specific tropism for, but contrasting effects on, CD4 T lymphocytes: depletion with HIV-1, proliferation with HTLV-1. Impaired T lymphocyte function occurs early in HIV-1 infection but opportunistic infections (OIs) rarely occur in the absence of CD4 lymphopenia. In the unusual case where a HIV-1 infected individual with a high CD4 count presents with recurrent OIs, a clinician is faced with the possibility of a second underlying comorbidity. We present a case of pseudo-adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in HIV-1/HTLV-1 coinfection where the individual fulfilled Shimoyama criteria for chronic ATLL and had pulmonary Mycobacterium kansasii, despite a high CD4 lymphocyte count. However, there was no evidence of clonal T-cell proliferation by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies nor of monoclonal HTLV-1 integration by high-throughput sequencing. Mutually beneficial interplay between HIV-1 and HTLV-1, maintaining high level HIV-1 and HTLV-1 viremia and proliferation of poorly functional CD4 cells despite chronicity of infection is a postulated mechanism. Despite good microbiological response to antimycobacterial therapy, the patient remained systemically unwell with refractory anemia. Subsequent initiation of combined antiretroviral therapy led to paradoxical resolution of CD4 T lymphocytosis as well as HIV-1 viral suppression and decreased HTLV-1 proviral load. This is proposed to be the result of attenuation of immune activation post-HIV virological control. This case illustrates the importance of screening for HTLV-1 in HIV-1 patients with appropriate clinical presentation and epidemiological risk factors and explores mechanisms for the complex interactions on HIV-1/HTLV-1 adaptive immunity."
4702,0.002,2.0,"The effect of host cell factors on infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was studied by infecting a monoblastoid cell line (U937) or a T-cell line (MOLT-4) with a highly infective single clone of HIV-1 and comparing the infectivity of the produced viruses to different cell lines. Chronically infected U937 cells consistently produced viruses with minimal infectivity. This phenotypic change was host-dependent as the back-passage of the U937-produced low infective viruses into MOLT-4 cells resulted in regaining their original high infectivity. Southern and Northern blot analyses of the HIV-1 grown in U937 cells did not reveal any genomic difference between it and the virus grown it MOLT-4 cells. The radioimmunoprecipitation analysis of viral proteins showed that the HIV-1-infected U937 cells had a different pattern of envelope glycoproteins and core proteins, which well correlated with the low infectivity of the produced viruses. This experimental system using MOLT-4 and U937 cell lines would be useful to further explore host cell factor(s) which play an important role in the regulation of HIV-1 infectivity."
248,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in the levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding proteins (BP) 1, 2, and 3 in HIV-infected adults throughout the course of their disease, and to assess the responsiveness of the IGF system components to growth hormone (GH) administration (6 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Healthy control study subjects (n = 10) were compared with patients who were either HIV-positive (n = 9), had AIDS without weight loss (n = 13), or had AIDS with >10% weight loss (n = 6), all of whom had been free of acute illness for at least 3 months. Under basal conditions, fasting serum concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, insulin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were not significantly different among the four groups. The serum concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 were significantly higher in AIDS patients with wasting than in the other three groups (p < .05). In addition, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the levels of IGFBP- 1 (p = .004) and IGFBP-2 (p = .03) and the stage of disease. Following GH administration, the serum concentrations of insulin and IGF-I were increased in all groups (p < .05). In addition, the increases in insulin levels correlated with stage of disease (p = .004). The responses of the IGFBPs were more variable. GH administration significantly increased the levels of IGFBP-3 in all groups except the patients with AIDS wasting, whereas the levels of IGFBP-1 were significantly decreased in controls and AIDS patients. These results demonstrate that there is a continuum of both elevations in the IGFBPs and altered metabolic responsiveness in patients infected with HIV that increases with the severity of the disease. These data also demonstrate that AIDS patients, who are free from secondary infection, respond to administration of GH by significantly increasing hepatic IGF-I production."
7481,0.002,2.0,"We evaluated the replication and resistance patterns of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) strains recovered from HIV-infected patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who were receiving chemotherapy (CT) concomitant with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We analyzed virological response to HAART in 35 patients with HIV and NHL who were treated with a cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone chemotherapy regimen and HAART and the virological response in 26 HIV-infected patients with CD20 cell-positive NHL who were treated with rituximab and cyclophosphamide-doxorubin-etoposide therapy. Genotype and virtual phenotype analyses were performed at baseline and when virological failure occurred. Only 9 patients met the criteria for virological failure. Genotype and virtual phenotype analyses demonstrated that, during CT administration, new mutations might occur, but there were no significant changes in the preexisting resistance patterns. Our data show that combination therapy consisting of CT and HAART is feasible and that the virological response can be maintained in the majority of patients receiving this treatment."
5244,0.002,2.0,"Results from 2 placebo-controlled intensification trials of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) in treatment-experienced human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients (n=332) were integrated to determine the effects of resistance at baseline on HIV-1 RNA response. In these trials, there was a high prevalence of HIV-1 resistance mutations, with 94% of patients having nucleoside-associated mutations and 71% having thymidine analogue-associated mutations (TAMs). Statistically significant HIV-1 RNA reductions associated with tenofovir DF treatment, relative to placebo (P<.001), were observed for patients without TAMs (n=97) or for patients with 1-2 (n=88) or >or=3 TAMs (n=147). Response to tenofovir DF was reduced among patients with HIV-1 with >or=3 TAMs inclusive of either the M41L or L210W mutation (n=86) or patients who had a preexisting K65R mutation (n=6). Slightly increased treatment responses were observed when the M184V mutation was present. Phenotypic cutoffs were established at 1.4-fold and 4-fold, respectively, for the beginning of reduced response to tenofovir DF and for a strongly reduced response. The results from these controlled clinical trials provide guidance for the use of tenofovir DF for treatment-experienced patients."
288,0.002,2.0,"Rilpivirine (RPV), the latest nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor active against HIV-1, is prescribed in a standard dosage of 25 mg once a day in combination with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The aim of this observational study was to characterize the RPV pharmacokinetic profile, to quantify interpatient variability, and to identify potential factors that could influence drug exposure. RPV concentration data were collected from HIV-infected patients as part of routine therapeutic drug monitoring performed in our center (Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology). A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM by comparing various structural models. The influence of demographic and clinical covariates, as well as frequent genetic polymorphisms in 5 genes (CYP3A4*22, CYP3A5*3, CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*17, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A4*2), on RPV elimination was explored. A total of 325 plasma concentration measurements were obtained from 249 HIV-positive patients. Plasma concentrations ranged from 12 to 255 ng/ml. A one-compartment model with zero-order absorption best characterized RPV pharmacokinetics. The average RPV clearance (CL) was 11.7 liters/h, the average volume of distribution was 401 liters, and the mean absorption time was 4 h. The interinterindividual variability (IIV) for CL was estimated to be 33%. None of the available demographic or genetic covariates showed any influence on RPV pharmacokinetics, but 29% of the patients were predicted to present minimal concentrations below the recently identified target cutoff value of 50 ng/ml. The variability in RPV pharmacokinetics appears to be lower than that for most other antiretroviral drugs. However, under the standard regimen of 25 mg daily, a significant number of patients might be underdosed. It remains to be investigated whether the underexposure has an impact on the development of resistance while patients are on maintenance therapy."
8937,0.002,2.0,"Polymorphisms of chemokines and chemokine-receptors genes have been shown to influence the rate of progression to AIDS; however, their influence on response to HAART remains unclear. We investigated the frequency of the SDF-1-3'A, CCR2-64I, CCR5-D32 and CCR5-Promoter-59029-A/G polymorphisms in Brazilian HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals and their influence on CD4+ T-cell evolution HIV-1 infected individuals before and during HAART. Polymorphism detection was done in a transversal study of 200 HIV-1-infected and 82 uninfected individuals. The rate of CD4+ T cell increase or decrease was studied in a cohort of 155 HIV-1 infected individuals on pre and post-HAART. Polymorphisms were determined by PCR associated with RFLP. The rate of CD4+ T-cell decline or increase was also determined. HIV-1 infected and uninfected subjects showed, respectively, frequencies of 0.193 and 0.220 for SDF-1-3'A, of 0.140 and 0.110 for CCR2-V64I, of 0.038 and 0.055 for CCR5-D32, and of 0.442 and 0.390 for CCR5-P-59029-A/G. HIV-1-infected subjects carrying one, two or three of these four polymorphisms showed better CD4+ T-cell recovery than HIV-1-infected subjects carrying the four wild-type alleles (+2.7, +1.6, +3.5, and -0.9 lymphocytes/microl/month, respectively). Regression logistic analysis showed that the CCR5-D32/CCR2-V64I association was predictor of positive CD4+ T cell slope after HAART. The distribution of polymorphisms did not differ between HIV-1-infected and uninfected individuals, but differed from more homogenous ethnic groups probably reflecting the miscegenation of the Brazilian population. We add further evidence of the role of these polymorphisms by showing that the CD4 gain was influenced by carriage of one or more of the polymorphisms studied here. These results highlight the possibility that these genetic traits can be useful to identify patients at risk for faster progression to AIDS or therapeutic failure."
304,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) has been recognized as a major health problem worldwide. Greece belongs to the intermediate endemicity countries with a trend of decreasing prevalence of HBV infection during the last decade. However, the recent massive immigration to our country may have led to alterations of HBV epidemiology. In this study, we evaluated the epidemiological features of HBV infection in a sample of 3480 patients followed up during the years 1997-2006. Immigrants mainly from Albania represented the 18.6% of the total study population and 56.6% of children. The majority of the patients had no family history of HBV infection (67.3%) or of acute hepatitis (95.4%), no known source of infection (64.6%), with intrafamilial spread accounting for 16.9% of the HBV transmission in adults and 33.9% in children. HBeAg(-) hepatitis B was the predominant form of hepatitis (92.1%) among the Greek patients in contrast to the immigrants where 16.6% were HBeAg(+). Liver cirrhosis was diagnosed in 8.8% of the total population and 0.9% had hepatocellular carcinoma. A high proportion of children were HBeAg(+) (62%), 55% from immigrant families, 25.2% were infected in the perinatal period and had no evidence of disease complications. In conclusion our results showed (a) a changing pattern in the epidemiology of HBV infection in Greece due to the significant number of HBeAg(+) patients, especially among children and (b) a considerable number of patients although aware of their infection, present with advanced disease."
8162,0.002,2.0,"A persistent form of the hepatitis B virus called occult chronic hepatitis B has recently been described. Its prevalence and physiopathology are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of this clinical entity among patients in the Brazilian Amazon region. Out of 51 anti-HBc total-positive patients who were tested using the polymerase chain reaction, 17% were positive. We did not find any associations with classical risk factors for hepatitis B virus infection or with biochemical tests, hematological tests or histological patterns. However, the jaundiced and HIV-positive patients showed a statistical association with the presence of hepatitis B virus-DNA. The results demonstrated that occult hepatitis B occurred among our patients, but at prevalence rates lower than expected for this region. We believe that despite the small sample size, the occurrence might have been found to be greater if we had used primers for the S, C and X regions of the hepatitis B virus genome, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the test."
6656,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was found to replicate in monocytes/macrophages particularly in patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This study was undertaken to determine whether HIV facilitates HCV infection of native human macrophages in vitro. Monocytes/macrophages were collected from healthy donors, infected with HIV M-tropic molecular clone, and then exposed to HCV-positive sera. Presence of positive and negative HCV RNA strands was determined with a novel strand-specific quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Preceding as well as near-simultaneous infection with HIV made the macrophages more susceptible to infection with HCV; in particular, an HCV RNA-negative strand was detectable almost exclusively in the setting of concomitant HIV infection. Furthermore, HCV RNA load correlated with HIV replication level in the early stage of infection. The ratio of positive to negative strand in macrophages was lower than in control liver samples. HIV infection was also found to facilitate HCV replication in a Daudi B-cell line with engineered CD4 expression. It seems that HIV infection can facilitate replication of HCV in monocytes/macrophages either by rendering cells more susceptible to HCV infection or by increasing HCV replication. This could explain the presence of extrahepatic HCV replication in HIV-coinfected individuals."
2130,0.002,2.0,"A simple, sensitive and accurate plaque assay was developed using HPB-Ma, a variant of the human T-cell line HPB-ALL, which becomes adherent to the substratum after infection with an amphotropic murine sarcoma virus (MSVa). The simplicity of this novel plaque assay allowed us to examine a large number of serum samples from patients with HIV infection for neutralizing antibody activity against two human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) strains. During the progression of clinical disease, the neutralizing activity in the sera from two individual patients remained unchanged or increased. A patient with a known time of HIV infection produced cross-neutralizing antibody at 25-34 weeks. The neutralizing activity in the sera from 17 asymptomatic carriers, four patients with AIDS-related complex and four AIDS patients was also examined and was found to be unrelated to the clinical stage."
3070,0.002,2.0,"We have previously described the development of a lipopeptide-based vaccine, Theradigm-HBV, capable of inducing CTL responses in humans. This vaccine incorporates the HLA-A2.1-restricted CTL epitope hepatitis B core Ag 18-27, linked to the universal helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitope tetanus toxoid (TT) 830-843. Herein, we report the results of a phase I trial designed to examine the effects of Theradigm-HBV dose and regimen on the magnitude and duration of the memory CTL response. A total of four injections of up to 5 mg/dose were found to be a safe and effective means of generating substantial memory CTL responses. Precursor frequency analysis demonstrated CTL responses of similar magnitude to those previously observed in patients who successfully cleared hepatitis B virus infection and to influenza-specific memory CTL responses induced by natural exposure to influenza virus. Theradigm-HBV induced CTL responses that persisted for more than 9 months after the last injection. HTL responses were associated with significant CTL responses, and sustained HTL activity was necessary for development of persistent memory CTL activity. These results represent the first demonstration of the importance of HTL activity for development of long-lived memory CTL responses in humans. In conclusion, our results show that lipopeptides safely induce specific CTL activity in humans of such magnitude and persistence as to be of potential therapeutic significance."

1519,0.002,2.0,"In the current study we investigated 213 randomly selected Hungarian patients diagnosed with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS). All patients were monitored for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and 13 were positive. We compared HCV-negative and -positive patients and made observations on how HCV infection alters the clinical and laboratory features of Sjögren's syndrome. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that HCV infection is more frequent in Hungarian SS patients than in the normal population and that the presence of this virus has a disease-modifying effect on SS."
4488,0.002,2.0,"A case of a false-positive result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) confirmatory immunoblot-based assay is described. Repeatedly borderline reactive anti-HIV screening enzyme immunoassay result obtained in a local hospital resulted in directing the sample to the Slovenian HIV/AIDS Reference Laboratory. In the Reference Laboratory, both anti-HIV screening assays and confirmatory Western blot were negative, while a confirmatory test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) was anti-HIV-1 positive due to sgp120 and gp41 reactivity. The results of serological testing of the second sample obtained three weeks later were completely identical, while in the third sample obtained 5 months later, seroreversion was observed. Due to a negative dynamics in anti-HIV serological profile and repeatedly negative results of the molecular tests for HIV-1 and HIV-2, HIV infection was excluded and the results of test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score were finally interpreted as false positive."
9282,0.002,2.0,"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections are acquired via mucosal surfaces, and transmitted viruses are nearly always macrophage-tropic, suggesting that mucosal macrophages participate in early HIV-1 infection. Mucosal lymphocytes isolated from normal human intestine expressed CD4 (14,530+/-7970 antibody-binding sites [ABSs]/cell), CCR5 (2730+/-1524 ABSs/cell), and CXCR4 (2507+/-1840 ABSs/cell), but intestinal macrophages, which also expressed CD4 (2959+/-2695 ABSs/cell), displayed no detectable CCR5 or CXCR4 ABS. The absence of CCR5 on intestinal macrophages was not due to expression of the Delta32 deletion allele because matched-blood monocytes expressed CCR5. CCR5(+)CXCR4(+) intestinal lymphocytes supported both R5 (BaL) and X4 (IIIB) HIV-1 replication, whereas the CCR5(-)CXCR4(-) macrophages were not permissive to either isolate or other laboratory isolates (ADA and DJV) and primary isolates (MDR 24 and JOEL). In the intestinal mucosa, lymphocytes, not macrophages, are the likely target cell for R5 (and X4) HIV-1 and are the major source of HIV-1 production during early infection."
543,0.002,2.0,"Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced or primary cytotoxicity in vitro which is mediated by T lymphocytes, was studied during hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 45 hemodialysis patients, and related to liver cell damage and recovery. HBsAg positive patients with raised transaminases had increased primary cytotoxicity similar to nine otherwise healthy subjects with acute hepatitis B. HBsAg positive patients with normal transaminases showed decreased primary cytotoxicity and recovered patients showed normal values. Increased primary cytotoxicity could not be attributed to an increase in T lymphocytes, as all groups of hemodialysis patients had decreased lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte counts without significant differences between them. In the follow-up study none of the 13 HBsAg positive patients with normal transaminases recovered. However, five of the 18 patients with raised transaminases did recover from hepatitis B, accompanied by a decrease in cytotoxicity. These results show that an increased PHA-induced lymphocyte cytotoxicity corresponds with the occurrence of liver cell damage and subsequent recovery in hemodialysis patients with HBV infection. This suggests that cytotoxic T lymphocytes are involved in liver cell damage and recovery in HBV infection."
1101,0.002,2.0,"Little is known regarding the prevalence and distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos. We sought to determine the prevalence of HBV exposure (serum HBV core antibody; anti-HBc), active HBV infection (serum HBV surface antigen; HBsAg), and vaccine-induced HBV immunity (antibody against HBV surface antigen; anti-HBs) in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos and consider how these data inform clinical screening recommendations. Our analysis included 11,999 women and men of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), a population-based, household survey in four urban communities (Bronx, NY; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; and San Diego, CA) of U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized self-identifying Hispanic/Latino adults ages 18-74. Vaccine-induced immunity was defined as detection of anti-HBs, but not anti-HBc. However, if anti-HBc were present, it was considered evidence of exposure to HBV, with detection of HBsAg used to distinguish those with active HBV infection. Mean age was 45.7 years, and 7,153 were women. Vaccine-induced immunity was greatest among those ages 18-29 years (60.2% in women, 54% in men) and decreased with increasing age, regardless of country of birth. The prevalence of active HBV infection was 0.29% (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.43), but varied by country of birth. Those born in the Dominican Republic had the highest prevalence of HBV exposure (20.3% in women, 29.7% in men) and active HBV infection (0.95%)."
6653,0.002,2.0,"In South Africa, where it is estimated that more people have HIV than anywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS and psychological disorder co-morbidity have been shown both to exacerbate the late diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders and to affect adherence to ARVs. Targeted, affordable and evidence-based strategies to reach these populations are essential. Against this backdrop, a pilot project and situational assessment aimed at determining the context of psychological care and HIV treatment services in South Africa was undertaken. The situational analysis consisted of individual interviews, a patient survey, and a retrospective medical record data review. Training and mentorship were conducted from 2011 to 2013 by the Foundation for Professional Development (FPD) in five anti-retroviral therapy (ART) clinics in the Tshwane-Metsweding area. Data were both descriptively and inferentially analysed. Outcomes indicate that the general structure of HIV services is well organised and well run in the sampled clinics. However, mental healthcare and HIV services need to be integrated further. There is also a need to develop and pilot-test appropriate materials and models for the delivery of mental healthcare within the parameters of affordability, acceptability and availability further, and to advocate the advancement of mental health and HIV treatment and policy integration."
2340,0.002,2.0,"The ability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to prevent the onset of HIV-associated dementia and to prevent or reduce the neuropathological features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) remains unclear. Using a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model of HIVE, we determined the effects of regular HAART treatment on HIVE. Before studying HAART in infected SCID mice, nonmanipulated SCID mice were treated with a single injection of the HAART cocktail (consisting of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir) to determine optimum dosage and sampling time and to measure antiretroviral levels in the brain. After these preliminary studies, SCID mice that were inoculated with either HIV-infected or uninfected human monocytes were given intraperitoneal (IP) injections of HAART three times daily over a 1- and 2-week period. All three drugs were detected in the brain using a novel drug extraction technique and a modified high-performance liquid chromatography method. HAART significantly decreased the amount of astrogliosis and viral load in treated mice compared with mice that received vehicle injections. These studies offer insight into the ability of HAART to treat HIV infection of the brain."

However, late-presenting HIV-infected patients with CD4 T-cell counts<50 cells/microL are still common. The ability of long-term HAART to normalize immune dysregulation in severely immunodeficient HIV-infected patients remains unclear.

7345,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein modifications over the course of infection have been associated with coreceptor switching and antibody neutralization resistance, but the effect of the changes on replication and host cell receptor usage remains unclear. To examine this question, unique early- and chronic-stage infection envelope V1-to V5 (V1-V5) segments from eight HIV-1 subtype A-infected subjects were incorporated into an isogenic background to construct replication-competent recombinant viruses. In all subjects, viruses with chronic-infection V1-V5 segments showed greater replication capacity than those with early-infection V1-V5 domains in cell lines with high levels of both the CD4 and the CCR5 receptors. Viruses with chronic-infection V1-V5s demonstrated a significantly increased ability to replicate in cells with low CCR5 receptor levels and greater resistance to CCR5 receptor and fusion inhibitors compared to those with early-infection V1-V5 segments. These properties were associated with sequence changes in the envelope V1-V3 segments. Viruses with the envelope segments from the two infection time points showed no significant difference in their ability to infect cells with low CD4 receptor densities, in their sensitivity to soluble CD4, or in their replication capacity in monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results suggest that envelope changes, primarily in the V1-V3 domains, increase both the ability to use the CCR5 receptor and fusion kinetics. Thus, envelope modifications over time within a host potentially enhance replication capacity."
1276,0.002,2.0,"Prolonged antiretroviral treatment (ART) significantly changes the cytokine secretion capacities of HIV-1-specific T cells. However, it is unclear whether these changes result from decreased viremia or they correspond to true functional recovery of viral-specific immune response. To study this issue, we analysed the quantitative and qualitative differences of HIV-1-specific and polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between 26 naive and 52 treated individuals. HIV-1 Gag and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-reactive T cells were determined by flowcytometric intracellular secretion of IFN-γ or/and ΙL-2. ART resulted in increase of single IL-2 and decrease of single IFN-γ-secreting HIV-1 CD4+ T cells, while both cytokines secreting HIV-1 CD4+ T cells were presented in comparable frequencies in both groups. Viral loads correlated negatively with single IL-2 and positively with single IFN-γ-secreting HIV-1 CD4+ cells. Single IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cells correlated positively with both cytokines secreting polyclonal CD8+ T cells. By qualitative analysis, a dominant IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cell response (> 70% single IL-2) was identified only in ART suppressed patients, who also generated increased dual specific polyclonal CD8+ T cells. Polyfunctional HIV-1 CD4+ T cell responses were detected even in naive individuals with high viremia. In conclusion, the presence of dominant IL-2 HIV-1 CD4+ T cell response, associated with increased CD8+ T cells capable to produce IL-2, indicates that the recovery of HIV-1-specific CD4+ T cell functionality under ART is a feasible goal. Furthermore, polyfunctional HIV-1 CD4+ T cell responses seem not to be directly involved in viral replication control."
6395,0.002,2.0,"Infection of macaques with live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) usually results in long-lasting efficient protection against infection with pathogenic immunodeficiency viruses. However, attenuation by deletion of regulatory genes such as nef is not complete, leading to a high viral load and fatal disease in some animals. To characterize immunological parameters and polymorphic host factors, we studied 17 rhesus macaques infected with attenuated SIVmac239ΔNU. Eight animals were able to control viral replication, whereas the remaining animals (non-controllers) displayed variable set-point viral loads. Peak viral load at 2 weeks post-infection (p.i.) correlated significantly with set-point viral load (P<0.0001). CD4(+) T-cell frequencies differed significantly soon after infection between controllers and non-controllers. Abnormal B-cell activation previously ascribed to Nef function could already be observed in non-controllers 8 weeks after infection despite the absence of Nef. Two non-controllers developed an AIDS-like disease within 102 weeks p.i. Virus from these animals transmitted to naïve animals replicated at low levels and the recipients did not develop immunodeficiency. This suggested that host factors determined differential viral load and subsequent disease course. Known Mhc class I alleles associated with disease progression in SIV WT infection only marginally influenced the viral load in Δnef-infected animals. Protection from SIVmac251 was associated with homozygosity for MHC class II in conjunction with a TLR7 polymorphism and showed a trend with initial viral replication. We speculated that host factors whose effects were usually masked by Nef were responsible for the different disease courses in individual animals upon infection with nef-deleted viruses. "
8277,0.002,2.0,"In a recent vaccine trial, we showed efficient control of a virulent simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-89.6P challenge by priming with a Gag-Pol-Env-expressing DNA and boosting with a Gag-Pol-Env- expressing recombinant-modified vaccinia virus Ankara. Here we show that long-term control has been associated with slowly declining levels of viral RNA and DNA. In the vaccinated animals both viral DNA and RNA underwent an initial rapid decay, which was followed by a lower decay rate. Between 12 and 70 weeks postchallenge, the low decay rates have had half-lives of about 20 weeks for viral RNA in plasma and viral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes. In vaccinated animals the viral DNA has been mostly unintegrated and has appeared to be largely nonfunctional as evidenced by a poor ability to recover infectious virus in cocultivation assays, even after CD8 depletion. In contrast, in control animals, which have died, viral DNA was mostly integrated and a larger proportion appeared to be functional as evidenced by the recovery of infectious virus. Thus, to date, control of the challenge infection has appeared to improve with time, with the decay rates for viral DNA being at the lower end of values reported for patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy."

We evaluated the role of HCV NS3 antigen (HCV NS3Ag) on the prediction of virologic response in patients with HCV GT1b during PR or PR/simeprevir (triple) therapy. Three hundred patients were recruited, and HCV RNA and HCV NS3Ag were tested at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72. NS3Ag and HCV RNA were significantly related (r(2) = 0.67) in the whole patient selection. The kinetic pattern of HCV RNA and HCV NS3Ag during triple treatment was similar. HCV NS3Ag levels in the triple group closely followed those of HCV RNA; the r(2) values were 0.756 (baseline), 0.837 (2 weeks), 0.989 (4 weeks), and 0.993 (12 weeks), respectively. For patients treated with PR, the positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs) for viral response were 96.31 % and 67.19 %, respectively, at week 4 by using the decrease of NS3Ag (dHCV NS3Ag) combined with HCV RNA. At week 12, the PPV was similar at 94.16 %, while the NPV reached 87.26 %. The PPV and NPV for the prediction of relapse and breakthrough were 90.6 % and 76.7 %, respectively. HCV NS3Ag is a valuable marker and could be a supplementary predictor of HCV RNA for the prediction of antiviral response, breakthrough, or relapse during HCV antiviral treatment. "

This report describes the development and validation of a novel assay that offers a uniform method to measure susceptibility to all clinically approved HIV type 1 (HIV-1) drugs targeting reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR), integrase (IN), and viral entry. It is an assay in which the antiviral effect on infection within a single replication cycle is measured in triply transfected U87.CD4.CXCR4.CCR5 cells, based on homologous recombination between patient-derived amplicons and molecular proviral clones tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene and from which certain viral genomic regions are removed. The deletions stretch from p17 codon 7 to PR codon 98 in pNL4.3-DeltagagPR-EGFP, from PR codons 1 to 99 in pNL4.3-DeltaPR-EGFP, from RT codons 1 to 560 in pNL4.3-DeltaRT-EGFP, from IN codons 1 to 288 in pNL4.3-DeltaIN-EGFP, and from gp120 codon 34 to gp41 codon 237 in pNL4.3-Deltaenv-EGFP. The optimized experimental conditions enable the investigation of patient samples regardless of viral subtype or coreceptor use. The extraction and amplification success rate for a set of clinical samples belonging to a broad range of HIV-1 group M genetic forms (A-J, CRF01-03, CRF05, and CRF12-13) and displaying a viral load range of 200 to >500,000 RNA copies/ml was 97%. The drug susceptibility measurements, based on discrimination between infected and noninfected cells on a single-cell level by flow cytometry, were reproducible, with coefficients of variation for resistance ranging from 7% to 31%, and were consistent with scientific literature in terms of magnitude and specificity."
5184,0.002,2.0,"Suboptimal treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection with nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) often results in the rapid selection of drug-resistant virus. Several amino acid substitutions at position 190 of reverse transcriptase (RT) have been associated with reduced susceptibility to the NNRTI, especially nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV). In the present study, the effects of various 190 substitutions observed in viruses obtained from NNRTI-experienced patients were characterized with patient-derived HIV isolates and confirmed with a panel of isogenic viruses. Compared to wild-type HIV, which has a glycine at position 190 (G190), viruses with 190 substitutions (A, C, Q, S, V, E, or T, collectively referred to as G190X substitutions) were markedly less susceptible to NVP and EFV. In contrast, delavirdine (DLV) susceptibility of these G190X viruses increased from 3 to 300-fold (hypersusceptible) or was only slightly decreased. The replication capacity of viruses with certain 190 substitutions (C, Q, V, T, and E) was severely impaired and was correlated with reduced virion-associated RT activity and incomplete protease (PR) processing of the viral p55(gag) polyprotein. These defects were the result of inadequate p160(gagpol) incorporation into virions. Compensatory mutations within RT and PR improved replication capacity, p55(gag) processing, and RT activity, presumably through increased incorporation of p160(gagpol) into virions. We observe an inverse relationship between the degree of NVP and EFV resistance and the impairment of viral replication in viruses with substitutions at 190 in RT. These observations may have important implications for the future design and development of antiretroviral drugs that restrict the outgrowth of resistant variants with high replication capacity."
7141,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated cognitive impairment, a significant cause of morbidity, affects up to 30% of HIV-infected people. Its prevalence doubled as patients began to live longer after the introduction of highly active retroviral therapy. Women are now one of the fastest growing groups with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States and Puerto Rico, but relatively little is known about the prevalence and characteristics of cognitive dysfunction in HIV-infected women. In this study the authors investigated its prevalence in a group of HIV-1-seropositive Hispanic women in Puerto Rico. Forty-nine women with a nadir CD4 cell count of < or = 500 cells/mm3 were enrolled. Cognitive impairment was defined according to the American Academy of Neurology criteria for HIV dementia as modified to identify an ""asymptomatic cognitively impaired"" group. Observed prevalence was compared with prevalence in other populations in United States, Europe, and Australia. Differences in clinical markers and neuropsychological test performance among the cohort stratified by cognitive impairment were tested. Cognitive impairment was observed in 77.6% (38/49) of cases; asymptomatic cognitive impairment in 32.7% (16/49); minor cognitive motor disorders in 16.3% (8/49); and HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in 28.6% (14/49). Cognitive impairment did not correlate with age, CD4 cell count, viral load, or treatment modality. The cross-sectional prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment was 77.6% (28.6% for HAD). These findings should enhance awareness of the prevalence of HIV-associated cognitive impairment, both clinically apparent and ""asymptomatic,"" in Hispanic women and lead to improvements in areas such as education and compliance and to reevaluation of treatment interventions."
8781,0.002,2.0,"Dolutegravir is a preferred antiretroviral drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients following solid organ transplantation. It has potent antiretroviral activity and does not interact with calcineurin inhibitors. We describe a case of an HIV-infected kidney transplant patient, who was noted to have a rising serum creatinine following initiation of dolutegravir. At first, an acute rejection episode was suspected, but this finding was later attributed to inhibition of creatinine secretion by dolutegravir. We suggest that an awareness of this potential effect of dolutegravir is important for providers who take care of HIV-positive kidney transplant recipients, in order to prevent potentially unnecessary testing.

3261,0.002,2.0,"This study assessed prescribing physicians' attitudes toward early initiation of HAART, three months after the dissemination of the first French official treatment guideline. Telephone interviews have been made in a national random sample of physicians with full- or part-time practice in hospital departments delivering care for HIV-infected patients. Questionnaires included hypothetical clinical cases. Logistic regression compared characteristics of respondents according to attitudes toward HAART. Among the 483 respondents (response rate = 87.0%), agreement was high with official recommendations to systematically initiate HAART with protease inhibitors (PIs) for patients with CD4+ cell counts < or = 300/mm3, following a diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection, or for HIV sexual risk post-exposure prophylaxis. Confronted with a case of a naive asymptomatic patient with stable 450 CD4+/mm3, 34.6% would prescribe HAART with PIs in any case, and 29.8% only if the patient has plasma viral load < or = 10,000 HIV RNA copies/ml. The remaining 35.6% would not prescribe PIs and were older, had limited activity in HIV care and expressed more interest in alternative medicines. To avoid a confusing impact of variability of clinical attitudes toward uncertainties associated with antiretroviral treatments among HIV-infected patients, shared decision-making between patient and physician should be promoted for initiation of HAART."
5084,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the Asian American population is disproportionately high compared with the US population as a whole. Effective management is difficult because of cultural barriers, which can be better understood with recognition of the diversity of the Asian continent in terms of language and spiritual beliefs. Barriers to care among the Asian American population include educational deficits, low socioeconomic status, lack of health insurance, noncitizenship, inability to communicate in English, negative perceptions of Western medicine, and underrepresentation among health care professionals. Given the diversity of the population, some subpopulations may be more directly affected by certain barriers than others. The resulting delays in seeking care can lead to poor outcomes and risk of HBV transmission to household members. Health care providers are obligated to educate themselves regarding cultural sensitivity and to advocate for improved access to care."
156,0.002,2.0,"Indications of liver transplantation are extensive, but deceased donation does not meet the demand. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive grafts used to be discarded in the past. The aim of this study was to examine viral activity and outcome of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts transplanted to HBsAg-positive recipients. Eleven HBsAg-positive deceased grafts were transplanted to HBsAg-positive patients with acute liver failure (3 patients), hepatocellular carcinoma (6 patients) and repeatedly bleeding varices (2 patients). Postoperatively, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was treated by a combination of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. HBV DNA and HBsAg were measured periodically. The median (interquartile) model of end-stage liver disease score for the recipients was 19 (16-32) with a range from 11 to 40. HBV DNA was detected in 6 patients with a range from 61 to 1083 IU/mL before transplantation. After transplantation, HBV DNA was detected in 4 patients in the first month and 2 patients in the 6th month and became undetectable for all patients at end of the first year. The quantitative HBsAg ranged from 0.86 to 241.1 IU/mL at 6 months and 0.34 to 238.5 IU/mL at 24 months (P = .135). Three of the patients died in the early phase, and the other patients were followed up for 40.0 ± 19.2 months with normal liver function. In conclusion, HBsAg-positive deceased liver grafts function well with minimal viral activity under treatment of combined antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide analogues. Use of HBsAg-positive deceased grafts is feasible and increases the donor pool to rescue dying patients."
8958,0.002,2.0,"We investigated the frequency of HBsAg clearance and the possible role of viral superinfection in a long-term follow-up of 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Our subjects were 184 patients with chronic hepatitis B and the follow-up was 12-216 months (mean 66.2 +/- 53.7 months). The investigative methods used were: immunoenzymatic assays for HBV, HCV, HDV, and HIV markers; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HBV DNA; and liver biopsy and immunoperoxidase. During the follow-up, 20 of the 184 patients cleared serum HBsAg. A comparison of patients with persistent HBsAg(group I) and of those who cleared this marker (group II) showed a significant difference in mortality (P = 0.002) between the two groups and a tendency to a more severe exacerbation (flare) in group II (P = 0.07). Antibodies to hepatitis C and D virus as well as antibodies to HIV were equally distributed in both groups. Thirteen patients (7.9%) from group I, but none from group II, subsequently developed hepatocellular carcinoma. These results suggest that the frequency of spontaneous clearance of HBsAg during chronic HBV infection is low. No determinant factor for the clearance was found, including the presence of liver cirrhosis. Serum HBV DNA was undetectable by PCR after clearance in 16 out of 17 patients."
325,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy."
6280,0.002,2.0,"Viral hepatitis serological markers were analyzed in two groups of pregnant women residing in Caracas from: 1) a maternity unit at the moment of delivery (106 sera, low income population), and 2) a private clinic during the third trimester of pregnancy (105 sera, medium-high economic class population). A higher percent positivity was observed in the maternity unit compared to the private clinic for hepatitis A virus (HAV) as measured by anti-HAV activity (96% vs 48%; p < 0.01%), for hepatitis B virus (HBV) as measured by anti-HBc activity (13% vs 2%; p < 0.01%), but not for HBV carriage, as measured by HBsAg (3.8% vs 0%; p = 0.06 %). These differences appear to correlate with the socio-economic level. All the HBsAg positive sera were HBeAg negative and negative for the presence of DNA by PCR, confirming the low rate of perinatal transmission observed in Venezuela. Two out of 106 sera (1.9%) were positive for HCV antibodies in the maternity unit and 0/105 in the private clinic, although these differences were non significant (N.S.). Two out of 106 sera (1.9%) were positive for HEV antibodies in the maternity unit and 1/80 (1.3%) in the private clinic (N.S.). The anti-HEV seropositivity probably reflects a past infection. The importance of testing these viral markers during pregnancy is discussed."
3095,0.002,2.0,"Abstract We report the presence of drug resistance mutations in 7.4% (2/27) of the treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected children in Pune, India, who had HIV-1 RNA levels >1,000 copies/ml. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations, namely A98G and K103N, were observed in two separate sequences. In addition, three study sequences displayed three separate HIV-1 protease minor resistance mutations-L10I, A71T, and T74S. These preliminary data from Pune, India, reporting the presence of HIVDR in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected children, reinforces the need to conduct large-scale studies to assess the prevalence of primary HIVDR in the pediatric population, which in turn will aid in planning protocols and policies related to antiretroviral treatment for the pediatric population.

8552,0.002,2.0,"Studies have shown that hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels remain stable over time in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals taking combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), while spontaneous clearance of HCV RNA during the persistent infection phase has been documented only rarely among those with the CC interleukin (IL)-28B genotype. This study describes HCV RNA profiles and factors associated with changes over time in HCV RNA levels in the ESPRIT study."
4933,0.002,2.0,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been reported to restore defects in cell-mediated immunity to a significant degree, little is known of its effects in restoring HIV-induced abnormal antibody-mediated immunity. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1) 29 HIV-infected patients on chronic HAART whose HIV viral load was undetectable and whose absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count had been consistently sustained by > or =150 cells/microL over their pre-HAART nadir value for >1 year; and 2) 29 untreated HIV-infected patients with current CD4 counts matching the treated patients' prior nadir CD4 counts. Serum was tested for total IgG and by protein electrophoresis with immunofixation for paraproteins. Although serum IgG levels were significantly lower in patients who had received long-term virologically effective HAART than in CD4 count-matched untreated patients (1488 +/- 475 mg/dL vs. 1999 +/- 775 mg/dL, p =.004), serum IgG was still abnormally elevated in 45% of the untreated group despite a mean 28 months of HAART-induced HIV suppression and CD4 count restoration. Paraprotein spikes were confirmed by immunofixation in 7% of patients in each group. This study provides the longest reported observation to date of the effect of HAART on HIV-induced abnormal antibody-mediated immunity. Larger and longer-term studies of HAART effect on B-cell reconstitution are needed."
2418,0.002,2.0,"Cyclophilin A (CyPA) is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions via contact with the Gag polyprotein. Genetic or pharmacologic disruption of CyPA incorporation causes a quantitative reduction in virion infectivity with no discernible effects on virion assembly or on endogenous reverse transcriptase activity. Instead, the reduction of virion-associated CyPA is accompanied by a parallel, quantitative decrease in the initiation of viral DNA synthesis after infection of T cells. The infectivity of CyPA-deficient virions is not restored by pseudotyping with Env of amphotropic murine leukemia virus, demonstrating that CyPA is not required for the HIV-1-Env-CD4 interaction. These results indicate that CyPA is required for an early step in the HIV-1 life cycle following receptor binding and membrane fusion but preceding reverse transcription. CyPA is the first cellular protein other than the cell surface receptor shown to be required for an early event in the life cycle of a retrovirus."
8164,0.002,2.0,"DNA polymerase activity was assayed in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and core particles isolated from chronic producer lines. The particle-associated DNA polymerase activity, which was found to be limited to incorporation of only a few nucleotides, was inhibited by the 5'-triphosphates of nucleoside analogs. The 1-beta-L (1S,4R) and 1-beta-D (1R,4S) enantiomers of antiviral nucleoside analogs were compared for the ability to inhibit incorporation of natural nucleoside triphosphates into the viral DNA. Previously, both enantiomers of several analogs were found to be substrates for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (HIV RT); the 1-beta-D enantiomers of some pairs were preferred as substrates. In contrast, the 1-beta-L enantiomers of all pairs tested were the more potent inhibitors of labeled substrate incorporation into hepatitis B virus DNA; the concentration required to inhibit the incorporation of the natural substrate by 50% was 6-fold to several hundred-fold lower than the concentration of the 1-beta-D enantiomer required for the same inhibitory effect. This preference for the 1-beta-L enantiomers was observed for both RNA-directed synthesis in core particles and DNA-directed synthesis in viral particles. The observed antiviral effect of the nucleoside analogs in cell culture seemed to be limited chiefly by their phosphorylation in cells."
9941,0.002,2.0,"Data were collected prospectively from 116 children younger than 2 years old who were seen at the Duke Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Unit for known human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. Forty-six (40%) of these children were human immunodeficiency virus-infected and 70 were not infected. Using 3-month blocks, 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles were calculated for the CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts, percentage of lymphocytes positive for CD4 and CD8 and T4:T8 ratios. Results from the infected and uninfected children were compared. By 3 to 6 months of age the infected patients had significantly lower CD4+ counts, percentage CD4+ cells and T4:T8 ratios, whereas the percentage of CD8+ lymphocytes was significantly higher. Absolute CD8+ counts were approximately the same in infected and uninfected children through age 2 years. Most infected children had one or more abnormal lymphocyte subset results (less than the 10th percentile for uninfected patients) by age 2: 83% had an abnormal CD4+ percentage; 78% had an abnormal T4:T8 ratio; and 67% had an abnormal CD4+ count. All 13 children who had an opportunistic infection (at any age) had an abnormal CD4+ percentage before age 2 years, and 12 of 13 had a low absolute CD4+ count or T4:T8 ratio. Among patients who died 10 of 11 had 1 or more low CD4+ count, 9 of 11 had an abnormal CD4+ percentage and 8 of 11 an abnormal T4/T8 ratio."
423,0.002,2.0,"Seventeen biopsies taken from oral mucosa of HIV infected patients were analysed for the distribution of CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes and Langerhans cells. The results were evaluated statistically. An increase in the absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in HIV infected patients without clinical symptoms, ARC or AIDS was seen in the connective tissue stroma when compared with normal oral mucosa from sero-negative patients. However, the ratio between CD4+/CD8+ cells was decreased due to the disproportionate increase of CD8+ cells. These findings did not show statistical correlation with the clinical status of the infection. In contrast to the increase in absolute number of CD4+/CD8+ cells the number of Langerhans cells was unchanged when compared with the control group. Using four different monoclonal antibodies against virus structural proteins (2 X anti p24, gp41, gp120) two of 26 patients showed labelled cells in consecutive sections in the same connective tissue areas. It was assumed that latently infected mononuclear cells invaded the oral mucosa together with uninfected cells of the cellular immune system."
7528,0.002,2.0,"The aims of the present study were to analyze the impact of perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection on lymphocyte maturation in children, to determine the expression of activation markers on CD8+ cells, and to define predictors of survival in HIV-infected children. Seventy-one children presenting HIV-related symptoms were included in the study; 29 were less than 2 y old and 42 were 2 to 12 y of age. Results were compared with those obtained in normal children of a similar age. In HIV-infected children the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+CD45RA+ cells was significantly decreased, whereas that of CD8+, CD8+CD38+, and CD8+CD45RO+ cells was strikingly increased compared with controls. In children less than 2 y old the absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+CD45RA+ cells decreased, and the number of CD8+CD45RO+ cells increased significantly, whereas the number of CD8+ and CD8+CD38+ cells did not change. The absolute number of CD4+ T cells declined with age both among controls and among HIV-infected children. In contrast, the absolute number of CD8+ cells and CD8 subsets decreased with age only in controls but not in infected children. In HIV-1-infected children the expression of the CD38 and CD45RO markers on CD8+ cells was significantly correlated, indicating that these were activated cells. The survival of less than 2-y-old children with AIDS symptoms was positively correlated with the total number of CD8 cells and CD8+CD38+ cells at time of entry into the study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
7675,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) drug resistance results from the accumulation of mutations in the viral genes targeted by the drugs. These genetic changes, however, are commonly detected and monitored by techniques that only take into account the dominant population of plasma virus. Because HIV-1-infected patients harbor a complex and diverse mixture of virus populations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence and the evolution of resistance are not fully elucidated. Using techniques that allow the quantification of resistance mutations in minority virus species, we have monitored the evolution of resistance in plasma virus populations from patients failing protease inhibitor treatment. Minority populations with distinct resistance genotypes were detected in all patients throughout the evolution of resistance. The emergence of new dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence of a new mutation in a currently dominant genotype and (ii) emergence of a new genotype derived from a minority virus species. In most cases, these population changes were associated with an increase in resistance at the expense of a reduction in replication capacity. Our findings provide a preliminary indication that minority viral species, which evolve independently of the majority virus population, can eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving as a reservoir of diversity and possibly accelerating the development of drug resistance."
4726,0.002,2.0,"The number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is gradually increasing in Japan, and the morbidity rate from tuberculosis in the Japanese people is high. Accordingly, the number of cases with both infections is considered to increase in the future. Our hospital has already encountered 31 cases of HIV associated tuberculosis. HIV infects mainly CD4-positive cells. The extreme decrease in the cell count results in serious cellular immunological disorder. CD4-positive cell disorder induces disorders of B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophage functions. These destructive conditions show the state of immunodeficiency including macrophage that are most important for defense of acid-fast bacterial infection. Migration and activation of macrophages with cytokines derived from T cells are impaired to induce the following phenomena: hypoplasia of granuloma, failure of tubercule bacillus suppression, the spread to regional lymph nodes (hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes), and hematogenous dissemination. On this occasion, caseous necrosis and cavitation are unlikely to occur, and false-negative tuberculin reaction is often observed. The incidence of severe cases, which include miliary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, etc., and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, are high among acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated tuberculosis cases. HIV-infected tuberculosis cases are generally regarded as endogenous exacerbation, but they include primary infection and reinfection as well. Even during the treatment for drug-sensitive strains particularly, some cases may have reinfection with multidrug-resistant bacteria, suggesting that caution should be taken against this point. Conversely, the association of tuberculosis is a factor for the poor prognosis of HIV infection, since it facilitates the development of HIV infection. If the bacteria belong to a drug-sensitive strain, the infection with them responds well to antituberculous drugs, the same as in tuberculosis cases without HIV infection, showing a favorable prognosis. However, the mortality rate of infection with multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis is extremely high. The combined use of a protease inhibitor, i.e., anti-HIV drug, with rifampicin is regarded as contraindication for the treatment because rifampicin strongly induces hepatic cytochrome P-450 and increases the metabolism of protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptases to markedly decrease the blood concentrations. Accordingly, the treatment for tuberculosis should take priority over that for HIV infection in HIV-infected tuberculosis, and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may be administered after the treatment of tuberculosis. When HAART is necessary for the treatment during the tuberculosis treatment, rifampicin had better be exchanged to rifabutin because the effect of rifabutin to induce cytochrome P-450 is less potent than that of rifampicin. A report has recently shown that the exacerbation of pyrexia and chest X-ray findings was transiently observed approximately 2 weeks after potent anti-HIV therapy for HIV-infected tuberculosis, which included a protease inhibitor. The reason for the exacerbation has been believed to be that the impaired function of CD4-positive cells is improved by the administration of anti-HIV drugs to raise temporarily the reaction of the vital part to M. tuberculosis. A tuberculin skin test (TST) reaction size of > or = 5 mm of induration is considered positive (i.e., indicative of M. tuberculosis infection) in persons who are infected with HIV. Persons with a TST reaction size > or = 5 mm who have not previously received treatment for M. tuberculosis infection should receive tuberculosis preventive treatment. Prevention by BCG vaccination is regarded as contraindications for HIV-infected patients, because disseminated M. bovis infection may be associated with them. Many HIV-positive patients infected with tuberculosis show uneventful healing, when M. tuberculosis is the sensitive strain. However, since some patients show the rapid course of tuberculosis, clinical physicians keep the early detection of tuberculosis for HIV-infected patients and the association of HIV infection for tuberculosis patients in their mind, respectively."

Its presence has been associated with poor quality of life, HIV disease progression and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Although antidepressive treatment has demonstrated effectiveness on the management of depressive symptoms, improvement of clinical and laboratory parameters, and enhancement of antiretroviral adherence, depression is frequently under diagnosed and under treated in these patients.

2622,0.002,2.0,"We previously reported that biodegradable amphiphilic poly(gamma-glutamic acid) nanoparticles (NPs) carrying the recombinant gp120 env protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) were efficiently taken up by dendritic cells, and induced strong CD8(+) T cell responses against the gp120 in mice. To evaluate gp120-carrying NPs (gp120-NPs) as a vaccine candidate for HIV-1 infection, we vaccinated rhesus macaques with these gp120-NPs and examined the immune response and protective efficacy against a challenge inoculation of simian and human immunodeficiency chimeric virus (SHIV). We found that gp120-NP vaccination induced stronger responses for both gp120-specific cellular and humoral immunity than gp120-alone vaccination. After the challenge inoculation with SHIV, however, the peak value of viral RNA in the peripheral blood was higher in the vaccinated groups, especially the gp120-NP vaccinated group, than naive control group. Higher value of viral load was also maintained in gp120-NP vaccinated group. Furthermore, CD4(+) T cells from the peripheral blood decreased more in the vaccinated groups than the control group. Thus, induced immune responses against gp120 enclosed in NPs were not effective for protection but, conversely enhanced the infection, although the gp120-NPs showed a stronger induction of immune responses against the vaccinated antigen in rhesus macaques. These results support the importance of determining immune correlate of protective immunity for vaccine development against HIV-1 infection."

8586,0.002,2.0,"We studied the relation between the occurrence of adverse reactions to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prophylaxis and the subsequent course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a cohort of homosexual men. Adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (P < .001) and death (P < .001) and with a more rapid decline in CD4+ cell counts (P = .001). The median time to progression to AIDS was 14.9 months in subjects with adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ and 32.5 months in those without adverse reactions. After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P = .004). A low CD4+ cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2.54 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-4.28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.29-3.81). The relative hazards of adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS with the exclusion of PCP and toxoplasmosis, CD4+ cell counts of <50/mm3, and death were 2.16 (95% CI, 1.25-3.72), 2.37 (95% CI, 1.36-4.12), and 3.21 (95% CI, 1.80-5.72), respectively. It is unclear whether adverse reactions to TMP-SMZ induce or merely predict progression of HIV disease."
3944,0.002,2.0,"In recent years the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals has been based on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) comprising a combination of nucleoside analogues or the combination of these agents with protease inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of oral lesions in a cohort of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART, to compare these data with the prevalence of lesions prior to HAART and to correlate these finding with the immunologic data. A total of 103 HIV-seropositive patients on HAART were selected. Oral lesions associated with HIV infection and immunological parameters were registered. On re-examination 6 months after the first evaluation, 61/103 patients were available. Comparing the prevalence of oral lesions before and after the onset of HAART, the number of oral lesions was significantly lower (P=0.001). The number of CD4+ cells increased and the viral load decreased significantly after initiation of HAART (P=0.001 and P= 0.0001). On re-examination 6 months later, the prevalence of lesions again decreased significantly (P=0.001). The immunological benefits of HAART may prevent HIV-associated oral lesions in patients with advanced HIV disease. Our results showed that oral manifestations decrease on HAART, but in four patients the immunological effects of therapy did not provide sufficient protection against human papillomavirus (HPV)induced lesions."
7632,0.002,2.0,"The hypothesis that quiescent CD4+ T lymphocytes carrying proviral DNA provide a reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was examined. In a study of 22 patients successfully treated with HAART for up to 30 months, replication-competent virus was routinely recovered from resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. The frequency of resting CD4+ T cells harboring latent HIV-1 was low, 0.2 to 16.4 per 10(6) cells, and, in cross-sectional analysis, did not decrease with increasing time on therapy. The recovered viruses generally did not show mutations associated with resistance to the relevant antiretroviral drugs. This reservoir of nonevolving latent virus in resting CD4+ T cells should be considered in deciding whether to terminate treatment in patients who respond to HAART."
4989,0.002,2.0,"The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) is a leading target in current antiretroviral therapy. Unfortunately, drug-resistant RT mutants evolve under the pressure of these drugs, and therefore, new anti-RT inhibitors are constantly required for HIV-1/AIDS treatment. We virtually screened a large chemical library of compounds against two crystal structures of HIV-1 RT to identify novel inhibitors. Top-scoring compounds were tested experimentally; 71 inhibited the RT-associated DNA polymerase, while several also inhibited HIV-1 pseudovirus infection in a cell-based assay. A combination of substituents from two structurally related inhibitors in a single molecule improved the inhibition efficacy. This compound strongly suppressed the RT-associated activity also protecting human lymphocytes from HIV-1 infection. RT inhibition by this compound was reversible and noncompetitive. This molecule and another structurally unrelated potent compound inhibited a known drug-resistant mutant of HIV-1 RT and affected moderately the HIV-2 RT-associated DNA polymerase. These inhibitors may serve as promising anti-HIV lead compounds."
9064,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1 envelope-specific CD4+ T cell lines were established simultaneously from PBMC and lymph node mononuclear cells of two HIV-1-infected patients. Three recombinant envelope proteins were used to establish the CD4+ T cell lines: gp160NL4-3, gp120IIIB, and gp120MN. Six T cell lines were established from the first patient, one for each Ag from each compartment, and four T cell lines, two per compartment, were established from the second patient. Each line was challenged with a panel of overlapping peptides spanning the entire gp120 sequence to define its T cell epitope specificity. The pattern of recognition for all the lines from any given patient was similar between compartments. Each patient had a different pattern of peptide recognition. TCR analysis showed a heterogeneous usage of Vbeta between lines with same peptide specificity and established from different compartments. These data suggest that the cellular immune response does not phenotypically vary between the peripheral blood and lymph node compartments, but demonstrates genotypic heterogeneity, showing possible redundancy of the immune response to HIV-1 gp160."
3010,0.002,2.0,"Patients coinfected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied with regard to nucleotide sequence variability in the E2/NS1 first hypervariable region of the HCV genome. The nucleotide variability within individual patients was compared to patients infected only with HCV. The proportion of predicted synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and the relationship to putative high-antigenicity sites, were evaluated in the hypervariable envelope domain. Ninety-one clones from 10 patients with HCV/HIV coinfection were sequenced, following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the hypervariable region. The control HCV group included 53 clones from 7 patients. Sequence analysis encompassed the region coding for amino acids 384 to 414. Consensus sequences from each patient were used as the internal standard for nonsynonymous amino acid codon variability. Cumulative proportional comparison at each amino acid site revealed increased variability in HCV RNA from patients with HCV/HIV coinfection versus HCV alone (P < .05). The greatest variability was observed at amino acids 386, 397, 400, 402, 405, 407, and 414, with >l0 percent clonal variation at these sites. Jameson-Wolf plots were used to predict putative high-antigenicity domains. Nonsynonymous clonal variation resulted in alteration of putative antigenic sites within the hypervariable region. All clones had at least one high-probability site. Clones with unique predicted antigenic domains were observed more frequently in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, and, independent of viral titer, were consistent with increased sequence variability. These data suggest an accumulation of envelope variants in the HCV/HIV coinfected patients, which could be related to ineffective viral clearance, and may help explain prior reports of interferon (IFN) resistance in this patient group."
5732,0.002,2.0,"Vicriviroc (VCV) is a small-molecule CCR5 coreceptor antagonist currently in clinical trials for treatment of R5-tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. With this drug in development, identification of resistance mechanisms to VCV is needed to allow optimal outcomes in clinical practice. In this study we further characterized VCV resistance in a lab-adapted, VCV-resistant RU570 virus (RU570-VCV(res)). We show that K305R, R315Q, and K319T amino acid changes in the V3 loop, along with P437S in C4, completely reproduced the resistance phenotype in a chimeric ADA envelope containing the C2-V5 region from RU570 passage control gp120. The K305R amino acid change primarily impacted the degree of resistance, whereas K319T contributed to both resistance and virus infectivity. The P437S mutation in C4 had more influence on the relative degree of virus infectivity, while the R315Q mutation contributed to the virus concentration-dependent phenotypic resistance pattern observed for RU570-VCV(res). RU570-VCV(res) pseudovirus entry with VCV-bound CCR5 was dramatically reduced by Y10A, D11A, Y14A, and Y15A mutations in the N terminus of CCR5, whereas these mutations had less impact on entry in the absence of VCV. Notably, an additional Q315E/I317F substitution in the crown region of the V3 loop enhanced resistance to VCV, resulting in a stronger dependence on the N terminus for viral entry. By fitting the envelope mutations to a molecular model of a recently described docked N-terminal CCR5 peptide consisting of residues 2 to 15 in complex with HIV-1 gp120 CD4, potential new interactions in gp120 with the N terminus of CCR5 were uncovered. The cumulative results of this study suggest that as the RU570 VCV-resistant virus adapted to use the drug-bound receptor, it also developed an increased reliance on the N terminus of CCR5."
7119,0.002,2.0,"The virus population transmitted by a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected individual undergoes restriction and subsequent diversification in the new host. However, in contrast to men, who have limited virus diversity at seroconversion, there is measurable diversity in viral envelope gene sequences in women infected with clade A HIV-1. In this study, virus sequence diversity in three unrelated, clade A infected women preceding and shortly after seroconversion was evaluated. It was demonstrated that there is measurable evolution of envelope gene sequences over this time interval. Furthermore, in each of the three individuals, amino acid substitutions arose at five or six positions in sequences derived at or shortly after seroconversion relative to sequences obtained from the seronegative sample. Presented here is a model of clade A gp120 to determine the location of substitutions that appeared as the virus population became established in three clade A HIV-1 infected women."
1714,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains display a high degree of heterogeneity in their biological properties that correlate with in vivo pathogenesis of the virus. We previously demonstrated that overlapping regions encompassing the third hypervariable domain (V3), within the envelope glycoprotein gp120 determine the tropisms of HIV-1 for T-cell lines and primary macrophages. Studies with mutant viruses carrying one or more amino acid substitutions in the V3 loop have now identified this hypervariable domain as a major determinant for these cellular host range properties. Three to five amino acid changes in this domain, but rarely a single amino acid substitution, can confer macrophage tropism and alter T-cell-line tropism. These findings emphasize the effect on cell tropism of small amino acid differences in the viral envelope and suggest that the overall conformation of the V3 loop plays the major role in determining the ability of HIV-1 to infect T-cell lines and primary macrophages."
4663,0.002,2.0,"Most studies of the medical costs of HIV infection focus on the terminal stage of this chronic illness when the patients have developed AIDS or severe HIV disease and in-patient care dominates. Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs. There is a need for more studies in different settings to assess the impact of HIV infection on outpatient care in developing countries."
6530,0.002,2.0,"To evaluate the possible role of parasitemia on Chagas' disease reactivation in Chagas' disease/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection cases and the impact of HIV coinfection on Trypanosoma cruzi genetic diversity, 71 patients with Chagas' disease (34 HIV+ and 37 HIV-) were surveyed. Moreover, 92 T. cruzi stocks from 47 chronic chagasic patients (29 HIV+ and 18 HIV-) were isolated and analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and a random amplified polymorphic DNA procedure. High parasitemia appeared to play a major role in cases of Chagas' disease reactivation. In HIV+ patients, the genetic diversity and population structure (clonality) of T. cruzi was similar to that previously observed in HIV- patients, which indicates that immunodepression does not modify drastically genotype repartition of the parasite. There was no apparent association between given T. cruzi genotypes and specific clinical forms of Chagas' disease/HIV associations."
3885,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef downregulates major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), impairing the clearance of infected cells by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). While sequence motifs mediating this function have been determined by in vitro mutagenesis studies of laboratory-adapted HIV-1 molecular clones, it is unclear whether the highly variable Nef sequences of primary isolates in vivo rely on the same sequence motifs. To address this issue, nef quasispecies from nine chronically HIV-1-infected persons were examined for sequence evolution and altered MHC-I downregulatory function under Gag-specific CTL immune pressure in vitro. This selection resulted in decreased nef diversity and strong purifying selection. Site-by-site analysis identified 13 codons undergoing purifying selection and 1 undergoing positive selection. Of the former, only 6 have been reported to have roles in Nef function, including 4 associated with MHC-I downregulation. Functional testing of naturally occurring in vivo polymorphisms at the 7 sites with no previously known functional role revealed 3 mutations (A84D, Y135F, and G140R) that ablated MHC-I downregulation and 3 (N52A, S169I, and V180E) that partially impaired MHC-I downregulation. Globally, the CTL pressure in vitro selected functional Nef from the in vivo quasispecies mixtures that predominately lacked MHC-I downregulatory function at the baseline. Overall, these data demonstrate that CTL pressure exerts a strong purifying selective pressure for MHC-I downregulation and identifies novel functional motifs present in Nef sequences in vivo."
1983,0.002,2.0,"In Poland, as in many other countries, HIV infection is often detected at a late stage. We conducted this study to determine if Polish medical students possess adequate HIV/AIDS knowledge and diagnostic skills needed to improve HIV detection and care in Poland. Between 2004 and 2006, sixth-year (senior) medical students at the Medical University of Bialystok were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire with questions about HIV transmission route and clinical characteristics. Although more than 50% of student respondents estimated their knowledge of HIV/AIDS as good or very good, HIV/AIDS knowledge assessment results did not support this self-reported level of proficiency. More than 40% of students answered that there are no symptoms associated with HIV infection that would make primary care physicians suspect the diagnosis. A significant majority of students could not name AIDS indicator diseases. To improve public health and quality of care for persons infected with HIV, it is necessary to better educate physicians-in-training about the clinical characteristics and transmission routes for HIV/AIDS, as well as approaches to discuss human sexuality and sexually transmitted infection prevention with patients."
2651,0.002,2.0,"Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus are predisposed to develop a variety of common and uncommon infectious and neoplastic pulmonary diseases. Clinical information that can stratify the risk of occurrence of these pulmonary conditions includes: 1) CD4 cell count-the most important determinant; 2) concurrent antimicrobial therapy; 3) prior travel history; 4) known latent infections that may reactivate: and 5) underlying respiratory disease. Specific pulmonary diseases are discussed including: bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis, mycobacterial and fungal infections, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and lung cancer. A differential diagnosis can be generated based on the chest radiographic pattern. Focal or multifocal areas of consolidation usually represent conventional bacterial pneumonia or, less commonly, tuberculosis. In severely immunocompromised patients, unusual diseases causing consolidation should be considered including: Rhodococcus infection, nocardiosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, and lymphoma. Nodules can be present in tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and Kaposi sarcoma. Interstitial opacities are common in pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, histoplasmosis, and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Cavitation and cysts are features of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, tuberculosis, aspergillosis, and lung cancer. Disease of the airways is increasingly recognized in those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Lymphadenopathy is most common in mycobacterial infection, but can be a feature of fungal infection, lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and lung cancer. The combined use of clinical information, knowledge of typical conditions associated with the human immunodeficiency syndrome, and radiographic patterns offers a useful approach to the diagnosis of pulmonary disease in the patient with the human immunodeficiency virus."
4988,0.002,2.0,"Primary HIV-1 infection induces a virus-specific adaptive/cytolytic immune response that impacts the plasma viral load set point and the rate of progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) suppresses plasma viremia to undetectable levels that rebound upon cART treatment interruption. Following cART withdrawal, the memory component of the virus-specific adaptive immune response may improve viral control compared to primary infection. Here, using primary infection and treatment interruption data from macaques infected with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV), we observe a lower peak viral load but an unchanged viral set point during viral rebound. The addition of an autologous stem cell transplant before cART withdrawal alters viral dynamics: we found a higher rebound set point but similar peak viral loads compared to the primary infection. Mathematical modeling of the data that accounts for fundamental immune parameters achieves excellent fit to heterogeneous viral loads. Analysis of model output suggests that the rapid memory immune response following treatment interruption does not ultimately lead to better viral containment. Transplantation decreases the durability of the adaptive immune response following cART withdrawal and viral rebound. Our model's results highlight the impact of the endogenous adaptive immune response during primary SHIV infection. Moreover, because we capture adaptive immune memory and the impact of transplantation, this model will provide insight into further studies of cure strategies inspired by the Berlin patient."
1202,0.002,2.0,"Nutritional support of patients with HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has many similarities to other disease states in that the same nutritional products and techniques are used. Some patients with HIV, and many with AIDS without secondary infection, experience a metabolic milieu similar to patients with cancer cachexia. In providing dietary counselling to the HIV patient, we encounter many of the obstacles that must be overcome to improve nutrition in cancer: anorexia, gastrointestinal discomfort, lethargy, and poor nutrient utilization, which limit the ability for nutritional repletion. When a secondary infection is superimposed on HIV, patients resemble more highly catabolic trauma patients or patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), where, despite aggressive efforts to feed, there is usually a net nitrogen wasting leading to the more rapid development of cachexia. However, even in this setting, feeding will limit substantially net catabolism when compared to total starvation. Because the nutritional needs of HIV patients vary greatly, individual strategies have to be designed as the patient moves through the stages of disease. Patients are generally able to consume adequate nutrition either as regular food or dietary supplements during the latency period of viral replication. Once secondary infections become prevalent, artificial diets administered by tube or by vein may be required during the period of active secondary infections, with dietary supplements often helpful during more quiescent periods. Patients with HIV are among the most challenging for clinicians providing nutritional support. Knowledge from treatment of patients with other diseases may be useful, but more data must be gathered on the unique aspects of aetiology and treatment of the anorexia, malabsorption, and ultimate wasting associated with AIDS."

Opioid agonist treatment (ie, methadone or buprenorphine) is effective and decreases HIV transmission risk behaviors and HIV seroconversion. Despite prevention efforts, injection drug use (IDU) and risky sexual behaviors remain prevalent in patients receiving opioid agonist treatment.

1115,0.002,2.0,"Integration, an indispensable step for retrovirus replication, is executed by integrase (IN), which is expressed as a part of a Gag-Pol precursor. Although mechanistic detail of the IN-catalyzed integration reaction is well defined, numerous evidence have demonstrated that IN is involved in multiple steps of retrovirus replication other than integration. In this study, Huwe1, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, was identified as a new cellular interactor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN. The interaction was mediated through the catalytic core domain of IN and a wide-range region of Huwe1. Interestingly, although depletion of Huwe1 in target cells did not affect the early phase of HIV-1 infection in a human T cell line, we found that infectivity of HIV-1 released from the Huwe1 knockdown cells was significantly augmented more than that of virus produced from control cells. The increase in infectivity occurred in proviral DNA synthesis. Further analysis revealed that Huwe1 interacted with HIV-1 Gag-Pol precursor protein through an IN domain. Our results suggest that Huwe1 in HIV-1 producer cells has a negative impact on early post-entry events during the next round of virus infection via association with an IN region of Gag-Pol."

1422,0.002,2.0,"The long terminal repeat (LTR) of a retrovirus contains sequence elements that constitute a promoter for controlling viral gene expression in infected cells. We have examined regulation of LTR-directed gene expression in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a T-lymphocytopathic lentivirus associated with a fatal AIDS-like disease in domestic cats. Two independent virus isolates, designated FIV-Petaluma and FIV-PPR, have been molecularly cloned and show greater than 85% sequence homology. Both clones (termed pF34 and pPPR) produce infectious virus after transfection of permissive feline cells. Basal promoter activity of the LTRs was measured in various cell lines in transient expression assays using plasmids containing the viral LTR linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Both LTRs were strong promoters in several cell lines, although in some cell lines the pF34 LTR had four- to fivefold higher basal activity than the pPPR LTR. FIV LTR mutations affecting the first AP4 site, AP1 site, ATF site, or NF-kappa B site resulted in decreased basal activity of the FIV promoter. Mutational analysis also revealed a negative regulatory element. In cotransfection experiments, both pF34 proviral DNA and pPPR proviral DNA appeared to transactivate either the pF34 LTR or the pPPR LTR; however, levels of transactivation were very low. Cotransfection of both LTRs with FIV subgenomic clones containing various viral open reading frames resulted in low level or no transactivation. The LTRs of both FIV clones responded to cell activation signals in human T-lymphoid cells (Jurkat) treated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. Promoter function of both FIV LTRs was also enhanced in cells treated with either forskolin, an inducer of intracellular cyclic-AMP (c-AMP), or dibutyryl c-AMP. Analysis of site-specific mutants showed that a potential AP1 site in the U3 domain of the LTR was required for T-cell activation responses mediated by protein kinase C, whereas a putative ATF site was the target for c-AMP-induced responses mediated by protein kinase A. These studies revealed that cellular transcription factors play a significant role in regulation of FIV gene expression."
5182,0.002,2.0,"The persistence of latent reservoirs of HIV-1 represents a major barrier to virus eradication in patients treated with antiretrovirals. Prostratin is a non-tumor promoting 12-deoxyphorbol monoester capable of up-regulating viral expression from latent provirus and therefore is potentially useful for HIV adjuvant therapy and similar properties might be elicited by related non-tumor promoting phorboids. We have therefore investigated a series of phorbol 13-monoesters for their capacity to reactivate HIV latency. Using a Jurkat T cell line containing latent HIV proviruses, we found that prostratin and phorbol-13-stearate effectively activate HIV-1 gene expression in these latently infected cells, with phorbol-13-stearate being at least 10-fold more potent than prostratin, and its activity rapidly decreasing with a shortening of the acyl side chain. We further demonstrated that phorbol-13-stearate and prostratin stimulate IKK-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, leading to activation of NF-kappaB. Moreover, prostratin, phorbol-13-hexanoate and phorbol-13-stearate also activate the JNK and ERK pathways. Studies with isoform-specific PKC inhibitors suggest that the classical PKCs play a prominent role in the responses elicited by phorbol-13-stearate. Nevertheless, this compound induces a translocation pattern of the PKC isotypes alpha and delta to cellular compartments distinctly different from that elicited by prostratin and PMA."

We measured activities of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein in 28 patients before and during ART using a cocktail phenotyping approach. Activities, demographics, and genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein were tested as covariates. Oral midazolam clearance (overall CYP3A activity) decreased to 0.19-fold (90% confidence interval (CI), 0.15-0.23), hepatic midazolam clearance and intestinal midazolam availability changed to 0.24-fold (0.20-0.29) and 1.12-fold (1.00-1.26), respectively. In CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, the plasma ratio AUC(dextromethorphan)/AUC(dextrorphan) increased to 2.92-fold (2.31-3.69). Digoxin area under the curve (AUC)(0-12) (P-glycoprotein activity) increased to 1.81-fold (1.56-2.09). Covariates had no major influence on lopinavir and ritonavir pharmacokinetics. In conclusion, CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein are profoundly inhibited in patients receiving ritonavir boosted lopinavir. The covariates investigated are not useful for a priori dose selection."

5342,0.002,2.0,"The routine determination of drug resistance in newly HIV-1 infected individuals records a potential increase in transmissions of drug-resistant variants. Plasma samples from 38 individuals classified as newly infected (seroconversion time <12 months) and twenty four individuals with an established infection (seroconversion time ranging from 3 to 10 years) were analyzed for the presence of mutations by Trugene HIV-1 genotyping assay and Virtual phenotype. Results on the newly infected and the chronically infected individuals showed a limited number of relevant mutations associated with substantial resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. In particular, three patients (4.8%) carried viral major mutations (T69D and M41L) associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, whereas only one showed the presence of M46L, which is correlated with partial resistance to some protease inhibitors. The clinical interpretation based on different approaches to monitor resistance showed that the Virconet interpretation was less grave than Trugene, suggesting that these interpretations need standardization for the currently used sequencing methods and that they may be associated with different outcomes when eventually are used."

9655,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a potent transcriptional activator of the HIV-1 promoter and also has the ability to modulate a number of cellular regulatory circuits including apoptosis. Tat exerts its effects through interaction with viral as well as cellular proteins. Here, we studied the influence of p73, a protein that is implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle control, on Tat functions in the central nervous system. Protein interaction studies using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the association of Tat with p73. Tat bound to the N-terminal region of p73 spanning amino acids 1 to 120, and this interaction required the cysteine-rich domain (amino acids 30 to 40) of Tat. Association of p73 with Tat prevented the acetylation of Tat on lysine 28 by PCAF. Functional studies including RNA interference showed that p73 inhibited Tat stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter. Furthermore, p73 prevented the interaction of Tat with cyclin T1 in vitro but not in vivo. These findings suggest possible new therapeutic approaches, using p73, for Tat-mediated AIDS pathogenesis."

Nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM 7) was used to develop the population model and explore the influence of covariates on TFV. A sequential analysis approach was utilized. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption best described TFV PK (FOCEI). An indirect stimulation of response model best described TFV-DP, where formation of TFV-DP was driven by plasma TFV concentration. Final plasma population estimates were as follows: absorption rate constant, 1.03 h(-1); apparent clearance (CL/F), 42 liters/h (33.5% interindividual variability [IIV]); intercompartment clearance, 181 liters/h; apparent central distribution volume (Vc/F), 273 liters (64.8% IIV); and apparent peripheral distribution volume (Vp/F), 440 liters (46.5% IIV). Creatinine clearance was the most significant covariate on CL/F and Vc/F. The correlation between CL/F and Vc/F was 0.553. The indirect response model for TFV-DP resulted in estimates of the maximal intracellular concentration (E(max)), the TFV concentration producing 50% of E(max) (EC(50)), and the intracellular elimination rate constant (k(out)) of 300 fmol/10(6) cells (82% IIV), 100 ng/ml (106% IIV), and 0.008 h(-1), respectively. The estimated k(out) gave an 87-h TFV-DP half-life. A predictive check assessment indicated satisfactory model performance. This model links formation of TFV-DP with plasma TFV concentrations and should facilitate more informed investigations of TFV clinical pharmacology."
9896,0.002,2.0,"Lymph nodes are the major site of cell-to-cell transmission and replication of HIV-1. Trafficking of CD4+ T lymphocytes into lymph nodes provides a continual supply of susceptible target lymphocytes, and conversely, recruitment of CD8+ T lymphocytes may be critical for the host response that attempts to control HIV-1 replication. The present study was undertaken as no detailed assessment of lymphocyte subpopulations in HIV-1-infected lymph nodes has previously been reported. Peripheral blood and single-cell suspensions prepared from lymph nodes of patients with HIV-1 and control subjects were analysed using three-colour flow cytometry. Approximately 80% of the lymphocytes in control lymph nodes were CD3+ T lymphocytes, of which over 65% were CD4+. The majority of the CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes obtained from both lymph nodes and blood of control subjects were immunologically naive (CD45RA+). By contrast, in HIV-1-infected patients there was a significant reduction in the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and an expansion of the CD8+ T lymphocyte subset in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Furthermore, a high proportion of these T lymphocytes displayed a marker for immunological memory (CD45RO+). T lymphocytes derived from HIV-1-infected lymph nodes also showed altered expression of the adhesion molecules, L-selectin and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), but not leucocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). In an in vitro adhesion assay, lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected nodes were significantly more adhesive than control lymphocytes on fibronectin, as well as recombinant human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) substrates. This combination of altered lymphocyte subpopulations in the HIV-1-infected lymph nodes, as well as enhanced adhesion phenotype and function, suggests that T lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes in HIV disease may be an important determinant of pathogenesis."
8989,0.002,2.0,"Distal leg epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD) is a validated predictor of HIV sensory neuropathy (SN) risk. We assessed how ENFD is impacted by initiation of first-time antiretroviral therapy (ART) in subjects free of neuropathy and how it is altered when mitochondrial toxic nucleoside medications are used as part of ART. Serial changes in proximal thigh and distal leg ENFD were examined over 72 weeks in 150 Thai subjects randomized to a regimen of stavudine (d4T) switching to zidovudine (ZDV) at 24 weeks vs ZDV vs tenofovir (TDF) for the entire duration of study, all given in combination with nevirapine. We found individual variations in ENFD change, with almost equal number of subjects who decreased or increased their distal leg ENFD over 72 weeks and no relationship to nucleoside backbone or to development of neuropathic signs or symptoms. Lower baseline distal leg ENFD and greater increases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex I (CI) activity were associated with larger increases in distal leg ENFD over 72 weeks. Distal leg ENFD correlated with body composition parameters (body surface area, body mass index, height) as well as with blood pressure measurements. Assessed together with a companion cross-sectional study, we found that mean distal leg ENFD in all HIV+ subjects was lower than in HIV- subjects but similar among HIV+ groups whether ART-naïve or on d4T with/without neuropathy/neuropathic symptoms. The utility of ENFD as a useful predictor of small unmyelinated nerve fiber damage and neuropathy risk in HIV may be limited in certain populations."

8821,0.002,2.0,"Estimates of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prevalence varies among different studies depending on the prevalence of HBV infection in the study population and on the sensitivity of the assay used to detect HBV DNA. We investigated the prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation in a Brazilian referral center. Frozen liver samples from 68 adults were analyzed using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for HBV DNA. The specificity of the amplified HBV sequences was confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicons. The patient population comprised 49 (72.1%) males and 19 (27.9%) females with a median age of 53 years (range=18-67 years). Occult HBV infection was diagnosed in three (4.4%) patients. The etiologies of the underlying chronic liver disease in these cases were alcohol abuse, HBV infection, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Two of the patients with cryptic HBV infection also presented hepatocellular carcinoma. Markers of previous HBV infection were available in two patients with occult HBV infection and were negative in both. In conclusion, using a sensitive nested polymerase chain reaction assay to detect HBV DNA in frozen liver tissue, we found a low prevalence of occult HBV infection in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplant, probably due to the low prevalence of HBV infection in our population.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors related to unmet medical needs. Among the 775 subjects included in the study, 15.4% had perceived unmet medical needs. Significant factors included age group (35-49 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.06), lower monthly income (aOR, 3.75 for the <$900/mo group and 2.44 for the $900-$1800/mo group; 95% CI, 1.68-8.35 and 1.18-5.04, respectively), beneficiaries of the National Medical Aid Program (aOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.01-3.17), recent CD4 cell counts <500/µL (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.33). Taken together, these data reveal strong associations of middle age and low socioeconomic status with perceived unmet medical needs among HIV-infected adults."
9131,0.002,2.0,"Many studies have investigated risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; however, most have failed to show differences in risk factors between suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population. This study was designed to identify differences in risk factors between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among HIV-infected adults in Seoul. A face-to-face survey of 457 HIV-infected adults was conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in 2013. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Among 422 participants, 44% had suicidal ideation, and 11% had suicide attempts. The independent risk factors for suicidal ideation were young and middle age, living with someone, history of AIDS-defining opportunistic disease, history of treatment for depression, lower social support, and psychological status. Beneficiaries of National Medical Aid, economic barriers to treatment, history of treatment for depression, and lower psychological status were independently associated with suicide attempts. Patients with HIV in Korea were treated without cost in some centers. Thus, experiencing an economic barrier to treatment might be due in part to ignorance of HIV care policies. Our findings indicate that suicide attempts are associated with socioeconomic factors and information inequality regarding medical care. In conclusion, suicidal ideation closely associated with the psychosocial factors, whereas suicide attempt demonstrates a stronger association with socioeconomic factors. Suicide prevention measures should be implemented to provide information to help HIV-infected patients. "
8101,0.002,2.0,"We performed a quantitative study of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers, including new parameters such as pre-S1 antigen (Ag), pre-S2 Ag, and anti-HBx, in 88 chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers. New IMx assays for HBsAg and immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-HBc detection were also used. The population studied was composed of 65 chronic hepatitis cases (40 positive for hepatitis B antigen [HBeAg] and 25 positive for anti-HBe) and 23 anti-HBe-positive, asymptomatic HBsAg carriers. Serum HBsAg levels detected by IMx were higher in HBeAg-positive than in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers (all patient subgroups included) and correlated with the serum HBV DNA level (P = 0.0001). Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ags were detected by enzyme immunoassays in almost all HBsAg carriers. Both pre-S1 and pre-S2 Ag titers correlated positively with the serum HBsAg concentration (P = 0.0001), but only the pre-S1 Ag titer correlated with the level of serum HBV DNA (P = 0.02). The detection of low levels of IgM anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc) antibodies by IMx was associated with the presence of liver disease (P = 0.05) but not with the level of viral replication. The prevalence of anti-HBx antibodies detected by the enzyme immunoassay was slightly, although not significantly, higher in patients with high levels of HBV DNA (greater than 100 pg/ml) than in patients without detectable HBV DNA (P = 0.16). In anti-HBe-positive chronic HBsAg carriers, the quantitative detection of serum HBV DNA, pre-S Ag titers, and IgM anti HBc allowed us to predict which patients suffered from chronic liver disease and/or supported viral replication (P < 0.05). In a follow-up study of eight patients undergoing antiviral therapy, the clearance of both pre-S1 Ag and HBV DNA was associated with a subsequent clearance of HBV. Therefore, the quantitative determination of HBV DNA, pre-S Ags, IgM anti-HBc may prove useful for the decision to use and the monitoring of antiviral therapy, especially in anti-HBe-positive HBsAg carriers."
1706,0.002,2.0,"We have characterized the hepatitis B virus state in liver and serum of 38 HBsAg-positive chronic hepatitis patients (chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 19; chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), 7; cirrhosis, 11; 'normal' carrier, 1) and 21 HBsAg-negative patients. Episomal HBV-DNA in liver, without detectable integrated HBV-DNA sequences, concomitant with HBV-DNA in serum was found in 19 HBeAg-positive patients (CAH, 16; CPH, 1; cirrhosis, 2). Integrated sequences were detected in 13 HBsAg-positive HBeAg-negative patients (CAH, 1; CPH, 5; cirrhosis, 7) and in 1 HBsAg-negative patient. Episomal HBV-DNA and integrated HBV-DNA sequences were observed simultaneously in 1 HBsAg-positive HBeAg-negative CPH patient and in 4 HBsAg-positive cirrhosis patients (2 HBeAg-positive, 2 HBeAg-negative). The presence of HBcAg immunofluorescence corresponded well with that of episomal HBV-DNA. Antiviral therapy is advised for HBsAg-positive chronic hepatitis patients with episomal HBV-DNA, irrespective of the presence of integrated sequences. Since the presence of episomal HBV-DNA in liver is not always accompanied by the presence of serum HBV-DNA, procedures for the selection and evaluation of patients for antiviral therapy should be extended by characterization of the HBV-DNA state in liver biopsies."
3083,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is responsible for viral persistence. This study aimed to investigate the serum surrogate markers for cccDNA and to evaluate the intrahepatic viral events associated with disease activity in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Thirty-three treatment-naïve patients with a negative HBeAg who had a liver biopsy were studied. Active disease was defined as a serum alanine aminotransferase >40 IU/L and a serum HBV DNA >10,000 copies/ml. This study showed significant correlation between serum HBV DNA and both log cccDNA (r = 0.41, P = 0.018) and log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (r = 0.71, P < 0.0001). No significant correlation was observed between serum HBsAg and log cccDNA (P = 0.15) or log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (P = 0.97). Fourteen and 19 patients had inactive and active disease, respectively. The median log cccDNA and log total intrahepatic HBV DNA (copies/10(6) cells) were significantly higher in patients with active disease compared with those with inactive disease (4.11 vs. 3.53, P = 0.03 and 5.46 vs. 4.64, P < 0.001, respectively). The HBV replicative efficiency, defined as the ratio of serum HBV DNA to cccDNA, was approximately 20% higher in patients with active disease. No significant difference was observed in the HBsAg levels and the ratio of serum HBsAg to cccDNA between the two groups. In conclusion, serum HBV DNA, but not HBsAg, reflects the amount of cccDNA and the replication efficiency of HBV in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B."
6567,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been used for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Recently, HBV detection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be a direct measure of complete virions and to be potentially a very sensitive method. Therefore, we attempted to analyze the relationship between HBsAg detection and HBV DNA assay by PCR. We tested HBV DNA by a modification of the PCR technique in serial sera from five chimpanzees experimentally infected with HBV and 29 human sera. Our new method of PCR analysis is as sensitive as former methods but is more simple and rapid than existing procedures. In chimpanzee studies, HBV DNA was detected 2-3 weeks before the appearance of HBsAg, and continued to be detectable 2 weeks after the production of antibody to HBsAg. Also, 3 of 11 chronic hepatitis B patients who lost HBsAg were positive for HBV DNA in serum, while all of patients who recovered from acute viral infection were negative for HBV DNA in serum. These results indicate that HBV DNA detection by PCR analysis is the most sensitive method currently available to detect the presence of complete virions in serum."
4418,0.002,2.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has greatly reduced the risk of early death from opportunistic infections and extended the lifespan of people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Thus, many complications and organic damage in the HIV-infected population emerge. Cardiovascular disease as coronary artery disease has become a matter of particular concern. Its incidence is greatly increased in the HIV-infected population over that of people of the same age in the absence of general cardiovascular risk factors. Despite several clinical and laboratory studies in the association between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, the pathogenic mechanisms of this significant clinical problem are largely unknown and are now under active investigation. Endothelial dysfunction is possibly the most plausible link between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. Increased expression of adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and endothelial adhesion molecule (E-selectin) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL-6 has been reported in HIV-positive patients. The effect of HAART on endothelial function in HIV-positive patients is also demonstrated. In this review, we focus on the recent research update of HIV-associated vascular disease and vascular injury. We analyze and discuss the recent clinical and laboratory investigations on the effect of HIV, viral protein, and HAART therapy on endothelial injury and vascular disease; identify the areas of controversy and clinical relevance; and suggest some directions for future research."
5945,0.002,2.0,"Antiretroviral treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type-1 (HIV-1) infections with CCR5-antagonists requires the co-receptor usage prediction of viral strains. Currently available tools are mostly designed based on subtype B strains and thus are in general not applicable to non-B subtypes. However, HIV-1 infections caused by subtype B only account for approximately 11% of infections worldwide. We evaluated the performance of several sequence-based algorithms for co-receptor usage prediction employed on subtype A V3 sequences including circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and subtype C strains. We further analysed sequence profiles of gp120 regions of subtype A, B and C to explore functional relationships to entry phenotypes. Our analyses clearly demonstrate that state-of-the-art algorithms are not useful for predicting co-receptor tropism of subtype A and its CRFs. Sequence profile analysis of gp120 revealed molecular variability in subtype A viruses. Especially, the V2 loop region could be associated with co-receptor tropism, which might indicate a unique pattern that determines co-receptor tropism in subtype A strains compared to subtype B and C strains. Thus, our study demonstrates that there is a need for the development of novel algorithms facilitating tropism prediction of HIV-1 subtype A to improve effective antiretroviral treatment in patients."
1194,0.002,2.0,"Lymphoproliferative responses (LPRs) to recall antigens (Ags) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag and frequencies of circulating HIV-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTLps) were measured in 12 patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) after long-standing HIV-1 infection. LPRs to at least 1 recall Ag became detectable or increased in all patients during HAART. No significant LPRs to Gag-p24 were observed, whereas 4 of 8 patients tested presented with Gag-p17-specific LPRs. HIV-1-specific CTLp frequencies became measurable or increased early during therapy in 6 of 10 patients tested and were maintained or decreased thereafter. Increasing HIV-1-specific CTLp frequencies were seen only in association with partial HAART failure in 1 patient. In conclusion, restoration of CD4+ T lymphocyte responsiveness to recall Ags is achieved during HAART. The data provide evidence for limited HIV-1-specific CD4+ memory T cells during advanced HIV-1 infection and suggest that both CD4+ and CD8+ HIV-1-specific T cells are poorly stimulated when viral load is suppressed."
6302,0.002,2.0,"In order to study the effect of increased CD4 cell counts on the biology of hepatitis C virus (HCV), we analyzed the genetic variability of HCV generated over 8 y in eight human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HCV co-infected patients. This was a retrospective study in which HIV patients were selected who had profound immune impairment evident over four years and were co-infected with HCV genotype 1 and who then went on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). These patients achieved different degrees of immune reconstitution, measured as increased CD4 cell counts during a 4- to 8-y period, following initiation of HAART. HCV genetic variability was determined by measuring the genetic diversity (Hamming distance, HD), and complexity (number of viral variants) in plasma samples collected at yearly intervals just before and after the initiation of HAART. The parameters were assessed by molecular cloning and sequencing of a 575-bp fragment including the HCV envelope 1 and envelope 2 genes (E1/E2), containing the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1). significantly increased HVR1 genetic diversity was observed in analyzed samples where the patients' CD4 cell counts were > or =100 compared with CD4 cell counts <100. A significant increase in genetic diversity in HVR1 was detected in co-infected patients whose CD4 cell counts increased from <100 to >400 over a period of more than 4 y of HAART therapy. This was in contrast to a minimal increase in HCV genetic diversity of HVR1 occurring in patients whose CD4 cell counts failed to rise much over 200 over 7 y of follow up. Insertion and deletion of HCV genomic fragments in the E1/E2 region was documented in one patient who developed fulminant hepatitis C."

Ten HLA-A2+, HIV+ asymptomatic patients with CD4+ T cells >500/mm3 were given two courses of HIV-1 MN rgp160 vaccine over a 2-year period. Envelope epitope-specific CTL responses, using PBMCs, were measured against peptide-coated autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines. Optimum CTL epitopes were determined by HLA-A2-binding affinity of 9- to 10-mer peptides containing the HLA-A2.1-binding motif. Ten of the high- or intermediate-binding peptides were conserved among >50% of reported clade B HIV strains. These peptide-specific CTL activities and the patient virus sequences in peptide-coding regions were monitored. Six patients showed envelope peptide-specific CTL responses, which correlated with the presence of whole envelope antigen-specific CTL responses. Five of these patients, who showed responses to epitopes in the gp41 region (aa 814-824), had preimmunization virus similar to the vaccine sequence in this region. Three patients who did not show these epitope-specific responses had initially different sequences in the HIV gene encoding that region. The epitope-specific CTL responses appear to reflect recall responses, as only patients infected with virus containing the vaccine sequence developed them and they could be recalled with a second set of vaccine injections. This appears to be reminiscent of the concept of T cell ""original antigenic sin."" This vaccine was also immunogenic as measured by gp160-specific lymphocyte-proliferative responses. However, increased immune responses did not impact the HIV load or CTL epitope sequences during therapy."

This cross-sectional study was conducted to establish the awareness and attitude about HCV infections among 210 full-time and part-time nursing students of the Medical College in Bitola, Macedonia from May to June 2009. For this purpose we used a self-administered questionnaire which consisted of three parts. The first included demographic data, the second included questions about causes of infection, mode of transmission, symptoms, acute and chronic hepatitis, and prevention, and the third questions about students' attitude toward patients with suspect or confirmed HCV infection. Full-time students showed higher HCV awareness (84 %) than part-time students (69 %). 58 % of the full-time and 79 % of the part-time students said they would not avoid professional contact with suspect or HCV infected patients. Our study has shown that even though both groups of students have a sufficient knowledge about HCV to face future challenges, they need further education on the subject.

6871,0.002,2.0,"Interruption of suppressive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected patients leads to increased HIV replication and viral rebound in peripheral blood. Effects of therapy interruption on gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) have not been well investigated. We evaluated longitudinal changes in viral replication and emergence of viral variants in the context of T cell homeostasis and gene expression in GALT of three HIV-positive patients who initiated HAART during primary HIV infection but opted to interrupt therapy thereafter. Longitudinal viral sequence analysis revealed that a stable proviral reservoir was established in GALT during primary HIV infection that persisted through early HAART and post-therapy interruption. Proviral variants in GALT and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) displayed low levels of genomic diversity at all times. A rapid increase in viral loads with a modest decline of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood was observed, while gut mucosal CD4(+) T cell loss was severe following HAART interruption. This was accompanied by increased mucosal gene expression regulating interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses and immune activation, a profile similar to those found in HAART-naive HIV-infected patients. Sequence analysis of rebound virus suggested that GALT was not the major contributor to the postinterruption plasma viremia nor were GALT HIV reservoirs rapidly replaced by HIV rebound variants. Our data suggest an early establishment and persistence of viral reservoirs in GALT with minimal diversity. Early detection of and therapy for HIV infection may be beneficial in controlling viral evolution and limiting establishment of diverse viral reservoirs in the mucosal compartment."
7568,0.002,2.0,"We previously found that human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly GBV-C) NS3 protease activity inhibits Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication in a CD4+ T cell line. Given the protease׳s similarity to the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease, we characterized HPgV protease activity and asked whether it affects the type I interferon response or is inhibited by HCV protease antagonists. We characterized the activity of proteases with mutations in the catalytic triad and demonstrated that the HCV protease inhibitors Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Danoprevir do not affect HPgV protease activity. HPgV NS3 protease cleaved MAVS but not TRIF, and it inhibited interferon responses sufficiently to enhance growth of an interferon-sensitive virus. Therefore, HPgV׳s inhibition of the interferon response could help promote HPgV persistence, which is associated with clinical benefits in HIV-infected patients. Our results also imply that HCV protease inhibitors should not interfere with the beneficial effects of HPgV in HPgV/HCV/HIV infected patients. "

8675,0.002,2.0,"In response to the confirmed transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from a surgeon to several patients in the Netherlands, a 'Committee for Prevention of Iatrogenic Hepatitis B' was established in 2000. During the years 2000-2008, the committee reviewed 99 cases of HBV-infected health care workers. Fifty of them were found to perform exposure prone procedures (EPPs). Because of high levels of HBV DNA (>100,000 copies/ml), a ban on performing EPPs was applied in 11/50 cases; 25/50 low-viremic health care workers were allowed to continue EPPs while their HBV load was being monitored; and 14/50 cases had stopped working or changed profession. In five restricted workers who started oral antiviral treatment, HBV replication was persistently suppressed, enabling the ban on EPPs to be lifted. Throughout the European Union different levels of HBV viremia have been chosen, above which health care workers are not allowed to perform EPPs. It remains unknown how this affects the safety of patients. Application in the Netherlands of a European or a British guideline would have, respectively, doubled or tripled the number of restricted health care workers."
8220,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are leading causes of death from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Because underreporting has complicated the understanding of disease burden, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine requested that CDC perform a comprehensive evaluation of national viral hepatitis surveillance. Hepatitis surveillance data rely on local and state estimates, and a better understanding of reporting at these levels can inform strategies to improve national data quality. As an initial assessment, CDC partnered with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and an urban health-care system in southeastern Michigan to evaluate the completeness of reporting (including case status, demographic, and risk factor information) of cases of chronic HBV and HCV infection among persons who were enrolled in a multicenter chronic hepatitis cohort study to the MDCH viral hepatitis registry. This report summarizes the results of that assessment. Among clinically confirmed chronic hepatitis infections, 82% of HBV infections and 65% of HCV infections were reported. Completeness of reporting of chronic HBV and HCV infections was significantly improved for those with more recent clinical diagnoses, but reporting still remained incomplete. The completeness of reporting varied significantly by demographic characteristics of patients with HCV infection. Few reports of either HBV or HCV infection included risk factors. Improving surveillance of chronic hepatitis in Michigan will require exploration of more efficient methods for the transfer of laboratory and clinical data and evaluation of the most appropriate sources for risk factor information to aid in the prevention of viral hepatitis transmission. Similar collaborations with health-care institutions that use electronic International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes and laboratory data can provide local and state health departments with insight into the challenges to case reporting in their jurisdictions."

However, the initial systemic HIV-1 Env-specific antibody response targets gp41 epitopes and fails to control acute-phase viremia. African-origin, natural simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) hosts do not typically progress to AIDS and rarely postnatally transmit virus to their infants, despite high milk viral loads. Conversely, SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs), Asian-origin nonnatural SIV hosts, sustain pathogenic SIV infections and exhibit higher rates of postnatal virus transmission. In this study, of acute SIV infection, we compared the initial systemic Env-specific B cell responses of AGMs and RMs in order to probe potential factors influencing the lack of disease progression observed in AGMs. AGMs developed higher-magnitude plasma gp120-specific IgA and IgG responses than RMs, whereas RMs developed more robust gp140-directed IgG responses. These gp120-focused antibody responses were accompanied by rapid autologous neutralizing responses during acute SIV infection in AGMs compared to RMs. Moreover, acute SIV infection elicited a higher number of circulating Env-specific memory B cells in peripheral blood of AGMs than in the blood of RMs. These findings indicate that AGMs have initial systemic Env-specific B cell responses to SIV infection distinct from those of a nonnatural SIV host, resulting in more functional SIV-specific humoral responses, which may be involved in impairing pathogenic disease progression and minimizing postnatal transmission."
7540,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The likelihood of developing CHB is related to the age at which infection is acquired; the risk being lowest in adults and >90% in neonates whose mothers are hepatitis B e antigen positive. Treatment of CHB infection aims to clear HBV DNA and prevent the development of complications. There are currently seven drugs available for the treatment of CHB: five nucleos(t)ide analogues and two interferon-based therapies. Long-term treatment is often required, and the decision to treat is based on clinical assessment including the phase of CHB infection and the presence and extent of liver damage. A safe and effective HBV vaccine has been available since the early 1980s. Vaccination plays a central role in HBV prevention strategies worldwide, and a decline in the incidence and prevalence of HBV infection following the introduction of universal HBV vaccination programmes has been observed in many countries including the USA and parts of South East Asia and Europe. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with HBV vaccine +/- hepatitis B immunoglobulin is highly effective in preventing mother to child transmission and in preventing transmission following sharps injuries, sexual contact and other exposures to infected blood and body fluids. Transmission of HBV in the health care setting has become an increasingly rare event in developed nations. However, it remains a significant risk in developing countries reflecting the higher prevalence of CHB, limited access to HBV vaccination and PEP and a lack of adherence to standard infection control precautions."
5542,0.002,2.0,"Introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy has profoundly altered both the course and prognosis of the disease in HIV-infected persons. Indeed, protease inhibitor-containing antiretroviral combination therapy dramatically decreased morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life of HIV-infected persons. Recent data, however, have raised concerns that antiretroviral combination therapy is associated with premature manifestation of coronary artery disease. In particular, protease inhibitors have been linked to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, abnormalities in lipid metabolism and lipodystrophy and increased coronary artery calcification. Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions whether the incidence of myocardial infarction is indeed increased in this patient population. The most substantial database has recently been provided by the D:A:D study group who demonstrated an increased incidence of myocardial infarction in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-containing therapy in a prospective observational cohort study. Much about the mechanisms involved leading to this finding remain elusive. Surrogate markers such as endothelial function may help to delineate potential mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction is a key event in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease. It is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Furthermore endothelial ""activation"" leading to a pro-inflammatory, proliferative and prothrombotic state of the endothelium occurs. The observed accelerated atherosclerosis could either be caused by the virus infection itself or by a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, protease inhibitors in particular. Experimental studies demonstrate a direct impact of viral components (gp120, TAT) on the endothelium, as they lead to expression of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], E-selectin), a prothrombotic state (increase of von Willebrand factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-[PAI-]1, tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], tissue factor). In addition, soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, ICAM) were found to be increased in HIV-infected persons. Impaired flow-mediated dilation can already be detected in HIV-infected children, independent of antiretroviral therapy. Another study showed a correlation between viral load and flow-mediated dilation, supporting the notion of infection/inflammation as a contributor to endothelial dysfunction. The influence of protease inhibitor therapy on the endothelium was investigated in several studies in vitro and in vivo. In experimental studies certain protease inhibitors downregulated eNOS expression, and induced CD36 scavenger receptor expression. Furthermore, apoptosis, radical oxygen species (ROS), proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelin-1 were found to be increased. There is conflicting evidence about adhesion molecules, as some investigators detected a decrease by therapy, others did not see an effect. In clinical studies all but one investigator found endothelial function to be impaired in HIV-infected persons on protease inhibitor-containing regimens. An important study to underline the hypothesis of a link between protease inhibitor therapy comes from Dubé et al. showing that in healthy volunteers, indinavir caused impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilation after 4 weeks. In a wide variety of clinical conditions lipid-lowering therapy using statins has shown to improve endothelial function as well as hard clinical endpoints. Drug interactions caused by common metabolism of protease inhibitors and most statins by the P450 3A4 pathway limit the use of these drugs it this setting. Pravastatin, which is being metabolized independently of P450 enzymes, was tested in several studies. In one study a trend toward improvement of endothelial function was observed. In an own similar study the authors recently provided evidence of a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in 30 HIV-infected persons. These studies support current guidelines of treating protease inhibitor-associated dyslipidemia with statins, preferably pravastatin.. Many questions remain unanswered in the context of antiretroviral therapy and cardiovascular risk. Results gained from research of endothelial function have served to delineate certain potential mechanisms, much work is yet to be done."
8716,0.002,2.0,"Although carrier rates for the HBsAg as well as the prevalence of HBV-associated chronic liver disease (CALD) are known to be high in Nigeria, not much is known about the role of the hepatitis C (HCV) and D (HDV) viruses. We undertook a prospective serological study of a cohort of 50 new patients and attending a Nigerian teaching hospital for various forms of histologically characterised chronic liver disease. Forty-five patients (90%) had antibodies to HBcAg (anti-HBcAb). Thirty one patients (62%) were HBsAg-positive, out of whom 15 were HbeAg-positive. Two (4%) of the HbsAg-positive patients, both suffering from liver cancer, were also hepatitis D antigen positive. Similarly, two (4%) patients were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. There were no cases of co-infection by the HBV and HCV. This study suggests that while the HBV is the major aetiological agent of chronic liver disease in Nigeria, the HDV is not an important aggravating factor save in a small number of patients. The HCV is probably not yet an important cause of chronic liver disease but this situation might change when HBV infection is controlled."

The surveys were distributed through the mail in three separate waves with a postcard reminder. A total of 2,725 individuals provided completed questionnaires (34% response rate). We assessed the AIDS and HIV-related knowledge level of these health professionals, compared their knowledge levels, and identified variables that predict a high level of knowledge. The overall test scores indicate a definite need for AIDS education among these health professionals; on average, doctors answered 71% of the knowledge items correctly; dentists, 66%; and nurses, 65%. Doctors scored higher than the other health professionals on almost all of the 38 items relating to the epidemiological aspects of HIV, transmission, identification and reporting of HIV disease and AIDS, and assessment of HIV-associated risks. The multivariate regression model explained 24% of the variability in knowledge score (P = .0001) and identified the following independent variables as significant predictors of knowledge score: age, race, marital status, religious beliefs, political orientation, professional group, average number of hours worked each week, experience with HIV+/AIDS patients, knowledge self-assessment, and sources of AIDS information."
1413,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been associated with a number of hepatic and biliary tract disorders. Case reports, series of liver biopsies, and postmortem studies that examined the hepatobiliary system were retrieved with a MEDLARS search and form the basis of this review. The liver and biliary tract are frequently involved with opportunistic infections (most commonly mycobacteria and cytomegalovirus) and neoplasms (mainly Kaposi's sarcoma) in patients with HIV infection. The patients are often asymptomatic but may have elevated levels of serum liver enzymes. These abnormalities are nonspecific. Sulfa drugs, pentamidine, and ketoconazole are the medications used in HIV-related infections that are most likely to result in abnormalities on liver tests. Acalculous cholecystitis and sclerosing cholangitis also occur in HIV infection. Cytomegalovirus and Cryptosporidium are the organisms most commonly associated with these conditions. Imaging studies of the liver may detect parenchymal abnormalities and guide liver biopsy. The role of this procedure in the diagnosis of opportunistic infections and neoplasms is controversial because these lesions are generally disseminated at the time liver abnormalities are evident. A liver biopsy is best used when other less invasive procedures have failed to provide a diagnosis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a useful diagnostic procedure with therapeutic potential in patients with abdominal pain, fever, or an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level."
6290,0.002,2.0,"Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an immune-mediated condition characterized by infiltration of the involved organs by IgG4-bearing plasma cells. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases, associated with or occurring in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, has been increasing. We describe a 58-year-old man with an undiagnosed HIV infection, which presented as chronic cervical lymphadenopathy with an elevated serum IgG4 and a very high IgE. Histologically, lymph nodes showed expanded sinusoids and burnt-out germinal centers with increased plasmacytic infiltration and collagen fiber deposition. The absolute number of IgG4+ plasma cells and the IgG4+/IgG+ plasma cell ratio was increased. The lymph nodes were enlarged and clinically the patient improved after steroid treatment. Nine months later, he was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, following presentation with a cavitary left lung lesion. Immunohistochemical studies on the previously resected lymph node revealed complete absence of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes. The pathologic findings met the criteria of both HIV infection and IgG4-related lymphadenopathy. Our case demonstrates that further investigations for underlying HIV infection in a case of IgG4-RD are critical, especially when extremely elevated IgE is concomitantly present."
6906,0.002,2.0,"Following treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) monoinfection, HBV-specific T-cell responses increase significantly; however, little is known about the recovery of HBV-specific T-cell responses following HBV-active highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-HBV coinfected patients. HIV-HBV coinfected patients who were treatment naïve and initiating HBV-active HAART were recruited as part of a prospective cohort study in Thailand and followed for 48 weeks (n = 24). Production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in both HBV- and HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells was quantified using intracellular cytokine staining on whole blood. Following HBV-active HAART, the median (interquartile range) log decline from week 0 to week 48 for HBV DNA was 5.8 log (range, 3.4 to 6.7) IU/ml, and for HIV RNA it was 3.1 (range, 2.9 to 3.5) log copies/ml (P < 0.001 for both). The frequency of HIV Gag-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses significantly decreased (IFN-gamma, P < 0.001; TNF-alpha, P = 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant change in the frequency (IFN-gamma, P = 0.21; TNF-alpha, P = 0.61; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.11) or magnitude (IFN-gamma, P = 0.13; TNF-alpha, P = 0.13; and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, P = 0.13) of HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses over 48 weeks of HBV-active HAART. Of the 14 individuals who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positive, 5/14 (36%) lost HBeAg during the 48 weeks of follow-up. HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells were detected in 4/5 (80%) of patients prior to HBeAg loss. Results from this study show no sustained change in the HBV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response following HBV-active HAART. These findings may have implications for the duration of treatment of HBV in HIV-HBV coinfected patients, particularly in HBeAg-positive disease."
7249,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) evolves rapidly in the host. The computer analysis of the HIV-1 genome has shown that the mutation manner is dependent on oligonucleotide sequences (in particular, six bases long); thus HIV-1 adaptively evolves. The six-base-long interaction between template-primer oligonucleotide and the reverse transcriptase (RT) has been revealed by the crystal structure of RT, in vitro termination assay of plymerization, and hydroxyl radical footprint analysis. It has been thought that AIDS is caused by the large numbers of HIV-1 quasispecies yielded by the adaptive and rapid evolution in the host. However, the slow evolution and the high levels of viral RNA in the progressive HIV-1 infected individuals (progressives) were recently reported; in contrast, the adaptive and rapid evolution and the low viral-RNA levels were reported in the non-progressives. This suggests that the physiological environment, e.g. pH and dNTP balance, in which RT works in the progressives is different from that in the non-progressives."
1510,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) production continues in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with undetectable (<50 copies/mL) virus loads. Our initial cross-sectional study showed that this viremia is composed of viruses that lack new resistance mutations to the HAART regimen. Here we describe a longitudinal, clonal genotypic analysis of plasma virus loads in treated adults who had undetectable virus loads. We document a continuous production of virus in 8 HIV-1-infected adults who maintained suppression of viremia for up to 15 months. Using analytical approaches for distinguishing selected resistance mutations from nonselected mutations and polymerase chain reaction errors, we detected no evolution of resistance in the reverse-transcriptase and protease genes. Sporadic resistance mutations were detected in some viral clones that were not selected for subsequently. Thus, in some patients, HAART suppresses replication to a level that does not allow the evolution of drug resistance over a time frame of years."
693,0.002,2.0,"In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) assays compared with enzyme immunoassay and Western blot and to assess their potential use for routine screening in an emergency department (ED), we analyzed sera from 492 consecutive ED patients using an identity-unlinked design. Sera were analyzed for HIV-1 by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot and two rapid assays: the Abbott Testpack HIV-1 (Abbott Labs, Inc, Abbott Park, IL) and the HIV-1 Genie, (Genetic Systems, Seattle, WA). Seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 492 samples was 5.1%. Both rapid assays were easy to perform and required approximately 10 minutes per test. Sensitivity and specificity of both rapid assays were 100% and 99.8%, with positive and negative predictive values of 96.2% and 100%, respectively. It was concluded that both rapid assays showed high concordance with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Since the ED is often the primary care setting for many patients at risk for HIV-1, the ED may be an optimal site for routine HIV-1 screening. Rapid assay screening may provide the opportunity for timely identification of HIV-1-infected patients, allowing earlier treatment and counseling. However, ethical and practical questions regarding appropriate application of rapid HIV-1 testing in EDs still needs resolution."
6218,0.002,2.0,"The goal in this article is to examine social problems associated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence in Mexico and the related challenges for Mexican persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). The study was conducted from the perspective of infected and affected individuals. The authors completed 64 in-depth interviews with heterosexual male and female PLWHAs, as well as with some key individuals from their social network. Following the principles of grounded theory, they carried out inductive analysis to create codes and organize central themes. The authors identified problems related to accessing HAART and found that conditions for implementing recommendations made in the international literature to improve adherence are poor. The findings highlight the importance of social factors, such as health care system irregularities, ineffective physician-patient communication, and availability of family and other sources of social support such as self-help groups for PLWHAs' access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in Mexico."
470,0.002,2.0,"A T cell clone (ACH-2) derived from T cells infected with HIV-1 was found to produce HIV-1 in response to stimulation with a monokine-enriched supernatant prepared by culturing human monocyte/macrophages with bacterial LPS (LPS-MO SN). Monokine induction of ACH-2 cells resulted in augmented virus production reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity and in the synthesis of all major viral proteins. Examination of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that 10 to 15% of uninduced cells constitutively expressed HIV proteins, whereas 100% showed positive immunofluorescence in response to LPS-MO SN. This induction of virus by LPS-MO SN resulted in approximately a 100-fold increase of infectious virus production over uninduced ACH-2 cells. LPS alone could not induce HIV-1 expression, whereas LPS-MO SN resulted in the greatest virus expression. Cell separation studies confirmed the source of the inducing factor(s) to be cells bearing the mature monocyte/macrophage marker, Leu M3. Biochemical fractionation of the LPS-MO SN suggested that one or more factors, having apparent Mr of approximately 45 kDa, were involved in this induction. Absorption of the LPS-MO SN with immunoaffinity gels specific for human TNF-alpha was shown to completely remove the HIV inducing activity for the ACH-2 cell line."
4981,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies characterized the third variable (V3) loop of the envelope gp120 as the principal neutralizing determinant for laboratory T-cell-line-adapted (TCLA) strains of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, primary viruses isolated from infected individuals are more refractory to neutralization than TCLA strains, suggesting that qualitatively different neutralizing antibodies may be involved. In this study, we investigated whether the V3 loop constitutes a linear target epitope for antibodies neutralizing primary isolates. By using peptides representative of the V3 regions of various primary isolates, an early, relatively specific and persistent antibody response was detected in sera from HIV-infected patients. To assess the relationship between these antibodies and neutralization, the same peptides were used in competition and depletion experiments. Addition of homologous V3 peptides led to a competitive inhibition in the neutralization of the TCLA strain HIVMN/MT-4 but had no effect on the neutralization of the autologous primary isolate. Similarly, the removal of antibodies that bind to linear V3 epitopes resulted in a loss of HIVMN/MT-4 neutralization, whereas no decrease in the autologous neutralization was measured. The different roles of V3-specific antibodies according to the virus considered were thereby brought to light. This confirmed the involvement of V3 antibodies in the neutralization of a TCLA strain but emphasized a more pronounced contribution of either conformational epitopes or epitopes outside the V3 loop as targets for antibodies neutralizing primary HIV-1 isolates. This result underlines the need to focus on new vaccinal immunogens with epitopes able to induce broadly reactive and efficient antibodies that neutralize a wide range of primary HIV-1 isolates."

NVP- or 3TC-only regimens were associated with median mtDNA:nDNA ratios that were significantly higher than those for ddI- and d4T+ddI-containing regimens (P<.01) but that were not significantly higher than those for d4T- or ZDV-containing regimens. Patients received thymidine analogue- and/or ddI-containing regimens for a shorter time (median, 14 vs. 24 months; P<.01). Because of survivor-bias effect, these results may represent a conservative estimate of these nucleosides' effect on mtDNA."
85,0.002,2.0,"The oral cavity is rarely reported to be a site of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, despite detectable virus in saliva and relatively frequent prevalence of periodontal disease in HIV-infected persons yielding increased excretion of mononuclear-cell-enriched gingival fluid. To search for possible sources of HIV in saliva, and using the polymerase chain-reaction technique, we sought the presence and shedding patterns of proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid in a group of patients previously determined as HIV-1-seropositive. Periodontal status at the collection sites was monitored by several clinical parameters, including Plaque Index, Gingival Index, probing depth, and clinical attachment loss. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected by means of paper points. Proviral HIV-1 DNA was detected in the gingival fluid of 17 out of 35 HIV-1-infected patients. Its detection correlated significantly with higher plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.03) and not with peripheral blood CD4+ cell count, the presence of blood in gingival fluid, or oral lesions. There was a significant correlation between clinical attachment loss at the sites of fluid collection and plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (p = 0.002), and borderline correlation between the latter and probing depth (p = 0.54) in the group of patients harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA in gingival crevicular fluid. The results of our study suggest that mononuclear cells present in gingival crevicular fluid and harboring proviral HIV-1 DNA could represent a potential source of HIV-1 in the presence or absence of local bleeding, especially in persons with advanced HIV infection and increased loss of clinical attachment."

The aims of this study were; (1) to investigate the reasons for the prescription of the screening for hepatitis B and C; (2) to determine HCV and HBV prevalence among 462 patients attending the Saint Camille Centre and (3) to identify patients with acute hepatitis or with chronic hepatitis for better monitoring. From February to May 2012, 462 patients attending the laboratory of the Saint Camille Medical Centre with viral hepatitis suspicion were screened. The hepatitis B and C serological markers were detected through Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) technique using commercial reagent kits. The clinical symptoms were also recorded for each patient. The results revealed that, the main clinical symptoms that prompted physicians to request HBV and HCV screenings were: asthenia (39.4%), anorexia (21.2%), abdominal pains (19.0%), nausea (10.4%), others (10.0%). The prevalence of HbsAg was 29.4% among the screened people. Patients with acute hepatitis B, active chronic hepatitis B and non-active chronic hepatitis B represented 11.2, 2.2 and 16.0%, respectively. The acquisition of immunity against HBV after vaccination was attempted for 11.7% people. HCV prevalence was 3.9% and its coinfection with HBV was 2.2%. This study showed a high prevalence for hepatitis B and C among patients attending Saint Camille Medical Centre. Without hygiene education and HBV/HCV prevention, viral hepatitis infection will become a serious public health problem in Burkina Faso."

The control group included children with other disease who had applied to the outpatient clinic during the study period and had no history of jaundice or transfusion. Sixty-five (47.4%) patients with cancer and 7 (20%) children in the control group were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (p < 0.01). HBV DNA was detected in 59 (43.1%) patients and in 9 (20%) controls (p < 0.01). HCV specific antibody (anti-HCV) was detected in 8 (5.8%) patients and in 1 (2.2%) control (p > 0.05). Eight patients (5.8%) had circulating HCV RNA, but none had in the control group (p = 0.09). Ten (13.9%) of the 72 patients who were negative for HBsAg had circulating HBV DNA, and 7 (5.4%) of the 129 patients who were negative for anti-HCV had circulating HCV RNA. We concluded that HBV and HCV infections are common among Turkish children with cancer. In countries where HBV infection is widespread among the general population as in Turkey, children with cancer are under greater risk for HBV infection."
292,0.002,2.0,"Study of the mechanism of transmission of hepatitis B virus is important for public health. An improved experimental model is described for studying vertical transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) via human spermatozoa. Recombinant plasmid pIRES2-EGFP-HBx which would express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) used as a marker for the expression of hepatitis B virus X (HBx) gene was constructed successfully and confirmed by PCR, EcoR I and Sal I digestion, and DNA sequencing. After exposure to the plasmid, human spermatozoa were used to fertilize zona-free hamster ova in vitro. Two-cell embryos were collected and classified into group A with green fluorescence and group B without green fluorescence under fluorescence microscope. The results showed that HBx DNA positive bands were detected in the embryos with green fluorescence (PCR and RT-PCR) and positive controls (PCR) indicating presence and expression of HBx gene. In contrast, HBx gene expression was not detected in the embryos without green fluorescence and negative controls (PCR and RT-PCR). This improved experimental model is more efficient, accurate and reliable for studying further perinatal transmission of HBV or other viruses causing chronic human disease possibly via the male germ line."
1360,0.002,2.0,"TNFα has been shown to play a role in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced insulin resistance (IR). Polymorphism of the IL28B gene that encodes IFN-lambda 3 may be associated with IR through modulation of TNFα. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype, the level of TNFα activation and the degree of IR in patients with chronic hepatitis C. One hundred and thirty-three nondiabetic genotype 1 HCV-infected patients with biopsy proven noncirrhotic hepatitis C were investigated for IR (using HOMA index), IL28B rs12979860 genotype and fasting circulating levels of soluble receptor 1 of TNFα (sTNFR1) and adipokines: leptin, adiponectin and IL-6. The HOMA-IR was positively correlated with serum levels of leptin (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) and sTNFR1 (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) but not with IL-6 or adiponectin. IL28B rs12979860 CC genotype was observed in 35% patients. Genotype CC and nongenotype CC patients were similar in terms of HOMA-IR (means 1.6 ± 0.9 vs 1.7 ± 1.4) and had similar circulating levels of sTNFR1 and adipokines. Independent factors associated with IR were ferritin (OR = 1.002, P = 0.02), leptin (OR = 1.06, P = 0.02) and sTNFR1 (OR = 7.9, P = 0.04). This study suggests that in nondiabetic, noncirrhotic, HCV genotype 1-infected patients, there is no relationship between IL28B rs12979860 genotype and HOMA-IR or sTNFR1 level. HCV-related IR may be mediated through TNFα independent of IL28B genotype. "

620,0.002,2.0,"Recent reports show that the frequency of HBsAg varies around 4 to 6% in most Mediterranean and Middle East countries. Those areas are therefore considered as areas of intermediate endemicity for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate the HBV global situation in Tunisia, by means of third generation testing methods. Blood samples were obtained from 3 distinct population groups from Tunis: blood donors, consisting of young male adults staff members and patients from 4 haemodialysis units patients with either acute hepatitis or liver cirrhosis They were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc by radioimmunoassay tests. HBsAg was detected in 6.5% of the young male adults, and approximately 60% had either anti-HBs or anti-HBc antibodies. Haemodialysis staff members and patients respectively displayed 9.1% and 19.5% of HBsAg positivity, but an increase of HBsAg positivity and of all HBV serum markers in relation to the amount of time spent in dialysis units was shown among the patients. After 3 years of dialysis sessions, none remained seronegative. HBsAg was detected in approximately two-thirds of the patients with acute hepatitis or liver cirrhosis, and all cirrhosis patients had at least one HBV serum marker. These global results stress the importance of HBV infection in Tunisia. Immunization against hepatitis B virus therefore has to be considered. Nevertheless, the immunization strategy must take into account the epidemiological and economic characteristics of the country."

To help define an appropriate preventive policy, we determined the prevalence of HCV infection among EPP-performing medical personnel in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The prevalence of HCV infection was studied among 729 EPP-performing health care workers. Serum samples, stored after post-hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination testing in the years 2000-2009, were tested for HCV antibodies. Repeat reactive samples were confirmed by immunoblot assay and the detection of HCV RNA. The average age of the 729 health care workers was 39 years (range 18-66), suggesting a considerable cumulative occupational exposure to the blood. Nevertheless, only one of the 729 workers (0.14%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: <0.01% to 0.85%) was tested and confirmed to be positive for anti-HCV and positive for HCV RNA, which is comparable to the prevalence of HCV among Amsterdam citizens. Against this background, for the protection of personnel and patients, careful follow-up after needlestick injuries may be sufficient. If a zero-risk approach is desirable and costs are less relevant, the recurrent screening of EPP-performing personnel for HCV is superior to the follow-up of reported occupational exposures."

Mutations in the pol gene of HBV, either from selection of primary or secondary resistance mutations, typically result in changes in the overlapping hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and pattern of ADAPVEMs in Turkish patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB)."
944,0.002,2.0,"For HIV-infected children, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is often assessed by caregiver report but there are few data on their validity. We conducted prospective evaluations with 191 children ages 0-14 years and their caregivers over 6 months in western Kenya to identify questionnaire items that best predicted adherence to ART. Medication Event Monitoring Systems(®) (MEMS, MWV/AARDEX Ltd., Switzerland) electronic dose monitors were used as external criterion for adherence. We employed a novel variable selection tool using the LASSO technique with logistic regression to identify items best correlated with dichotomized MEMS adherence (≥90 or <90 % doses taken). Nine of 48 adherence items were identified as the best predictors of adherence, including missed or late doses in the past 7 days, problems giving the child medicines, and caregiver-level factors like not being present at medication taking. These items could be included in adherence assessment tools for pediatric patients. "
7683,0.002,2.0,"The T-cell-mediated immune response plays a crucial role in defense against hepatotropic viruses as well as in the pathogenesis of viral chronic hepatitides. However, very little is known about the role of specific T cells during hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection in humans. In this study, the T-cell response to HDV in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers with HDV superinfection was investigated at different levels. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation in response to a recombinant form of large hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) revealed that 8 of 30 patients studied (27%) specifically responded to HDAg. By employing synthetic peptides spanning the entire HDAg sequence, we found that T-cell recognition was directed against different antigenic determinants, with patient-to-patient variation in the pattern of response to peptides. Interestingly, all responders had signs of inactive HDV-induced disease, while none of the patients with active disease and none of the control subjects showed any significant proliferation. More accurate information about the specific T-cell response was obtained at the clonal level. A panel of HDAg-specific CD4+ T-cell clones from three HDV-infected individuals and fine-specificity analysis revealed that the clones tested individually recognized four epitopes corresponding to amino acids (aa) 26 to 41, 50 to 65, 66 to 81, or 106 to 121 of HDAg sequence. The study of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction revealed that peptides 50 to 65 and 106 to 121 were presented to specific T cells in association with multiple class II molecules. In addition, peptide 26 to 41 was efficiently generated after processing of HDAg through the endogenous processing pathway. Cytokine secretion analysis showed that all the CD4+ T-cell clones assayed were able to produce high levels of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), belonging either to T helper-1 (Th1) or Th0 subsets and that some of them were cytotoxic in a specific assay. This study provides the first evidence that detection of a specific T-cell response to HDAg in the peripheral blood of individuals with hepatitis delta is related to the decrease of HDV-induced disease activity. The HDAg epitopes identified here and particularly those recognized by CD4+ T cells in association with multiple major histocompatibility complex class II molecules may be potentially exploited for the preparation of a vaccine for prophylaxis and therapy of HDV infection."
4306,0.002,2.0,"Studies of the immune response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been hampered by the antigenic diversity of the HIV envelope protein. In an effort to predict the efficacy of vaccination we have compared the systemic anti-envelope antibody response in seronegative volunteers immunized with recombinant gp160 (either in vaccinia or as soluble protein produced in baculovirus) derived from the HTLV-IIIB strain of HIV-1 and in two laboratory workers accidentally infected with the same strain. 11 of 14 vaccinees responded to immunization by producing anti-gp160 of similar titer and the same isotype as that seen in the laboratory workers. Four vaccinees also had antibody to the principal neutralizing domain (V3 loop) that was comparable in titer with that seen in the laboratory workers, but the fine specificity of anti-V3 antibody was qualitatively different in the two groups. Antibody that can block the interaction between CD4 and gp120 was present at comparable levels in three vaccines and the lab workers. Neutralizing antibody titers were markedly lower in the vaccinees than in the laboratory workers. In seven of the vaccinees, an immunodominant epitope was at amino acid 720-740. Analyses of monoclonal antibodies to this region indicate that they do not neutralize, bind to infected cells, nor function as immunotoxins. Although the anti-gp160 antibody response was of similar magnitude in both infected and vaccinated individuals, there were important qualitative differences."

We tested the clinical significance of quantitative total and IgM-anti-HBc in well characterized chronic-HBsAg-carriers. Sera (212) were obtained from 111 HBsAg-carriers followed-up for 52 months (28-216) during different phases of chronic-HBV-genotype-D-infection: 10 HBeAg-positive, 25 inactive-carriers (HBV-DNA≤2000IU/ml, ALT<30U/L), 66 HBeAg-negative-CHB-patients and 10 with HDV-super-infection. In 35 patients treated with Peg-IFN±nucleos(t)ide-analogues (NUCs) sera were obtained at baseline, end-of-therapy and week-24-off-therapy and in 22 treated with NUCs (for 60 months, 42-134m) at baseline and end-of-follow-up. HBsAg and IgM-anti-HBc were measured by Architect-assays (Abbott, USA); total-anti-HBc by double-antigen-sandwich-immune-assay (Wantai, China); HBV-DNA by COBAS-TaqMan (Roche, Germany). Total-anti-HBc were detectable in all sera with lower levels in HBsAg-carriers without CHB (immune-tolerant, inactive and HDV-superinfected, median 3.26, range 2.26-4.49 Log10 IU/ml) versus untreated-CHB (median 4.68, range 2.76-5.54 Log10 IU/ml), p<0.0001. IgM-anti-HBc positive using the chronic-hepatitis-cut-off"" (0.130-S/CO) were positive in 102 of 212 sera (48.1%). Overall total-anti-HBc and IgM-anti-HBc correlated significantly (p<0.001, r=0.417). Total-anti-HBc declined significantly in CHB patients with response to Peg-IFN (p<0.001) and in NUC-treated patients (p<0.001); the lowest levels (median 2.68, range 2.12-3.08 Log10 IU/ml) were found in long-term responders who cleared HBsAg subsequently. During spontaneous and therapy-induced fluctuations of CHB (remissions and reactivations) total- and IgM-anti-HBc correlated with ALT (p<0.001, r=0.351 and p=0.008, r=0.185 respectively). Total-anti-HBc qualifies as a useful marker of HBV-induced-liver-disease that might help to discriminate major phases of chronic HBV infection and to predict sustained response to antivirals. "

6041,0.002,2.0,"Various domains of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are essential for the assembly and secretion of hepatitis D virus (HDV). This study investigated the influences of the levels and sequences of HBsAg of naturally occurring HBV variants on the assembly and secretion of HDV. Six hepatitis B virus (HBV)-producing plasmids (three genotype B and three genotype C) and six HBsAg expression plasmids that expressed various HBsAg levels were constructed from the sera of HDV-infected patients. These plasmids were cotransfected with six expression plasmids of HDV of genotype 1, 2, or 4 into the Huh-7 hepatoma cell line. Serum HBsAg and HBV DNA levels were correlated with HDV RNA levels and outcomes of chronic hepatitis D (CHD) patients. The secretion of genotype 1, 2, or 4 HDV generally correlated with HBsAg levels but not with HBV genotypes or HBV DNA levels. Swapping and residue mutagenesis experiments of HBsAg-coding sequences revealed that the residue Pro-62 in the cytosolic domain-I affects the assembly and secretion of genotype 2 and 4 HDV and not those of genotype 1. The pre-S2 N-terminal deletion HBV mutant adversely affects secretion of the three HDV genotypes. In patients, serum HDV RNA levels correlated with HBsAg levels but not with HBV DNA levels. Viremia of HDV or HBV correlated with poor outcomes. In conclusion, the assembly and secretion of HDV were influenced by the amounts and sequences of HBsAg. For an effective treatment of CHD, reduction of HBsAg production in addition to the suppression of HBV and HDV replication might be crucial."
821,0.002,2.0,"Recurring outbreaks of acute hepatitis have been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among Peruvian military personnel stationed in the Amazon Basin region of Peru. The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection was investigated as the possible cause of acute hepatitis among 88 military patients stationed at four different jungle outposts during 1992-1993. Analysis of serum markers indicated that 95% (84/88) had evidence of acute HBV infection; 64% (54/84) were also infected with HDV. Genetic analysis of PCR-amplified HDV and HBV fragments showed exclusively HDV genotype III and HBV genotype F. Furthermore, HDV RNA sequences were similar among patients from the same outpost but different from those at other jungle locations. The data suggested focal sources of HDV infection in the jungle environment of the outposts and, further, confirmed the unique association of HDV genotype III with severe cases of human disease in northern South America."
7390,0.002,2.0,"Epidemiological analyses indicate a decreasing level of hepatitis D (HDV) infections in most developed countries during the last 15 years. Romania, however, is one of the European countries that still has high morbidity from HDV; this study was performed in order to estimate the HDV prevalence in the Bucharest area. Three thousand four hundred sixty-one hepatitis B (HBV) infected patients were invited to participate and 1,094 were recruited. Serum anti-HDV IgG was detected in 223 patients indicating a hepatitis D seroprevalence of 20.4% (95% CI = 18.1-22.9) in patients chronically infected with HBV, less than that seen in previous studies. Seroprevalence was not gender related, but patients over 40 years were more likely to have anti-HDV antibodies, RR = 1.9 (1.2; 3.0). Detectable hepatitis D viraemia was found in 67.7% of the patients who were positive for anti-HDV. The HDV genotype was characterized for 40 isolates; all were very similar and belonged to genotype 1. Serum HBV-DNA was detectable less frequently in patients positive for anti-HDV than in patients infected with HBV alone: 68.5% versus 89.3%, OR 3.9 (1.7; 10.0), but the extent of this HDV replicative dominance varies with the sensitivity of the HBV-DNA detection. 19.3% of the subjects who tested positive for anti-HDV IgG had a HBV-DNA level higher than four logs. This high prevalence prompts the need for better HBV vaccination coverage and measures to prevent super infection with HDV in patients infected with HBV."

Increased HIV-2-specific T lymphocyte proliferative responses were detected in both groups compared to HIV-negative controls (healthy HIV-uninfected individuals without known exposure to an HIV-infected person); five out of 29 of the HIV-2-exposed uninfected and half (16 of 32) of the HIV-2-infected individuals had stimulation indexes >2, compared to one out of 49 of the HIV-negative controls (P = 0.003 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The exposed uninfected individuals had reactivity to a HIV-2 V3-peptide corresponding to amino acids 311-326 of the envelope glycoprotein, while the HIV-2-infected people reacted mainly to HIV-2 whole viral lysate. Thus, this study demonstrates a high degree of HIV-2-specific T helper cell activity, as measured by lymphocyte proliferation, in HIV-2-exposed uninfected individuals as well as in HIV-2-infected subjects. These immune responses could be important for resistance to the infection and for the control of established infection and, thus, play a role in the lower transmission and progression of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1."
9390,0.002,2.0,"Correlates of resistance to infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are important for defining potential therapeutic interventions and for prophylactic vaccination. In this study, 11 couples discordant in their HIV-1 infection status were prospectively evaluated for the presence of protective factors. Behavioral characteristics of all subjects entailed a high risk of transmission. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viruses isolated from the infected partner, and against laboratory virus isolates, were detected in 5 (45%) of 11 HIV-negative partners, including a CCR5Delta32-homozygous and a heterozygous subject. No CTL responses were observed in 6 control unexposed subjects. Marked variation in lymphocyte susceptibility to viral infection was noted. Resistance attributable to major histocompatibility complex discordance or anti-major histocompatibility complex antibodies was not identified. These results suggest that a combination of factors, including cellular immunity, viral characteristics, and coreceptor integrity, may be involved in the persistent nontransmission of HIV."
283,0.002,2.0,"To study the relation between general cellular immunity and the course of hepatitis B within a group of chronic hemodialysis patients, T-lymphocyte number and function were investigated in 13 persistently hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg)-positive patients, in 32 HBSAg-negative patients, and in 11 patients who had recovered from hepatitis B and compared with that of 21 age-matched controls. Phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte stimulation in vitro and the number of circulating T-cells in the HBSAg-positive group were significantly decreased as compared with those of the recovered group and the controls. Lymphocyte stimulation by pokeweed mitogen and by an antigen cocktail showed the same tendency, but no significant differences between the HBSAg-positive and the recovered groups. Uremic sera from the three patient groups had similar depressive effects on phytohemagglutinin induced lymphocyte stimulation of controls. Serum immunoglobulin G, (IgG), IgA, and IgM were normal in the three patient groups. It is concluded that chronic hemodialysis patients, who have become persistent HBSAg-carriers, have a significantly decreased T-lymphocyte number and function as compared with hemodialysis patients who are able to eliminat hepatitis B virus (HBV). The difference could not be ascribed to the HBV infection itself. This indicates that T-cells play an important role in the elimination of HBV in hemodialysis patients."
8050,0.002,2.0,"We have approached the development of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) therapeutic product by producing immune cells stably resistant to HIV-1. Promonocytic CD4+ cells (U937) were made resistant to HIV-1 by the introduction of a DNA construct (pNDU1A,B,C) that contained three independent antisense sequences directed against two functional regions, transactivation response and tat/rev, of the HIV-1 target. Each sequence was incorporated into the transcribed region of a U1 snRNA gene to generate U1/HIV antisense RNA. Stably transfected cells expressed all three U1/HIV antisense transcripts, and these transcripts accumulated in the nucleus. These cells were subjected to two successive challenges with HIV-1 (BAL strain). The surviving cells showed normal growth characteristics and have retained their CD4+ phenotype. In situ hybridization assays showed that essentially all of the surviving cells produced U1/HIV antisense RNA. No detectable p24 antigen was observed, no syncytium formation was observed, and PCR-amplified HIV gag sequences were not detected. Rechallenge with HIV-1 (IIIB strain) similarly yielded no infection at a relatively high multiplicity of infection. As a further demonstration that the antisense RNA directed against HIV-1 was functioning in these transfected immune cells, Tat-activated expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was shown to be specifically inhibited in cells expressing Tat and transactivation response region antisense sequences."
9052,0.002,2.0,"Mice immunized with the regulatory genes nef, rev, and tat from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 developed both humoral and cellular immune responses to the gene products Nef, Rev, and Tat. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to induce immune reactions to all of these regulatory gene products. Humoral responses were seen after DNA boosts, while potent T-cell proliferative responses were noted already after a single immunization. A Th1-directed immune response was demonstrated early after immunization. A 3- to 75-fold-stronger T-cell response was seen in animals receiving DNA epidermally compared to that in animals receiving intramuscular injections. Nef, Rev, and Tat putative B- and T-cell epitopes were clearly mapped by using peptides derived from the regulatory proteins and were similar to those which are detected in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Although immunization by the Nef, Rev, and Tat proteins raised high immunoglobulin G titers in serum, the epitope spreading appeared broader after DNA immunization. The combination of all of these regulatory genes together with two genes for structural proteins, the envelope and gag genes, demonstrated that a combined approach is feasible in that reactivities to all antigens persisted or were even augmented. No interference between plasmids was noted."
6037,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) often causes latent infection. Transactivation by some DNA viruses has been implicated in inducing HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis. The transactivator (IE-2) gene of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can enhance HIV-2 as well as HIV-1 gene expression in vitro. This inducer can act in concert with the HIV-2 tat gene and T-cell activation in enhancing gene expression in human CD4+ lymphocytes. While the HIV-2 and HIV-1 tat genes and T-cell activators apparently employ independent modes of action, the CMV transactivator in combination with the HIV-2 tat or T-cell activators may employ a gene activation pathway with some common and some distinct components. Both HIV-2 and CMV transactivators enhance HIV-2 gene expression by transcriptional activation involving transcript initiation as well as elongation, with CMV transactivator affecting elongation more than the initiation. A significant proportion of transcripts appear to terminate prematurely in the absence of transactivators. Deletion mutation analysis of the HIV-2 long terminal repeat (LTR) suggests that the element that responds to CMV transactivation in human CD4+ lymphocytes is either a diffuse one or located downstream of the HIV-2 enhancer element."

When the HCMV IE1 gene (pMP12) was cotransfected with pLTR-CAT into Vero cells the level of measurable CAT gene activity was below the level observed when pLTR-CAT was cotransfected with a nonspecific carrier plasmid (pGEM3). The negative influence of the HCMV IE1 gene product on the HIV-1 LTR in Vero cells was also observed when the HIV-1 tat gene (pLTR-TAT) was contransfected into Vero cells with pLTR-CAT and pMP12. However, when the HCMV IE1 gene was cotransfected into rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells with proviral HIV-1 DNA, an increase in viral production, as monitored by measurement of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase activity, was observed. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, nuclear extracts obtained 15 hr post-HCMV infection (hpi) were found to contain a lower level of interaction with an oligonucleotide which corresponded to the HIV-1 LTR Sp-1 binding motif. Nuclear extracts obtained 40 hpi of MRC-5 cells had a greater level of interaction with, and changed the mobility of, the Sp-1 oligonucleotide relative to the uninfected nuclear extracts. HCMV-infected MRC-5 cell nuclear extracts also contain a factor(s) which interacted with the HIV-1 LTR between nucleotide positions -15 to -2 relative to the HIV-1 mRNA start site."

We therefore studied EP in HIV-1 infected children with the aim of verifying the association of results with disease progression, clinical signs and electroencephalogram, and individualizing the most reliable test. Thirty-six patients (20 male and 16 female subjects, age range: 10 months to 12 years) belonging to a group of 45 symptomatic subjects seen at the Pediatric Department were included into the study from November 1991 to December 1994. Ten presented with neurological signs as of disease onset, eight others developed encephalopathy during the follow-up. One hundred seventeen EP, i.e., 27 pattern visual, 64 flash visual and 26 brain stem auditory EP, were recorded. Univariate statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test was done. As a whole, we found 22.5% of abnormal EP in subjects without neurological signs and 28.3% in subjects with neurological signs. Results that were obtained suggested a close relationship between both the pattern of visual and brain stem auditory EP exams and disease progression."

We determined full-length pol gene over 20 years and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reviewed medical records. Eighteen HPs experienced various opportunistic infections or clinical manifestations. There were significant inverse correlations between the HLA prognostic score and the annual decrease in CD4+ T-cell counts prior to HAART (AD) (P < 0.05) and the amount of KRG and the AD (P < 0.01). From 1998, the HPs had been treated with HAART. Each of the two patients died without and with HAART regimen respectively. At present, 16 HPs have been alive with HAART. Among the 16 HPs, 12 and 4 are on HAART-plus-KRG and HAART only respectively. Eleven HPs including 2 HPs with G-to-A hypermutations had revealed resistance mutations. Ten and two HPs have shown poor adherence and incomplete viral suppres-sion on HAART respectively. Virological failure based on WHO guidelines was not observed on KRG-plus-HAART. Two HPs revealed additional resistance mutations against two classes on KRG-plus-HAART. As a nationwide study, we first report overall features on clinical course of Korean haemophiliacs.

Three hundred HIV-infected men and women were included in this survey. The patients answered a standardized questionnaire, and vaccination cards were checked in order to assess hepatitis B vaccine status. A blood sample was collected for quantitative determination of antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). Participants were also evaluated for their CD4 cell count and HIV viral load. The overall vaccination coverage of HBV vaccination found in this study (57.4%) was lower than that was previously reported in South Brazil. Anti-HBs levels >10IU/L were observed in 47.0% of the studied population. A significant inequality in the coverage rates and antibody reactivity was found in favor of patients with better economic status. In conclusion, the results indicate the need for improvement in the HBV vaccination coverage among HIV carriers, in particular focusing on low-income individuals. "

After classification of vaccinees as non-responders (HBsAb <10IU/L) or responders (HBsAb >or=10IU/L) in our HIV cohort, multivariate logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with subsequent vaccine response. Of 626 participants vaccinated from 1988 to 2005, 217 (35%) were vaccine responders. Receipt of >or=3 doses of vaccine (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.24-2.70), higher CD4 count at vaccination (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.13 per 50 cells/microl increase), and use of HAART (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.56-3.62) were all associated with increased likelihood of developing a response. However, only 49% of those on HAART at last vaccination responded, and 62% of those on HAART, with CD4 count >or=350, and HIV RNA <400 copies/mL responded. Compared to those on HAART with CD4 count >or=350, those not on HAART with CD4 count >or=350 had significantly reduced odds of developing a vaccine response (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.70). While HAART use concurrent with HBV immunization was associated with increased probability of responding to the vaccine, the response rate was low for those on HAART. These data provide additional evidence of HAART benefits, even in those with higher CD4 counts, but also highlight the need for improving HBV vaccine immunogenicity."
2200,0.002,2.0,"Progression of HIV/AIDS is frequently associated with frontal/subcortical dysfunction and mean reaction time (RT) slowing. Beyond group means, within-subject variability of RT has been found to be particularly sensitive to frontal/subcortical dysfunction in other populations. However, the possible relevance of RT variability to HIV/AIDS patients remains unknown. This study evaluated the relationships between RT variability and indicators such as neurocognitive, behavioral, and immunological status. A total of 46 HIV-positive adults on antiretroviral medication regimens were included in this study. Overall performance of this sample was poorer than normative means on measures of RT latency, RT variability, and traditional neurocognitive domains. Results demonstrated that the measures of RT variability were associated with global cognition, medication adherence rates, and peak immunological dysfunction, above and beyond the effects of RT latency. These preliminary findings suggest that measures of RT variability may provide enhanced sensitivity to neurocognitive disease burden in HIV/AIDS relative to more traditional measures of mean RT or cognitive function."

In this study, serum samples from 100 individuals with HIV infection were tested for granulocyte antibodies (red cell antibodies, lymphocytotoxic antibodies, circulating immune complexes, and serum immunoglobulin G levels) by granulocyte agglutination (GA) and granulocyte immunofluorescence (GIF) assays. Granulocyte antibodies were detected in 66% of serum samples by GIF and in 21% of serum samples by GA. None of the positive sera reacted with granulocyte antigens of known specificity. Antibodies that reacted with red cell antigens other than ABO were detected in only three serum samples, but lymphocytotoxic antibodies were detected in 62% of patients. All serum samples were tested by immunoblotting with granulocyte plasma membranes. Only two samples were found to be positive; one sample reacted with a 58 kd protein and one reacted with a 55 kd protein, but neither serum sample immunoprecipitated any protein from granulocytes that were labeled at the cell surface with iodine 125. Since immune complexes that are bound to granulocyte membranes can be detected by GIF, circulating immune complex levels were measured in all 100 samples.

Long-term survival is increasing for HIV patients because of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, the chronic hepatitis B infection may become an important determinant of disease outcome in these co-infected patients. We describe two HIV/HBV co-infected patients who were treated with extended antiviral therapy, initially indicated for the HIV infection. Lamivudine, a suppressor of viral replication in both infections, was one of these antiviral drugs. One patient showed a severe rebound of the HBV after withdrawal of lamivudine, the other patient developed a mutant hepatitis B virus after 18 months of treatment. This mutation was exclusively induced by lamivudine. These patients show that, with improved HIV-related survival, the HBV infection should be monitored carefully, thereby enabling the physician to interfere with therapy when necessary."
6944,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes show a distinctive geographical distribution worldwide and genotypes A, D, and E are the most frequently found in Africa. There are only limited studies on HBV genotype distribution in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), all done in the western part showing a vast majority of genotype E. In our study, HBV strains from South Kivu, an eastern province of the DRC, were analyzed. Sequencing of 41 serum samples from HBV infected patients revealed strains of genotype A in 40/41 (97.6%) and genotype E in 1/41 (2.4%). The phylogenetic analysis showed that nearly all genotypes A (38/40) were closely related to A1 subgenotype strains found in Rwanda, Haiti, and Martinique while only two strains attached to the A2 subgenotype cluster were isolated. The remaining genotype E case was linked to the western African E crescent. Only the I169T nucleotide substitution was observed in two genotype A samples. In conclusion, the genotype A seems to be the most predominant genotype in eastern DRC with the majority belonging to the Afro-Asian subgenotype (A1). This contrasts with the western part of DRC where genotype E is predominant. These results support the hypothesis of an East-West genotypic demarcation."
3723,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may cause acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B (CHB), liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanisms by which HBV evades host immunity and maintains chronic infection are largely unknown. Here, we revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) is activated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HBV-infected patients, and HBV stimulates MMP-9 expression in macrophages and PBMCs isolated from healthy individuals. MMP-9 plays important roles in the breakdown of the extracellular matrix and in the facilitation of tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. MMP-9 also regulates respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication, but the mechanism underlying such regulation is unknown. We further demonstrated that MMP-9 facilitates HBV replication by repressing the interferon (IFN)/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, IFN action, STAT1/2 phosphorylation, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Moreover, MMP-9 binds to type I IFN receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and facilitates IFNAR1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, subcellular distribution, and degradation to interfere with the binding of IFANR1 to IFN-α. Thus, we identified a novel positive-feedback regulation loop between HBV replication and MMP-9 production. On one hand, HBV activates MMP-9 in infected patients and leukocytes. On the other hand, MMP-9 facilitates HBV replication through repressing IFN/JAK/STAT signaling, IFNAR1 function, and IFN-α action. Therefore, HBV may take the advantage of MMP-9 function to establish or maintain chronic infection."
2520,0.002,2.0,"Interferon-α (IFN-α)-based therapy is presently the standard treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. Despite good effectiveness, this cytokine is associated with major side effects, including significant lymphopenia, that limits its use for HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) has recently shown therapeutic potential and safety in several clinical trials designed to demonstrate T-cell restoration in immunodeficient patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus macaques, the relevance of IL-7 therapy as a means to overcoming IFN-α-induced lymphopenia. We showed that low-dose IFN-α treatment induced strong lymphopenia in chronically infected monkeys. In contrast, high-dose IFN-α treatment stimulated IL-7 production, leading to increased circulating T-cell counts. Moreover, IL-7 therapy more than abrogated the lymphopenic effect of low-dose IFN-α. Indeed, the association of both cytokines resulted in increased circulating T-cell counts, in particular in the naive compartments, as a consequence of central and peripheral homeostatic functions of the IL-7. Finally, reduced PD-1 expression by memory CD8(+) T cells and transient T-cell repertoire diversification were observed under IL-7 therapy. Our data strongly suggest that IL-7 immunotherapy will be of substantial benefit in the treatment of HIV/HCV coinfection and should enhance the likelihood of HCV eradication in poorly responding patients."
3262,0.002,2.0,"We studied the lymphoid tissue biopsies of 20 patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by analyzing collagen deposition, CD4+ cell number, and gene expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs; MMP-2, MMP-9) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs; TIMP-1, TIMP-2). HIV-infected patients had significantly increased collagen deposition (P = .001), fewer CD4+ T cells (P = .05), and decreased MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios (P = .01), compared with HIV-negative control patients. Moreover, we found a significant negative correlation between collagen deposition and the MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio (ρ = -0.50; P = .047). To our knowledge, this is the first time that MMP/TIMP imbalance has been correlated with lymphoid tissue collagen deposition and incomplete immune recovery in HIV-infected patients, even after long-term antiretroviral treatment."

We analyzed the HBV DNA pre-C region in five members of a Turkish family. The mother presented an anti-HBe (+) CAH-B and the four children different hepatitis B virus serological and clinical profiles. The pre-C region was analyzed by cloning after DNA amplification in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A method for rapid screening of a large number of cloned polymerase chain reaction products was developed for the presence of the most frequent pre-C mutations (G to A substitution at nucleotide position 1896 and 1899). At least 60 independent clones were tested for each patient by selective oligonucleotide hybridization using non-mutated (M0), one (M1) and two (M2) point-mutated probes. Results were confirmed by sequencing. The mutation 1896 was present in 91% of DNA clones from the mother. The same mutation was also found in 85% of the clones in the youngest child (D), but in less than 10% of the clones from children A and C. Only the pre-C wild-type strain was observed in child B. X gene deletions (3 to 20 nt) were also present in some clones from the mother and children A, B and C. No significant difference between serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells concerning the viral population was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6604,0.002,2.0,"Resistance to HIV-1 infection in Europeans is associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for the CCR5 protein that is present in Th2 cells and serves as a coreceptor for HIV-1 R5 strain. A deletion of 32 amino acids from the cytokine receptor prevents infection. This mutation prevails in Europeans and is absent in Africans. However, duplication of a gene that codes for a chemokine that binds to the CCR5 was discovered in Africans (mean gene copy 6 while in non-Africans the mean gene copy is 3). Higher expression of these genes protects T cells against HIV-1 infection in vitro. It should be noted that resistance to HIV-1 R5 variant does not protect against HIV-1 R4 variant. It was reported that a minority of highly HIV-1 exposed African professional sex workers (APSW) were resistant to the virus infection during a 10 years period. Recently, the analysis of the cytokines in the serum of the persistently infected seronegative women revealed that the latter hypo-expresses the cytokine IL-4. Since the molecular events during HIV-1 infection are associated with a marked increase in the levels of IL-4 and IgE in the sera of the infected individuals, it suggests that AIDS is an allergy. Thus, a very low level of IL-4 production may abrogate the virus infection. Studies on the human IL-4 gene revealed that together with the IL-4 mRNA a spliced variant with a deletion of exon 2 is synthesized. The latter is a natural antagonist of IL-4 and when expressed in an individual at a level higher than IL-4, the person will resist a microbial infection (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) or asthma. The present hypothesis suggests that the HIV-1 resistant APSWs produce more IL-4 delta 2 molecules than IL-4 molecules. The binding of IL-4 delta 2 to IL-4 receptors on T and B cells prevents their functions and the infection by HIV-1. The implications of these studies are that treatment of HIV-1 infected people with drugs that will block the IL-4 receptors will stop HIV-1 infections and the determination of the levels of IL-4 and IL-4 delta 2 in the sera of HIV-1+ patients will enable to identify the individuals that have a natural resistance to HIV-l/AIDS and those who need treatments."

Serum samples from 250, injecting drug users (IDUs) from a de-addiction centre were screened for HBsAg using immunochromatography, anti HCV antibody by 3rd generation ELISA test and anti HIV antibody by ELISA test and immunochromatographic rapid test during the period August to October 2002. One hundred and forty-nine (59.6%) IDUs were positive for HIV antibody, 226 (90.4%) were positive for anti HCV antibody and 27 (10.8%) were positive for HBsAg. There was co-infection of HIV, HBV and HCV in 15 (6%) of the IDUs. The Co-infection of HBV and HCV were found in 12 cases (4.8%) and Co-infection of HIV and HCV was found in 131 cases (52.4%). The IDUs were in sexually active age group with a risk of infection to their sexual partner. There is high prevalence of HCV and HIV infection and co-infection of both viruses among IDUs. Comprehensive public health interventions targeting this population and their sexual partners must be encouraged.

Surveillance databases including persons reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with HIV, HBV, and HCV by 31 December 2010 and not known to be dead as of 1 January 2000, were matched with 2000-2011 vital statistics mortality data. Of 140 606 persons reported with HIV, 4% were co-infected with HBV only, 15% were co-infected with HCV only, and 1% were co-infected with HBV and HCV. In all groups, 70-80% were male. The most common race/ethnicity and HIV transmission risk groups were non-Hispanic blacks and men who have sex with men (MSM) for HIV/HBV infection, and non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and injection drug users for HIV/HCV and HIV/HBV/HCV infections. The overall age-adjusted 2000-2011 mortality was higher in co-infected than HIV mono-infected individuals. Use of population-based surveillance data provided a comprehensive characterization of HIV co-infection with HBV and HCV. Our findings emphasize the importance of targeting HIV and viral hepatitis testing and prevention efforts to populations at risk for co-infection, and of integrating HIV and viral hepatitis care and testing services."
3636,0.002,2.0,"Deficiency in antioxidant micronutrients have been observed in patients with AIDS. These observations concerning only some isolated nutrients demonstrate a defect in zinc, selenium, and glutathione. An increase in free radical production and lipid peroxidation has been also found in these patients, and takes a great importance with recent papers presenting an immunodeficiency and more important an increase in HIV-1 replication secondary to free radicals overproduction. We have assessed different studies, trying to obtain a global view of the antioxidant status of these patients. In adults we observe a progressive decrease for zinc, selenium, and vitamin E with the severity of disease, except that selenium remains normal at stage II. However, the main dramatic decrease concerns carotenoids whose level at stage II is only half the normal value. To understand if these decreases in antioxidant and increases in oxidative stress occur secondary to the aggravation of the disease or, conversely, are responsible for it, we undertook a longitudinal survey of asymptotic patients. The preliminary results of this evaluation are presented. Paradoxically, lipid peroxidation is higher at stage II than at stage IV. This may be consecutive to a more intense overproduction of oxygen free radicals by more viable polymorphonuclear (PMN) at the asymptomatic stage. The free radicals production and lipid peroxidation seem secondary to a direct induction by the virus of PMN stimulation and cytokines secretion. N-Acetyl cysteine or ascorbate have been demonstrated in cell culture to be capable of blocking the expression of HIV-1 after oxidative stress and N-acetyl cysteine inhibits in vitro TNF-induced apoptosis of infected cells. In regard to all these experimental data, few serious and large trials of antioxidants have been conducted in HIV-infected patients, although some preliminary studies using zinc or selenium have been performed. In our opinion it is now time to evaluate in humans the beneficial effect of antioxidants. The more promising candidates for presenting synergistic effects when associated with N-acetyl cysteine seem to be beta-carotene, selenium and zinc."
466,0.002,2.0,"Replication competent recombinant simian-human immunodeficiency virus encoding the reverse transcriptase gene (RT SHIV) from HIV-1 was characterized for vaginal transmission in rhesus macaques. RT SHIV was shown to transmit efficiently via the vaginal route in macaques with detectable plasma viremia persisting for a year in some animals. Analyses of virus load in tissues of infected animals revealed accumulation of viral RNA in lymph nodes and spleen with levels correlating with plasma viremia. RT-SHIV was inhibited by dapivirine, nevirapine, efavirenz and tenofovir in vitro, although the effect was less pronounced with tenofovir. Virus isolated from infected animals at early and later time points had limited changes in RT sequences and exhibited similar sensitivity to RT inhibitors as the challenge virus. The vaginal transmission of RT SHIV demonstrated here suggests this virus may possibly be used in the nonhuman primate model for limited evaluation of RT inhibitors applied vaginally."
6907,0.002,2.0,"Since 1987 we started to treat all vertically HIV-1 infected newborns by an antiretroviral therapy as soon as the diagnosis was confirmed. From the study of 55 HIV-1 infected children followed at Armand Trousseau Hospital (Paris, France) we retrospectively evaluated the use of the plasma viral load as a marker of the treatment efficiency. This parameter and CD4 counts were measured the day of any modification in antiviral therapy (Day 0), 1 and 3 months later (M1 and M3) and every 3 months as long as possible. In the 3 groups of treatment modifications a decrease in plasma viral load was observed. A statistically significant increase in CD4 counts was only observed in the group treated with the association of 2 nucleoside analogues and 1 proteinase inhibitor. This group demonstrated the most important decrease in plasma viral load (> 0.7 log 10 Eq Cop/ml). This leads us to propose to the ""ANRS"" a protocol study for the treatment of all vertically HIV-1 infected children by the association of 3 nucleoside analogues and 1 proteinase inhibitor as early as 8 weeks post natal when the HIV infection is confirmed."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the Health Enlightenment, Awareness and Living Intervention, designed to decrease HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and related risky behaviors. The thirteen-session intervention was implemented among homeless and formerly incarcerated low-income African American women, ages 18 to 55, in Atlanta, Georgia from 2006 to 2010. A single group repeated measures study design was employed and consisted of a pre-test (n = 355) group, an immediate post-test (n = 228) group with a response rate of 64%, and a six-month follow up (n = 110) group with response rate of 48%, completing a 135-item survey. Paired-sample t-tests, McNemar tests, and repeated measures ANOVA were applied to compare survey results. Participants demonstrated statistically significant increases in hepatitis B and C knowledge over time (p < 0.001). Statistically significant decreases were also reported for unprotected sex in exchange for money, drugs or shelter (p = 0.008), and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol (p < 0.001). Reported substance use decreased with statistical significance for alcohol (p = 0.011), marijuana (p = 0.011), illegal drugs (p = 0.002), and crack/cocaine (p = 0.003).

Two hundred outpatients from a specialized clinic for HIV-care located in Walter Cantídio's University Hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil answered to a demographic questionnaire, the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and a sexual behavior questionnaire based on WHO's Behavioral Surveillance Surveys (BSS). Fifteen percent (N=30) of all HIV positive patients were MDQ+. The MDQ+ group was more likely to: be or have been married, have offspring, have sex with commercial and non-regular partners, have infrequent condom use with non-regular partners and of not have used condom in their first sex. Despite more sexual practices among MDQ+ patients before HIV diagnosis, these patients had a more significant reduction of all behaviors after HIV diagnosis than the MDQ- group."
476,0.002,2.0,"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses peak coincident with the decline in acute HIV viremia. Despite two reports of CTL-resistant HIV variants emerging during acute infection, the contribution of acute CTL escape to HIV pathogenesis remains unclear. Difficulties inherent in studying acute HIV infection can be overcome by modeling virus-host interactions in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. We sequenced 21 complete simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac239 genomes at four weeks post-infection to determine the extent of acute CTL escape. Here we show that viruses from 19 of 21 macaques escaped from CTLs during acute infection and that these escape-selecting CTLs were responsive to lower concentrations of peptide than other SIV-specific CTLs. Interestingly, CTLs that require low peptide concentrations for stimulation (high 'functional avidity') are particularly effective at controlling other viral infections. Our results suggest that acute viral escape from CTLs is a hallmark of SIV infection and that CTLs with high functional avidity can rapidly select for escape variants."
6966,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) expresses two structural forms of the nucleoprotein, the intracellular nucleocapsid (hepatitis core antigen [HBcAg]) and the secreted nonparticulate form (hepatitis e antigen [HBeAg]). The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific genetic immunogens to induce HBc/HBeAg-specific CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell immune responses and the potential to induce liver injury in HBV-transgenic (Tg) mice. Both the HBcAg- and HBeAg-specific plasmids primed comparable immune responses. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were important for priming/effector functions of HBc/HBeAg-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, a unique two-step immunization protocol was necessary to elicit maximal CTL priming. Genetic vaccination did not prime CTLs in HBe- or HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice but elicited a weak CTL response in HBcAg-Tg mice. When HBc/HBeAg-specific CTLs were adoptively transferred into HBc-, HBe-, and HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice, the durations of the liver injury and inflammation were significantly greater in HBeAg-Tg recipient mice than in HBcAg-Tg mice. Importantly, liver injury in HBc/HBeAg-dbl-Tg mice was similar to the injury observed in HBeAg-Tg mice. Loss of HBeAg synthesis commonly occurs during chronic HBV infection; however, the mechanism of selection of HBeAg-negative variants is unknown. The finding that hepatocytes expressing wild-type HBV (containing both HBcAg and HBeAg) are more susceptible to CTL-mediated clearance than hepatocytes expressing only HBcAg suggest that the HBeAg-negative variant may have a selective advantage over wild-type HBV within the livers of patients with chronic infection during an immune response and may represent a CTL escape mutant."
485,0.002,2.0,"There is a continuing search for better ways to use existing drugs against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). One idea is to use short therapy interruptions to ""autovaccinate"" HIV-infected patients. A group of 13 chronically HIV-infected patients enrolled in a trial of such so-called structured treatment interruptions (STIs) were intensively studied with respect to their viral load (VL) and HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte [CTL]) responses. We found that 10 of the 13 patients had plateau VLs after STIs that were lower than their pretreatment VLs. While viral rebound rates became lower over STIs, there were no changes in clearance rates. Although numbers of CTLs did increase over the same time that viral rebounds decreased, there was no correlation between CTL count and either viral rebound rates or clearance rates. Finally, we asked whether absolute numbers of or changes in numbers of CTLs predict plateau VLs after STIs. No measure of CTLs was able to predict plateau VLs. Thus, there was no signature in these data of an important contribution to virological control from HIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes."
1184,0.002,2.0,"Most patients failing antiretroviral treatment in Uganda continue to fail their treatment regimen even if a dominant drug-resistant HIV-1 genotype is not detected. In a recent retrospective study, we observed that approximately 30% of HIV-infected individuals in the Joint Clinical Research Centre (Kampala, Uganda) experienced virologic failure with a susceptible HIV-1 genotype based on standard Sanger sequencing. Selection of minority drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (not detectable by Sanger sequencing) under antiretroviral therapy pressure can lead to a shift in the viral quasispecies distribution, becoming dominant members of the virus population and eventually causing treatment failure. Here, we used a novel HIV-1 genotyping assay based on deep sequencing (DeepGen) to quantify low-level drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in 33 patients failing a first-line antiretroviral treatment regimen in the absence of drug-resistant mutations, as screened by standard population-based Sanger sequencing. Using this sensitive assay, we observed that 64% (21/33) of these individuals had low-frequency (or minority) drug-resistant variants in the intrapatient HIV-1 population, which correlated with treatment failure. Moreover, the presence of these minority HIV-1 variants was associated with higher intrapatient HIV-1 diversity, suggesting a dynamic selection or fading of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants from the viral quasispecies in the presence or absence of drug pressure, respectively. This study identified low-frequency HIV drug resistance mutations by deep sequencing in Ugandan patients failing antiretroviral treatment but lacking dominant drug resistance mutations as determined by Sanger sequencing methods. We showed that these low-abundance drug-resistant viruses could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes, especially if treatment is not modified based on a susceptible HIV-1 genotype by Sanger sequencing. Therefore, we propose to make clinical decisions using more sensitive methods to detect minority HIV-1 variants."

However, the cost and workload of routine HLA-B*5701 pretreatment screening is relatively heavy. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of the HLA-B*5701 allele in the HIV-positive population under care in Hong Kong. Blood samples from 1264 HIV-1 infected patients in Hong Kong were collected between 2007 and 2011 for this study. HLA-B*5701 screening of the study group was determined by in-house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by confirmation using the AlleleSEQR(®) HLA-B PCR/Sequencing Kit (Celera Corporation for Abbott, San Francisco, USA). HLA-B*5701 carriers were identified among 3% of Caucasians, 1% of non-Chinese Asians and 0.5% of Han-Chinese in Hong Kong. Our findings revealed that HLA-B*5701 pretreatment screening might not be necessary for the local Han-Chinese population due to its low prevalence. "

The complete national register of HIV and AIDS cases reported to the Department of Epidemiology at the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control 1996-2002 was searched for cases diagnosed with HIV less than three months before AIDS diagnosis (so-called ""late testers""). Of a total of 487 patients with AIDS, reported during the seven-year period, 219 (45%) were late testers. Their proportion of all AIDS cases increased from 22% in 1996 to 58% in 2002. Heterosexual route of transmission, age greater than 40 years, and foreign origin were all significant risk factors for being a late tester. Intravenous drug users were associated with a highly significant reduced risk. The group without previously known HIV infection represents an increasing part of all cases of AIDS. From a disease control and from a medical perspective, it is important to study this group further and discover what measures are needed for earlier identification and access to medical care."

This cross-sectional study explored social and psychosocial factors associated with adherence among adolescents with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in Panama from a gender perspective. A questionnaire developed for the study was applied to 38 adolescent patients (20 female, 18 male; median age, 14 years). Thirty-two patients (86%; one missing response) still depended on an adult to remember taking their medication, among whom 28 relied on a female relative. Although 18 (47%) patients reported to become ill no more than once a year, only 10 (26%) patients showed an undetectable viral load, and 4 (11%) patients showed no CD4 suppression. Seventeen (45%) patients recalled correctly their medication. During the week prior to the interview, 26 patients (68%) reported that they had missed at least one dose. When asked the reason for missing a dose, 23 out of 34 (68%; 4 missing responses) patients responded, ""I forgot"". Female patients gave more excuses for missing doses (mean ± SD number of excuses per female, 2.4 ± 2; per male, 1.2 ± 1; p = .02), while more male than female patients described an action plan if they ran out of medication (13 vs. 8; p = .05).

We studied 39 patients who received ADV added to lamivudine for breakthrough hepatitis. We determined early viral changes (12 weeks) in YMDD mutants (rtM204I [YIDD sequence], rtM204V [YVDD]) and rtL180M in all 39 patients as well as amino acid changes in the polymerase reverse transcriptase (rt) region and precore/core promoter mutations in 15 patients who received long-term treatment (more than 1 year). Changes in rtM204I and rtL180M viral loads were greater than that of the rtM204V, albeit statistically insignificant. Moreover, the greatest change in viral load was seen for rtM204I without hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The precore mutant was replaced with wild-type virus in three of eight patients after 1 year of added ADV therapy. Compared to baseline with lamivudine therapy only, new amino acid mutations were seen in the rt region at baseline with ADV in seven patients. At 1 year after ADV coadministration, the YMDD motif was replaced with wild-type (rt204M) in two patients, in whom mutations were fewer and of a different type. We conclude that the rtM204I may be more sensitive to ADV in vivo. ADV tended to select wild-type virus from precore mutants. Moreover, viruses that were wild-type in the rt region reappeared after 1 year of ADV coadministration in some patients."

3886,0.002,2.0,"Low-level viremia due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) was demonstrated in the sera of two patients diagnosed previously as having non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis. Both patients had a ""silent"" HBV infection, because they were negative for both hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis B core antibody. The TaqMan chemistry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the HBV DNA, enabling quantitation of the virus in their sera. Their serum HBV DNA concentrations were low: the amount of each HBV S or X gene amplified showed there were approximately 10(3) copies/ml and HBV DNA was detected occasionally during clinical follow-up. Positive HBsAg staining in liver tissues was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. Vertical transmission of silent HBV from one patient to her daughter was confirmed. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified HBV X region revealed several mutations, suggesting reduced viral replication. One patient had a T-to-C mutation at the extreme 5'-terminus of the direct repeat 2 region and the other exhibited a coexisting X region with a 155-nucleotide deletion. These findings suggest that HBV replication is suppressed considerably in patients with silent hepatitis B."

Resistant virus showed VCV-enhanced replication, cross-resistance to another CCR5 antagonist, TAK779, and increased sensitivity to aminooxypentane-RANTES and the CCR5 monoclonal antibody HGS004. Pretreatment V3 loop sequences reemerged following VCV discontinuation, implying that VCV resistance has associated fitness costs."
4364,0.002,2.0,"Virologic failure on continuous antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with variable changes in CD4 T-cell counts: peripheral CD4 T-cell counts decrease in conjunction with a resurgence of plasma virus (nonresponders) or remain stable or continue to increase despite ongoing virus replication (discordant responders). This study found that HIV-1 isolated from nonresponders had significantly greater replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as an enhanced ability to induce apoptosis in both HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected CD4 T cells compared with virus isolated from discordant responders. Enhanced replicative capacity in PBMCs of virus isolated from nonresponders was inhibited by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Virus quasispecies isolated from PBMCs from nonresponders used both CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and CX chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) for entry, in contrast to virus isolated from PBMCs from discordant responders, which predominantly used CCR5. In contrast, virus isolated from plasma from both groups predominantly used CCR5. In summary, although drug resistance may lead to impaired viral fitness, the capacity of virus quasispecies from PBMCs to use CXCR4 may have significant consequences on viral replicative capacity and potentially on clinical outcome."
5268,0.002,2.0,"We evaluated prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among prison inmates in France in 2010, in a cross-sectional single-day study based on a two-stage design. Sampling favoured larger establishments and included all types of prisons. Establishments were stratified by geographical region. Estimates were adjusted by post-stratification of the total population of inmates in France. From 60,975 inmates in all 188 prisons on the sampling day, 2,154 were selected from 27 prisons, and 1,876 questionnaires completed. HIV prevalence was estimated at 2.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9–4.2), 2.6% (95% CI: 0.7–8.8) in women and 2.0% (95% CI: 0.9–4.3) in men; 75% of inmates were receiving treatment for HIV. HCV prevalence was estimated at 4.8% (95% CI: 3.5–6.5) and was higher for women (11.8%; 95% CI: 8.5–16.1) than men (4.5%; 95% CI: 3.3–6.3). Almost half of HCV-infected inmates had chronic hepatitis C and 44% were receiving or had received treatment. HIV and HCV prevalence was six times higher than in the general population, and 2.5% of inmates had viraemic hepatitis C. The moment of incarceration provides an ideal opportunity for testing and treating, limiting spread of HCV and improving patients' prognosis."
1111,0.002,2.0,"In the United States, approximately one in three new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are transmitted via heterosexual contact. To monitor HIV risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among heterosexuals and other populations, CDC surveys persons in selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), using the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS). This report summarizes data collected from heterosexuals in 24 MSAs with a high prevalence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) that participated in NHBS during 2006-2007. Of 14,837 heterosexuals aged 18-50 years who were interviewed and tested, 2.0% were HIV infected. HIV prevalence was higher among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). For example, HIV prevalence was 2.8% among participants with less than a high school education compared with 1.2% among those with more than a high school education, 2.6% among participants who were unemployed compared with 1.0% among those who were employed, and 2.3% among participants with annual household incomes at or below the poverty level compared with 1.0% among those with incomes above the poverty level. This association between HIV prevalence and SES could not be attributed to factors commonly associated with HIV infection risk in heterosexuals, such as using crack cocaine, exchanging sex for things such as money or drugs, or being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Based on the association observed between HIV prevalence and SES, HIV prevention activities targeted at heterosexuals in urban areas with high AIDS prevalence should be focused on those with lower SES."
3891,0.002,2.0,"To examine the relationship between latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression, two studies were done among a cohort of HIV-infected injecting drug users. First, the decline in CD4 cell count after baseline tuberculin skin testing was prospectively compared for 37 tuberculin-positive (induration > or = 5 mm) and 284 tuberculin-negative (induration < or = 2 mm) persons. After adjustment for baseline immune function, the mean 6-month CD4 cell decline was not significantly different (34.5 vs. 45.6 cells, respectively, P = .14). Second, the plasma HIV burden at baseline skin testing was compared for 33 tuberculin-positive cases and 33 matched tuberculin-negative controls. HIV RNA was detected in 8 cases and 10 controls (odds ratio = 0.67, 95% confidence interval = 0.19-2.36). Among the 14 pairs with HIV detected in > or = 1 member, the HIV concentration was higher for the case in 4 and for the control in 10 (P = .18). These findings suggest that unlike active tuberculosis, latent M. tuberculosis infection does not hasten HIV progression."
7734,0.002,2.0,"Cancers associated with immunosuppression and infections have long been recognized as a major complication of HIV/AIDS. More recently, persons living with HIV are increasingly diagnosed with a wider spectrum of HIV-associated malignancies (HIVAM) as they live longer on combination antiretroviral therapy. This has spurred research to characterize the epidemiology and determine the optimal management of HIVAM with a focus on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given background coinfections, environmental exposures, host genetic profiles, antiretroviral therapy usage, and varying capacities for early diagnosis and treatment, one can expect the biology of cancers in HIV-infected persons in LMICs to have a significant impact on chronic HIV care, as is now the case in high-income countries. Thus, new strategies must be developed to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat HIVAM in LMICs; provide physical/clinical infrastructures; train the cancer and HIV workforce; and expand research capacity-particularly given the challenges posed by the limitations on available transportation and financial resources and the population's general rural concentration. Opportunities exist to extend resources supported by the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to improve the health-care infrastructure and train the personnel required to prevent and manage cancers in persons living with HIV. These HIV chronic care infrastructures could also serve cancer patients regardless of their HIV status, facilitating long-term care and treatment for persons who do not live near cancer centers, so that they receive the same degree of care as those receiving chronic HIV care today."
1800,0.002,2.0,"The number of older people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the UK is rising. Older people are at risk of acquiring HIV infection for a multitude of reasons. This, combined with effective HIV treatment which has significantly prolonged life expectancy, means that health care professionals working in the UK can expect to see increasing numbers of older people with HIV infection. In this review article, we summarise the epidemiology of HIV amongst older people, including data from our local cohort in the city of Sheffield, UK. We discuss specific and practical issues in older patients including why older people are at risk, how to make a diagnosis and the importance of doing so early, guidelines for HIV testing and an update on anti-retroviral therapy including drug interactions and side effects."
9242,0.002,2.0,"Antiretroviral medications are effective at improving the health and increasing the survival of people living with HIV/AIDS. However, studies have shown that a substantial number of HIV-infected people do not receive antiretroviral treatments. The current study examined the physical and mental health, substance use, and perceptions of medical care of 163 men and 78 women living with HIV/AIDS. Results of a confidential survey showed that 79 (33%) were not currently treated for HIV. These persons did not differ from those who were treated in chart-abstracted CD4 cell counts, years living with HIV infection, HIV-related symptoms, and HIV-related hospitalizations. Unlike past studies, gender was not found to be a factor in treatment status. However, untreated persons had higher chart-abstracted viral loads and were more likely to be ethnic minorities, have a lower level of education, greater level of depression, and greater pessimistic attitude. They were significantly more likely to have used alcohol, powder cocaine, and crack cocaine in the previous 3 months, were likely to know their own viral load and CD4 count, and held significantly more negative views of their health care and their health care providers. There were no differences between untreated and treated persons in their meeting the year 1999 antiretroviral treatment guidelines that were in effect at the time of data collection. These results suggest that persons who are not receiving antiretroviral medications may be in need of mental health and substance use interventions and may benefit from interventions designed to engage and retain them in medical treatment."
4424,0.002,2.0,"We investigated the effectiveness of the Japanese health care system for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS), in terms of prevention, diagnosis, access to antiretroviral treatment, and treatment outcomes. Clinical information on HIV/AIDS cases was collected via questionnaires sent to 377 registered HIV/AIDS clinics in Japan. Data on 9,040 and 14,569 cases were collected in 2009 and 2014, respectively. The percentages of cases undergoing treatment were 69.6% and 87.8% in 2009 and 2014, respectively, demonstrating an improvement in treatment coverage over the 5 years between the 2 surveys. The proportion of cases with undetectable HIV RNA in the 2014 survey was 87.7%. Thus, our survey revealed that the 2 of the United Nations AIDS Fast-Track targets, 90% treated and 90% virally suppressed, are close to being achieved. However, Japan appears to have fallen short of the upstream target of 90% diagnosed. Japan needs to radically reform its strategies for encouraging people to undergo HIV testing and to develop a system for estimating the number of people living with HIV."
5147,0.002,2.0,"Since the first case of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was reported in 1981, AIDS has always been a global health threat and the leading cause of deaths due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistance and unwanted metabolic side effects. Every day in 2007 an estimated 6850 people were newly infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Over the past 28 years the rapid worldwide spread of AIDS has prompted an intense research effort to discover compounds that could effectively inhibit HIV. The development of new, selective and safe inhibitors for the treatment of HIV, therefore, still remains a high priority for medical research. To the best of our knowledge, the indole derivatives have been considered as one class of promising HIV-1 inhibitors, such as delavirdine approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997 for use in combination with other antiretrovirals in adults with HIV infection. In this review we focus on the synthesis and anti-HIV-1 activity of indole derivatives, in the meantime, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) for some derivatives are also surveyed. It will pave the way for the design of indole derivatives as anti-HIV-1 drugs in the future."
9527,0.002,2.0,"Multiple human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences with deletions of NF-kappaB binding sites at both the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTRs) were identified in serial samples collected from an infected individual. The effect of this deletion on the level of transcription was studied by transient transfection of an LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene and by infection with a full-length recombinant HIV-1 containing a luciferase reporter (HIVHXBluc). Detectable levels of gene expression were found in both systems, in the presence or absence of the viral transactivator Tat. Interestingly, a duplication of a putative TCF-1alpha motif was found in place of the NF-kappaB elements in these viruses. Higher transcriptional activity was observed with HXBLTR (NF-kappaB intact) than with the patient's LTR (NF-kappaB deleted), suggesting that the NF-kappaB binding sites may promote optimal levels of viral gene transcription. The ability of these viruses with NF-kappaB deleted to replicate and cause substantial decline in CD4 cell counts demonstrates that the NF-kappaB binding sites are not absolutely required for viral replication or pathogenicity in vivo. These results are consistent with the notion that the HIV-1 LTR possesses functional redundancy which allows it to interact with multiple transcription factors, thereby ensuring viral replication in a variety of cell types."
4780,0.002,2.0,"Occult hepatitis B (OHB) is characterized by the presence of HBV-DNA in the absence of HBsAg in the serum of patients. Hemodialysis patients are at high risk for hepatitis B virus and there are few data on the prevalence of OHB in this population, mainly in Brazil. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of OHB in patients undergoing hemodialysis. A cross-sectional study was performed, including 301 patients on chronic hemodialysis at two dialysis centers in São Luís (Maranhão), northeast Brazil. Serological tests were performed for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and anti-HCV using enzyme immunoassays (ELISA); HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA were studied by real-time PCR. The mean age was 49 ± 15 years, and 128 (42%) were female. Serological tests confirmed that all samples were HBsAg negative. Anti-HBc was positive in 114 (38%) patients, anti-HBc and anti-HBs were simultaneously positive in 104 (35%), and anti-HBc alone was positive in 10 (3%). Tests were negative for anti-HBc and anti-HBs in 55 patients (18%). Anti-HBs was the only positive marker in 132 (44%) patients. Anti-HCV was positive in 15 (5%) patients with HCV-RNA present in 14 of them (93%). HBV-DNA was positive in seven cases (2.3%). There was no association of HBV-DNA with age, gender, time on dialysis, previous kidney transplant, or HBV serological pattern, but there was a positive correlation with the presence of anti-HCV (P < 0.001). OHB in chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis appears to be a relevant finding, suggesting that studying HBV-DNA in this population using sensitive molecular tests should be a recommended course of action, especially in candidates for renal transplant."
8299,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of basal core promoter (BCP) and precore gene (PC) mutations in hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolates among the Nicobarese tribe and their relationship with genotypes and HBeAg status. A total of 726 blood samples were collected from two villages of the Car Nicobar Island where mass vaccination was performed in the year 2000. HBV DNA was isolated and the BCP and PC regions were amplified and sequenced directly. The samples positive for HBV DNA were tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and anti-HBe. Among the 211 and 515 samples collected from vaccinated and nonvaccinated persons, 16 and 82 were positive for HBV DNA, respectively. Among the vaccinated individuals, only 1 had a mutation in both the BCP and PC gene. Among the nonvaccinated subjects, 3 (4.5%) had an A1762T mutation, 8 (12.1%) had a G1764A mutation, 11 (16.7%) had a G1896A mutation and 4 (6.1%) had a G1899A mutation. The HBeAg-negative subjects had a significantly higher frequency of BCP and PC mutations than the HBeAg-positive subjects. The prevalence of a PC mutation was higher than that of a BCP mutation. The present study stresses the need for the continuous surveillance of subjects with BCP and PC mutations, as the mutations may contribute to the progression of liver disease."
1015,0.002,2.0,"Mortality among HIV-infected patients after the first year of antiretroviral therapy has not improved in recent years. Future improvement in survival may come partly through earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment and by maximizing treatment adherence. However, outcomes in HIV disease are also influenced today by long-term treatment toxicities, non-HIV-specific comorbid conditions, and comorbid behaviors. Primary care efforts to improve outcomes should be focused on health behaviors (eg, adherence, elimination of substance abuse, diet, and exercise) and effective management of conditions such as hypertension and depression, since successful intervention in these areas reduces risk of a variety of conditions associated with mortality in HIV disease. Issues in prioritizing primary care in HIV disease were discussed by Amy C. Justice, MD, PhD, at the 9th Annual Ryan White CARE Act Clinical Update in Washington, DC. The original presentation is available as a Webcast at www.iasusa.org."
6755,0.002,2.0,"The study aimed to clarify clinical significance of hepatitis B virus (HBV) rtA181S mutation in Chinese HBV-infected patients. A total of 18 419 patients with chronic HBV infection from Beijing 302 Hospital were investigated. HBV complete reverse transcriptase region of polymerase was screened by direct sequencing, and the results were verified by clonal sequencing. Replication-competent mutant and wild-type HBV genomic amplicons were constructed and transfected into the HepG2 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of serially diluted nucleos(t)ide analogues. Intracellular HBV replicative intermediates were quantitated for calculating the 50% effective concentration of the drug (EC(50)). The rtA181S was detected in 98 patients with 12 kinds of mutational patterns. Genotype C and genotype B HBV infection occupied 91.8% and 8.2% in rtA181S-positive patients, in contrast to 84.6% and 15.4% in rtA181S-negative patients (P < 0.01). All rtA181S-positive patients had received nucleos(t)ide analogues. rtA181S was detected in multiple patients with virologic breakthrough. Phenotypic analysis of patient-derived viral strains showed that rtA181S, rtA181S+N236T, rtN236T and rtA181V strains had 68.5%, 49.9%, 71.4% and 66.2% of natural replication capacity of wild-type strain, and 3.7-fold, 9.8-fold, 7.9-fold and 5.6-fold increased EC(50) to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). The rtA181S strain remained susceptible to lamivudine, entecavir and tenofovir, and ADV susceptibility was restored after the mutation was eliminated through site-directed mutagenesis. Rescue therapy with entecavir or combination therapy was effective in rtA181S-related ADV-refractory patients. The rtA181S mutation confers moderate resistance to ADV. It could be induced by either lamivudine or ADV and contribute ADV treatment failure."

In this study, complementary DNA microarray analysis was performed under immunodeficient conditions with human hepatocyte chimeric mice, and gene expression profiles were analyzed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and/or interferon treatment. The expression levels of 183 of 525 genes upregulated by interferon treatment were significantly suppressed in response to HBV infection. Suppressed genes were statistically significantly associated with the interferon signaling pathway and pattern recognition receptors in the bacteria/virus recognition pathway (P = 1.0 × 10(-8) and P = 1.2 × 10(-8), respectively). HBV infection attenuated virus recognition and interferon response in hepatocytes, which facilitated HBV escape from innate immunity."
3321,0.002,2.0,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is one of the important cytokine in generating an immune response against hepatitis B virus (HBV). Genetic polymorphisms might influence gene transcription, leading to disturbance in cytokine production. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in TNF-α gene could affect the pathogenesis of HBV. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of TNF-α polymorphism [-863C/A (rs1800630), -308G/A (rs1800629), -376G/A (rs1800750), -857C/T (rs1799724) and +489G/A (rs1800610)] in the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. Polymorphisms of the TNF-α (-863C/A (rs1800630), -308G/A) were analyzed by Polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primer (PCR-SSP) while TNF-α (-376G/A, -857C/T and +489G/A) by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 104 patients with CHB and 104 healthy controls. The plasma level of TNF-α was measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The study showed a significant increase in the frequency of -863CC, -376GA, -857CC, -857TT and +489GA genotypes and -863C, -376A, -857C, and +489A alleles in CHB patients compared to controls.

7810,0.002,2.0,"Previous studies have suggested the efficacy of foscarnet combined with thymidine analogues as salvage therapy in late-stage HIV-1 infection. Here, we report on the first case of foscarnet therapy in a patient infected with HIV-2 exhibiting virologic failure. The patient was known to be HIV-2-infected since 1992 and had received 11 sequential lines of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) with almost all the available antiretroviral agents including raltegravir. A marked decrease in HIV-2 plasma viral load of 1.48 log(10)copies/ml was observed at day 14 of foscarnet induction therapy associated with zidovudine and failing cART. An optimized cART was then introduced with lamivudine, zidovudine, lopinavir/r, etravirine and maraviroc. Four months after the end of foscarnet therapy, HIV-2 plasma viral load remained undetectable. This case report suggests that foscarnet may represent a therapeutic option for HIV-2-infected patients exhibiting multidrug resistance."

Of the 104 men who had experienced symptoms, 39% had consulted the general practitioner for HIV-related advice. A total of 49% of those who were not registered used a specialist outpatient clinic for all their medical needs. Of those who were registered and whose general practitioner was aware of their HIV status but who did not consult their doctor, 72% used a specialist outpatient clinic. Reasons for not consulting the general practitioner included fears of breach of confidentiality and lack of confidence in the general practitioner's understanding of HIV. Fifteen per cent of the sample continued to see a general practitioner who was unaware of their HIV status, for non-HIV related advice. The needs of patients must be taken into account when planning more integrated hospital and community care for those with HIV infection or the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)."
4781,0.002,2.0,"More than 1% of adults in the Dominican Republic are HIV-infected and most infections are acquired sexually. We studied sexual risk behaviors in a group of HIV-positive patients treated in Santiago, Dominican Republic.   Interviews were conducted with 129 participants seen in May 2006 at one of the country's largest public hospital HIV clinics. Questions included demographics, sexual history, condom use, and focused on patients' last sexual encounter.   Most patients (72.4%) had been sexually active since their HIV diagnosis. Following their diagnosis, 72.8% of sexually active patients used condoms more frequently, 21.7% used condoms with the same frequency, and 5.4% used condoms less often. The most common reason cited for not using a condom after HIV diagnosis differed by gender; men cited decreased sexual pleasure (70.0%) and women reported that their partner had refused to use a condom (71.8%). Sexually active patients who believed that their partner did not have HIV were much more likely to report using a condom at their last sexual encounter than those who did not know their partner's HIV status (odds ratio [OR] = 16.9).   HIV-positive patients reported using condoms more frequently following their HIV diagnosis and were more likely to use a condom if they believed their partner did not have HIV. Increased HIV testing may lead to reduced sexual risk behavior in the Dominican Republic."
2526,0.002,2.0,"Defective hepatitis B virus DNA (dDNA) is reverse-transcribed from spliced hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic messenger RNA (pgRNA) and has been identified in patients with chronic HBV (CH-B). The major 2.2-kb spliced pgRNA encodes a novel HBV gene product, the hepatitis B splice protein (HBSP) via a deletion and frame shift within the polymerase. Although spliced RNA and HBSP expression have been associated with increased HBV DNA levels and liver fibrosis, the role of dDNA in HBV-associated disease is largely undefined. Our aims were to (1) compare the relative proportions of dDNA (% dDNA) in a range of HBV-infected serum samples, including patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HBV coinfection and HBV-monoinfected persons with differing severities of liver disease, and (2) determine the effect of mutations associated with drug resistance on defective DNA production. Defective DNA was detected in 90% of persons with CH-B. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of dDNA between the monoinfected and HIV/HBV-coinfected groups. We also found no association between the % dDNA and alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e antigen status, HBV DNA levels, fibrosis levels, compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis, genotype, or drug treatment. However, the % dDNA was significantly lower in individuals infected with lamivudine-resistant (LMV-R) HBV compared with wild-type HBV (P < 0.0001), indicating that antiviral drug resistance alters the balance between defective and genomic length DNA in circulation. Experiments in vitro using HBV encoding LMV-R mutations confirmed these results."

To determine factors associated with zidovudine (ZDV) receipt among HIV-infected pregnant women we merged three data sets for women in New Jersey in 1995-1997, identifying 395 HIV-infected pregnant women. Half received two arms of ZDV prophylaxis. Attendance at five or more prenatal visits was the strongest independent factor related to ZDV receipt (OR 6.37, 95% CI 3.84, 10.57). Half (49.0%) had limited prenatal care. AIDS diagnosis, race/ethnicity, and drug use were also independently related to ZDV receipt. Post hoc analysis revealed that being unmarried, Black, multiparous, having no insurance, and illegal drug use were associated with limited prenatal care. Although the U.S. has seen reductions in HIV perinatal transmission, our research showed that HIV-infected women who did not get prenatal care were less likely to receive two arms of ZDV prophylaxis. A wide public health net that brings all women into care is necessary to reduce perinatal transmission further."
6380,0.002,2.0,"In Italy, about 7 % of the resident population is represented by immigrants originating from geographic regions at high endemicity for hepatitis B virus infection. This study aims to assess the prevalence of occult HBV infection (OBI) including the identification of HBV-genotypes in a population of immigrants serologically negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Between May 2006 and May 2010, 339 immigrants were tested for markers of HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. HBV-DNA was tested by using nested-PCR assays on three different genetic region. HBV-DNA was detected in plasma samples of 11/339 (3.2 %) patients. Most of them had no serological markers of HBV infection, 3/58 (5.2 %) were anti-HBc-alone, and 4/13 (30.8 %) were anti-HIV positive. HIV positivity was the only factor independently associated with the higher probability of observing OBI (OR = 16.5, p < 0.001). No HCV co-infected patients were found. Genotype D was detected in 9/11 (81.8 %) OBI cases, while the remaining two (18.2 %) were classified as genotype E. Although OBI was found at lower rate than expected among immigrants from highly endemic countries, anti-HBc alone positivity was confirmed as a sentinel marker of occult HBV infection. Nevertheless, a marked heterogeneity of HBV markers was found among HBV-DNA positive subjects. Our finding evidenced the predominance of HBV-genotype D viral strains among OBI cases, also in those from geographical areas where overt HBV infections are mainly sustained by viral genotypes other than D.

2040,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B and C continue to be major public health problems in France, particularly among migrants. The fact of being born in hepatitis B and C-endemic countries or of being a long-term resident of these countries are common risk factors, especially in the case of hepatitis B. Screening for both types of infection remains low among migrants. The main purpose of this study was to examine perceptions of the risk of viral hepatitis B and C in migrants among health professionals in Côte-d'Or (Burgundy, France) and to understand the factors promoting or hindering screening. The paper presents the results of a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews with 23 healthcare providers and 8 social workers. The participating health professionals were interviewed about their involvement in the fight against hepatitis B and C and their perceptions of the risk of infection among migrants. The interviews conducted with social workers focused mostly on the conditions of social and health support provided to migrants. The study found that hepatitis B and C screening among migrants was associated with HIV screening. Screening was found to be associated with formalities relating to the legal and administrative status of migrants, the type of accommodation or housing, health professionals' knowledge of the risk factors associated with the epidemiological and social/health context in the countries of origin, and their own involvement in humanitarian aid. Migrants seeking political asylum and living in reception centers were found to be more likely to undergo screening. The findings suggest that awareness of the importance of systematic screening for hepatitis B and C in migrants from hepatitis B and C-endemic areas needs to be promoted among social workers and health professionals, as recommended by the National Prevention and Control Program (2009-2012)."
3098,0.002,2.0,"Worldwide there is only limited information on the epidemiology of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and its association with other hepatotropic viruses. Endemic regions have been described in some Asian countries, whereas in Europe only sporadic cases have been reported. The prevalence of HEV and a series of other viral hepatitis infections was investigated in a group of 1,025 individuals immigrating into Germany from the former Soviet Union. Serum samples were tested for anti-HEV by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on recombinant proteins, and by peptide EIA and immunoblot. Risk factors and other demographic information were investigated using a questionnaire and a short interview. The overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis E antibodies (anti-HEV) was 2.05%. The following risk factors for HEV infection were identified: age of > 65 years, resident in the south-west part of the former Soviet Union, history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and employment in health care professions. HEV prevalence is not strikingly different from that observed in Western European countries. However, the different rates found for HEV vs. hepatitis A virus (HAV) are intriguing, since similar routes of transmission (fecal-oral) are well documented for both viruses. Exposure to HBV is surprisingly high, and the number of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive individuals was also higher than those reported from Western European areas."
5063,0.002,2.0,"The incidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among opiate users was determined in a retrospective cohort of 436 patients with multiple admissions to the only inpatient drug treatment program in northern Thailand between October 1993 and September 1995. During 323.4 person-years of follow-up, 60 patients presenting for detoxification acquired HIV-1 infection, for a crude incidence rate of 18.6 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 14.4-23.9). All seroconverters were male. HIV-1 incidence varied by the current route of drug administration: 31.3 per 100 person-years for injectors and 2.8 per 100 person-years for noninjectors (smoking and ingestion). Significant differences were found by ethnicity: HIV-1 incidence was 29.3 per 100 person-years for Thai lowlanders and 8.5 per 100 person-years for hill tribes. Multivariate relative risk estimates showed that injecting opiates (vs. use by other routes), being unmarried, being under age 40 years, being a Thai lowlander, having a primary and secondary education, and being employed in the business sector were each independently associated with human immunodeficiency virus seroconversion. This HIV-1 incidence rate is double that reported for Bangkok and suggests that prevention and control programs for drug users need to be expanded throughout Thailand. Improved availability of more-effective treatment regimens and increased access to sterile injection equipment are needed to confront the HIV-1 epidemic among opiate users in northern Thailand."
9345,0.002,2.0,"Co-infection of HBV with HIV results in an accelerated course of HBV-associated chronic liver disease. Several studies have shown that viral mutations are related to disease progression in mono-infection with HBV. However, it is unclear whether HBV mutation patterns might differ between co-infected and mono-infected patients. To compare the frequencies and mutation patterns in the HBV genome between co-infection and mono-infection. Twenty-four treatment-naïve co-infected and 31 treatment-naïve mono-infected Thai patients were included. HBV mutations were characterized by whole genome sequencing of virus serum samples. The clinical features and frequency of known clinically significant mutations were compared between the two groups. No significant difference between the groups was found with respect to sex, age and HBeAg. However, HBV DNA levels were significantly higher in co-infected patients. The distribution of HBV genotypes was comparable between the two groups and restricted mostly to sub-genotypes C1 and B2. An isolate with recombinants of genotypes G/C1 was also identified in a patient with co-infection. There was no difference in the prevalence of mutations in the enhancer II/basal core promoter/precore region, pre-S/S and polymerase genes between the two groups. In conclusion, dual infections tend to engender increased HBV DNA levels. There was no major difference in the frequencies of common HBV mutations between co-infected and mono-infected patients. Thus, HBV mutations may not contribute to disease pathogenesis in Thai patients with co-infection."
168,0.002,2.0,"A primary strategy for decreasing the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is to increase the rate of condom use among at-risk persons, and an important approach for reducing unintended pregnancies is to increase the use of effective contraception. Some women are at risk for both STDs and unintended pregnancy and require a highly effective strategy for protection against both risks. To assess the association between condom use at last intercourse and use of specific methods to prevent pregnancy among women at risk for HIV infection and other STDs, project investigators analyzed data from the Prevention of HIV in Women and Infants Demonstration Project. This report presents the findings of the analysis, which indicate that many women who were potentially well protected against pregnancy were underprotected against STDs."
1128,0.002,2.0,"Although improving health outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons has been identified as a national priority, little is known about the factors associated with hospitalizations of HIV-infected persons in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Since the introduction of HAART in 1996, there has been a dramatic increase in the life expectancy of HIV-infected persons. However, aging and the long term use of HIV medications have led to an increased incidence of chronic, non-HIV-related illnesses. To improve patient outcomes, the factors that contribute to co-morbidities in HIV-infected persons need to be identified. As a first step, we will summarize the current literature on causes and contributing factors of hospitalizations in adults infected with HIV in the HAART era. "
2791,0.002,2.0,"Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection often develop complications related directly to the infection, as well as to treatment. Aging, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. HIV-associated neurologic complications encompass a wide spectrum of pathophysiology and symptomatology. Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions are common among persons with HIV infection. Although some specific antiretroviral medications have been linked to disease development, traditional risk factors (e.g., smoking) have major roles. Prevention and management of viral hepatitis coinfection are important to reduce morbidity and mortality, and new anti-hepatitis C agents produce high rates of sustained virologic response. Antiretroviral-associated metabolic complications include dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and loss of bone mineral density. Newer options generally pose less risk of significant systemic toxicity and are better tolerated. Family physicians who care for patients with HIV infection have a key role in identifying and managing many of these chronic complications."

Of this total, 438 tested positive for HIV antibody (1.1%). Of these, 215 men returned for post test interview and physical exam and were compared with 1,348 men randomly selected HIV-1 seronegative men. None of the HIV-1 seropositive had a history of injecting drug use or had received blood transfusion in the past seven years. HIV-1 seropositivity was associated with the TPHA serological marker for syphylis > 1.160 (p = 0.015, odd ratio 1.8), history of urethritis (p = 0.009, odd ratio 1.92) (Table 4). This study found that HIV-1 seropositive men were mostly single, were likely to be from the rural northern provinces of Thailand or Bangkok. History of purchase of low-fee commercial sex and less condom use were significantly associated with HIV-1 seropositivity as was a history of STD in the year prior to interview. Information on HIV disease and pre-test/post test counselling is needed for Thai laborers who are applying for work abroad to countries which require HIV and syphylis screening. In this effort, the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare, the Ministry of Public Health and the clinic for laborers going abroad should join forces to provide this service. This will serve to increase awareness and self-determination among an increasingly vulnerable segment of the population who also have the potential to spread HIV infection to their spouse and other sex partners.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
410,0.002,2.0,"Two novel assays, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay and an assay based on the 5'-nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase, were developed for screening viral variants in lamivudine-treated patients' sera containing <1,000 copies of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome per ml. Both assays were designed to detect single-nucleotide changes within the HBV DNA polymerase gene that are associated with lamivudine resistance in vitro and have been used to screen a number of patients' sera for variant virus. Results obtained with these assays and standard sequencing technology were compared with regard to throughput, ability to detect individual virus species present at low concentrations, and ability to detect, distinguish, and quantitate wild-type (wt) and HBV tyrosine methionine(552) aspartate aspartate motif variants in mixed viral populations. Unlike DNA sequencing, both assays are amenable to high-throughput screening and were shown to be able to quantitatively detect variant virus in the presence of a background of wt virus. As with DNA sequencing, both new assays incorporate a PCR amplification step and are able to detect the relatively low amounts of virus found in lamivudine-treated patients' sera. However, these assays are far less labor intensive than the DNA-sequencing techniques presently in use. Overall, the RFLP assay was more sensitive than DNA sequencing in detecting and determining the ratios of wt to variant virus. Furthermore, the RFLP assay and 5'-nuclease assay were equally sensitive in the detection of mixed viral species, but the RFLP assay was superior to the 5'-nuclease assay in the quantitation of mixed viral species. These assays should prove useful for further understanding of virological response to therapy and disease progression."

However, replication and production of HIV-1 particles continued during the coinfection. Furthermore, the supernatant from cultures coinfected with HIV-1 and the mycoplasma contained a factor that inhibited the standard reverse transcriptase enzyme assay.

The expression of HLA class I antigen of hepatocytes of biopsied specimen and PBL HLA class I antigen expression showed relevancy. Then, the HLA antigen expression of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) and the 2-5AS activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were analyzed. In patients with type B or type C hepatitis, the mean activity of PBMC 2-5AS was significantly higher than that of healthy controls. Also the HLA class I antigen expression of PBL was significantly intense in patients with type B or type C hepatitis compared with healthy controls. In the acute exacerbated phase of type B chronic hepatitis, the HLA class I antigen expression of PBL and 2-5AS activity of PBMC increased along with elevation of serum GPT and then decreased with the remission of serum GPT. These results suggest that endogenously produced IFN leads the lysis of hepatocyte infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) by cytotoxic T cells, and the restriction of HBV replication by activation of the 2-5A system simultaneously, and then leads the elimination of HBV. The activity of PBMC 2-5AS and the expression of PBL HLA class I antigen increased significantly during IFN therapy. In type B chronic hepatitis, the effective cases showed relatively high activity of serum 2-5AS compared with the non-effective cases. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in PBL HLA class I antigen expression between effective cases and non-effective cases. In type C chronic hepatitis, most patients with type III and type IV HCV genotype showed disappearance of HCV-RNA regardless of serum 2-5AS activity. In patients with type II HCV genotype, the serum 2-5AS activity was related to the anti-viral effect of IFN therapy."

A blood specimen was collected to test for anti-HCV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay. We used generalized estimating equations while accounting for correlation of responses within villages to identify the factors associated with HCV infection. Of 1997 participants, 476 (23.8%) were anti-HCV positive. Overall, HCV infection was significantly associated with increasing age, ethnicity, and having received > or =2 blood transfusions, > or =3 hospitalizations, dental treatment and >5 injections among women.

The objective of this analysis was to examine the impact of chronic HCV infection and its treatment with combination therapy on work productivity. The 5-item, self-reported work productivity questionnaire (WPQ) was administered in Phase 3 trials to assess unemployment status, days unable to work due to HCV/treatment, reduced hours worked and impact on productivity in prior 4 weeks. Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were employed in analyses of pooled trial data. About 1147 patients were included; 22% (n = 255) were unemployed at baseline, with 8% being unemployed due to health reasons. At week 12, there were no differences by treatment regimen in the number of days unable to work. At week 48, improvements were observed earlier among patients receiving the shorter duration of T combination treatment. Mean (95% CI) change from baseline in days unable to work was -0.48 (-0.85, -0.11) days for T12PR24, 1.43 (0.63, 2.24) days for T12PR48 and 1.24 (0.18, 2.30) days for PR48 with placebo.

However, the ageing of patients leads to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease. Various studies have found that pharmaceutical care results in better control of cardiovascular risk factors. Objective To measure the impact of pharmaceutical care on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. Setting Outpatient pharmacy service of a tertiary hospital, Spain. Methods A pre/post-intervention quasi-experimental clinical study was conducted in which health education and pharmacist interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors were carried out in a single patient cohort using the Dader method of pharmacotherapy, with a 12-month follow-up period per patient. Patients included were older than 50 years, with moderate/elevated cardiovascular risk. Data were obtained from patient clinical histories, dispensing records and patient interviews, and were subjected to statistical analysis. Main outcome measure Cardiovascular risk estimated by SCORE and REGICOR equations. Results Forty-two patients completed the study. Of these, 93 % were men, with an average age of 57 years and 15 years since diagnosis of HIV. A reduction was observed in the mean values (baseline vs. 12 months) of the following cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure (P = 0.009), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010), total cholesterol (P = 0.006), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; P = 0.039), triglycerides (P = 0.010) and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c; P < 0.001). An increase in HDL-c (P = 0.037) was also observed. The average cardiovascular risk estimated by the SCORE instrument was reduced from 7.6 % at the beginning of the study to 6.4 % after 12 months (P = 0.039). The risk estimate according to REGICOR also decreased (P = 0.002). Over the 12-month period, 6.3 ± 3.4 interventions were carried out per patient. Quantitative ineffectiveness was the most prevalent negative outcome associated with medication throughout the study, and noncompliance was the most frequent cause. Interventions on health education were the most common, followed by interventions on improving adherence. Conclusion Pharmaceutical care, delivered as a combination of health education and pharmacotherapy follow-up to outpatients at a tertiary hospital, had a positive impact on cardiovascular risk in patients older than 50 years receiving combination antiretroviral therapy."

HTLV-1 infection in patients with B cell-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is rare and has been reported only in areas in which HTLV-1 is endemic. In the present study, we detected HTLV-1 proviral DNA by polymerase chain reaction, using tax primers, in peripheral blood lymphocytes from a B-CLL patient, an immigrant to Israel, where HTLV-1 infection is not endemic. F344 rats injected intravenously with peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from the patient developed HTLV-1 antibodies. Titers of antibody to HTLV-1 in the rat blood were 1:512 by particle agglutination; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were also positive. No antibody against HTLV-1 was demonstrated in the animal model after inoculation of either purified B lymphocytes from the B-CLL patient or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. This is one of the few studies showing the presence of HTLV-1 provirus in T lymphocytes of a B-CLL patient who had multiple infections, and died of salmonella sepsis, and the first report of HTLV-1 antibody induction in an animal model by inoculation of lymphocytes obtained from an HTLV-1-infected B-CLL patient."

The present study evaluated the outcome of salvage antiretroviral therapy (ART) recommended by an expert physician based on GRT in a non-clinical trial setting in Ribeirão Preto, Brazil. A prospective, open, nonrandomized study evaluating easy access to GRT at six Brazilian AIDS Clinics was carried out. This cooperative study analyzed the efficacy of treatment recommended to patients whose salvage ART was guided by GRT with that of treatment with ART based only on previous ART history. A total of 112 patients with ART failure were included in the study, and 77 of them were submitted to GRT. The median CD4 cell count and viral load for these 77 patients at baseline were (mean +/- SD) 252.1 +/- 157.4 cells/microL and 4.60 +/- 0.5 log10 HIV RNA copies/mL, respectively. The access time, i.e., the time elapsed between ordering the GRT and receiving the result was, on average, 71.9 +/- 37.3 days. The study results demonstrated that access to GRT followed by expert recommendations did not improve the time to persistent treatment failure when compared to conventional salvage ART. Access to GRT in this Brazilian community health care setting did not improve the long-term virologic outcomes of HIV-infected patients experiencing treatment failure. This result is probably related to the long time required to implement ART guided by GRT."

In this study, 245 blood samples from HBsAg-positive blood donors were collected from five geographically diverse blood centers in China. The S region of HBV was amplified, and the HBV genotype and subtype were determined. The amino acid sequences of the S region were aligned, and mutations related to the failure of immunization and HBsAg detection were determined. Of the 245 samples, 228 (93 %) were genotyped successfully. We found that genotypes B, C, D and A accounted for 58.8 %, 21.9 %, 6.6 % and 3.95 % of the isolates, respectively. The distribution of HBV antigen subtypes was as follows: adw (67.6 %), adr (23.3 %) and ayw (8.7 %). Mutations were present in 39 (17.1 %) of 228 samples in the major hydrophilic region (MHR) of the S region. This study demonstrated that HBV genotype/subtype B/adw was the most frequent strain circulating in HBV-infected Chinese blood donors, followed by C/adr. The occurrence of MHR mutants in HBV-infected blood donors and the potential failure to detect some of them in collected units poses a threat to transfusion safety."

5039,0.002,2.0,"Various clinical studies indicated a lower prevalence of HP infection in HIV patients. The present study was initiated to determine whether the decreased frequency of HP infections in HIV patients might be associated with the stage of the underlying HIV disease or concomitant drug regimens the patients had received. 60 randomly selected HIV outpatients were stratified according to the stage of their HIV infection (CDC classification), their CD4 cell count and to the drug regimens they were given. Within these subgroups of patients, HP infection prevalence was separately investigated by serological and C13 breath testing. Data were compared to a reference population of 30 healthy volunteers. No difference in HP infection prevalence was found between the HIV infected patients in general and the reference cohort. A significantly lower proportion of HP infected individuals was observed among those HIV patients who had AIDS-defining diseases. Furthermore, a substantial but insignificant decrease of HP infection prevalence was noted in HIV patients with an extensive decline of CD4 cell count (< 100/microl). HIV patients who had received antimicrobial or H2-antagonizing drugs within 12 months prior to the study commencement also were found to have a remarkably decreased frequency of HP infections independently of their CD4 cell count. No association between HP infection prevalence and patients age, sex, risk group and the type of their antiretroviral treatment was found.We concluded from these results that the decreased HP infection prevalence in HIV patients may, apart from frequent antibiotic treatment, be correlated to the stage of HIV-mediated immune suppression."

This increase can only be partly explained by a higher migratory flow and might reflect a delayed access to health facilities and to antiretroviral therapy in migrants. We performed a survey for the year 2003 of HIV-infected immigrants to Italy from countries outside the European Union to verify which factors might influence a lack of access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Italian centers of infectious diseases were requested to send sociodemographic and clinical data of HIV-infected immigrant patients. A total of 553 HIV-infected immigrants (49.9% women) were evaluated, representing 6.5% of all HIV-infected patients from these centers. The mean duration of residency in Italy was 6.6 +/- 5.0 years. The country of origin was Africa (64.5%), North and South America (24.2%), Eastern Europe (7.0%), and Asia (3.8%). A total of 407 of 553 patients (73.6%) were taking antiretroviral drugs at the time of screening. Females presented a younger age (p = 0.001), a lower frequency of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) stage B/C (p = 0.008) and a more frequent heterosexual exposure to HIV (p < 0.001), while no differences were observed for time of first positive serology (p = 0.7).

Methods This was a cross-sectional, operational research study of HIV-related interventions among TB cases and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of TB-HIV coinfected patients. It also used a retrospective cohort design to determine the association between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and favorable TB treatment outcomes. The source of data was a linkage of 2011 administrative health databases used by the National TB and HIV/AIDS Programs. Results Of 73 741 new cases of TB reported, 63.6% (46 865 patients) were tested for HIV; 10.3% were positive. Of patients with HIV, 45.9% or 3 502 were on ART. TB favorable outcome was achieved in 63.1% or 2 205 coinfected patients on ART and in only 35.4% or 1 459 of those not on ART. On multivariate analysis, the relative risk for the association between ART and TB treatment success was 1.72 (95% Confidence Interval = 1.64-1.81). Conclusions The linkage between national TB and HIV datasets has created a convenient baseline for ongoing monitoring of HIV testing, ART use, and TB treatment outcomes among coinfected patients. The low rates of HIV screening and ART use in 2011 need to be improved. The association between ART and treatment success adds to the evidence supporting timely initiation of ART for all patients with TB-HIV coinfection."

In four patients (7.1%), PH not related to other well-known associated conditions, was disclosed. In spite of a low serum HIV RNA viral load and a high-efficacy antiretroviral therapy, including a protease inhibitor in two patients, PH developed and worsened. It could be hypothesized that in some patients with an individual immunogenetic predisposition, a high secretion of cytokines and endothelin-1 stimulated by an unidentified pathogen different from HIV could lead to PH. Antiretroviral therapy seems not to prevent or reduce right ventricle pressure gradient in PH."

After adjusting for age, time, entry time into HOP, pregnancy, CD4 count, substance abuse status, and social and clinical stressors, receipt of more than four combined case manager contacts or ancillary services per month was significantly associated with being prescribed a protease inhibitor, improved adherence and retention in primary care, and enrolling on a research protocol. Receiving more than one transportation service per month was significantly associated with improved adherence, improved retention, one or more emergency room visits per month, and one or more hospitalizations per month. Receiving more than one contact with case managers per month was associated with improved retention in primary care. Findings suggest that receipt of case management and ancillary services is associated with improvements in multiple outcomes for HIV-infected women. A client-centered approach to providing ancillary services appears to be effective in improving behavioral and utilization characteristics in this population of low-income, high-risk women."
1006,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this work was to evaluate in a case-control study the immunogenicity of a recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Seventy-seven patients with histologically proven chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis were included in a prospective trial and matched for sex and age to 231 healthy adult subjects. Recombinant HBV vaccine was administered at a dose of 20 microg at months 0, 1 and 2. The definition of 'responder to vaccination' was anti-HBs titre > 10 mIU/ml after the three injections. Forty-nine (63.6%) chronic hepatitis C patients were responders to vaccination, compared with 217 (93.9%) controls (P < 0.0001). After the three injections, anti-HBs titres were 156 +/- 260 and 615 +/- 435 mIU/ml (P < 0.0001), respectively. Chronic hepatitis C patients who were non-responders to vaccination had significantly higher viral load than responders to vaccination. Moreover, a negative correlation was observed between viral load and anti-HBs concentration (r = -0.36, P = 0.003). No significant side effects were observed. There was no effect of vaccination on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load during or after vaccination. In multivariate analysis, the main predictive factors of response to HBV vaccine were absence of anti-HCV antibodies (OR = 7.65, P < 0.0001), weight < 75 kg (OR = 1.99, P < 0.035), and age < 50 years (OR = 1.58, P < 0.082). Our results suggest that viral load seems to negatively influence the response to HBV vaccine."
5516,0.002,2.0,"During January-April, 2000, 12 cases of acute hepatitis B were reported in Pierce County, Washington, compared with seven in all of 1999. Seven (58.3%) case patients were injection drug users (IDUs), three of whom were coinfected with hepatitis D virus (HDV) and died of fulminant hepatitis. Vaccination clinics were implemented at the local health department and needle exchange program to control the outbreak. We investigated this outbreak to determine risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission among IDUs. Hepatitis B cases were ascertained through routine surveillance and prevaccination testing at vaccination clinics. We conducted a case-control study comparing IDU case patients with HBV-susceptible IDUs identified at the vaccination clinics. Fifty-eight case patients were identified during January-December, 2000, 20 (34.5%) of whom were coinfected with HDV. Thirty-eight case patients (65.5%) reported current IDU. In the case-control study, the 17 case patients were more likely than the 141 controls to report having more than one sex partner [odds ratio (OR) =4.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.5-15.0], injecting more than four times a day (OR = 4.5, 95% CI =1.2-15.6) and sharing drug cookers with more than two people (58.8% vs. 14.0%, OR =14.0, 95% CI =2.4-81.5). Results were similar after controlling for syringe sharing in multivariable analysis. IDUs should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and should be advised against sharing drug injection equipment."
2344,0.002,2.0,"The indinavir dosage regimen currently used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children is not based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in the target patient population. The purpose of our study was to characterize indinavir pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in HIV-infected children. Eleven children (age range, 9.0 to 13.6 years; weight range, 21.7 to 56.0 kg) receiving indinavir (500 mg/m(2) every 8 h) in combination with lamivudine and stavudine were studied. The correlation of indinavir pharmacokinetic parameters and demographic parameters was evaluated. Also, the pharmacodynamic relationship between parameters of indinavir exposure and parameters of renal toxicity and immunologic recovery was studied. The area under the indinavir concentration-time curve (AUC) and patient body surface area (BSA) showed a significant negative correlation (r = 0.73; P = 0.012). Patients with smaller BSA had excessive indinavir AUC compared to adults. On the other hand, the median minimum drug concentration in plasma (C(min)) was lower than that reported for adults. The maximum indinavir concentration in serum was higher in patients with renal toxicity (5 out of 11 children), but the difference was not statistically significant (15.3 +/- 8.2 versus 9.8 +/- 4.4 mg/liter; P = 0.19). There was a trend toward higher immunologic efficacy in patients with greater indinavir exposure: the time-averaged AUC of the percentage of CD4(+) lymphocytes over the baseline value for patients with indinavir C(min) > 95% inhibitory concentration (IC(95)) was higher than in patients with C(min) < IC(95) (P = 0. 068). Our study suggests that a dose reduction may be appropriate for children with small BSA and that a 6-h dosage regimen may be indicated for a substantial percentage of patients. Due to the low number of patients enrolled in this study, our results should be confirmed by a larger study."
948,0.002,2.0,"Lamivudine, a novel cytosine analogue, exhibits potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in vitro and in vivo. The standard HBV DNA hybridization assay used in phase II clinical studies has a low sensitivity, the detection limit of HBV DNA levels being approximately 10(7) genome equivalents per ml (geq ml-1). In this work we used a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (detection limit approximately 10(3) geq ml-1) to determine HBV DNA levels during a 24-week study of lamivudine in 51 stable chronic hepatitis B patients who were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Patients were randomly allocated to receive oral doses of 25, 100 or 300 mg lamivudine once daily. At week 24 the median serum concentration of HBV DNA had fallen from 10(8) to 10(4) geq ml-1, a 4-log median reduction. A trend towards more profound suppression of viral replication with an increased dose of lamivudine was observed. After 12 weeks of therapy, 12% of patients had an HBV DNA level that was undetectable in the PCR assay; this increased to 26% after 24 weeks, while in an additional 20% of patients, HBV DNA decreased to the level of detection of the PCR assay. We conclude that a 24-week course of lamivudine decreases serum HBV DNA to the level of PCR detection in 46% of patients. Such additional viral suppressive activity with higher doses and more protracted lamivudine may be of clinical utility prior to liver transplantation. Further studies are needed to define the degree of virus suppression required in clinical practice, and methods are required to increase the efficacy of virus suppression."
9246,0.002,2.0,"Most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission in developing countries occurs through heterosexual intercourse or during birth from mother to child. It is critical to characterize the virus of the genital tract variants as a target for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine and microbicidal therapies. We compared the C2V3 env domain genetic diversity of HIV-1 in female genital secretions and in plasma from Ethiopian women seeking care for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Sequences within an individual differed between the plasma and cervicovaginal lavage (CLV) compartments with nucleotide and amino acid median difference values of 8.3 and 4.8%, respectively. Sequence diversity in CVL was greater than in plasma. And the V3 loop positive charge was often more elevated in CVL. These are markers of the differential evolution of the viruses in CVL and peripheral blood indicating that limited evolution at the site of contact is not the limiting factor determining the preferential transmission of macrophage tropic viruses."
5763,0.002,2.0,"The combination of antiretroviral (ARV) therapies introduced at the end of the 1990s profoundly changed the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Liver diseases are one of the three primary causes of 'non-AIDS-related' death in people living with HIV for three reasons: the high prevalence of hepatotropic viral co-infections, the hepatotoxicity of ARV drugs and new emerging liver diseases, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia and hepatitis E virus infection. The impact of HIV infection on the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HIV co-infection has markedly changed in the past few decades with the progress made in ARV treatment and the improved definition of therapeutic strategies for HCV or HBV. Initially, HIV had a negative impact on hepatotropic infections. Today, HIV does not appear to significantly modify the natural history of HCV and HBV infection. This is associated with fair immune restoration, viral suppression associated with analogues having dual activity against HBV and HIV and with the increasing efficacy of antiviral treatments against HCV. A significant decline is expected in the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic liver infection in co-infected patients. Nevertheless, today, there are three major issues: (i) improving preventive measures including vaccination and risk reduction; (ii) screening patients infected with HBV or HCV and evaluating the impact of chronic infection on the liver and finally; (iii) early screening of hepatocellular carcinoma whose occurrence is higher and that evolves more rapidly in co-infected than in mono-infected patients."
6017,0.002,2.0,"We estimated seroincidence of HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the prevalence of risk behaviors among injection drug users (IDUs) who accepted inpatient detoxification by 14-day methadone tapering treatment in the Shanghai Drug Abuse Treatment Center. We also evaluated the effect of an HIV/AIDS prevention education intervention on those IDUs. Data including demographic characteristics, HIV, HBV and HCV seroincidence, sexual and injection-related risk behaviors were collected from 101 IDUs. All subjects received HIV/AIDS prevention education during inpatient detoxification treatment. An HIV-knowledge questionnaire was used to evaluate the effects of this intervention. We found that risk behaviors, including unsafe sex and unclean injection practices, were common among the subjects. The seroincidence of HBV and HCV infection rates was 56.4% and 46.5%, respectively, but no HIV-infected case was found among the subjects. After participating in the HIV/AIDS prevention intervention, subjects' scores (M+/-SD) on the HIV-knowledge questionnaire were significantly improved from baseline (97.29+/-7.42 vs. 31.1+/-12.1). Our study confirmed that IDUs in Shanghai are a high-risk population for blood borne diseases such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C and HIV. HIV/AIDS prevention education increased HIV knowledge, improved understanding of HIV prevention methods and changed attitudes toward HIV/AIDS. Therefore, HIV/AIDS prevention education should to be an important component of drug treatment."
8924,0.002,2.0,"As hepatitis B and C share modes of transmission, their combined occurrence is not uncommon, particularly in areas where both viruses are endemic and in individuals at high-risk of parenteral infection. Both viral hepatitis infections form an important global public health problem, responsible for over half a billion chronic infections worldwide. Their distinctive characteristics impact upon their epidemiology, transmission, and the success of the different prevention strategies. Since several decades a safe and effective vaccine has been available to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Universal vaccination is the cornerstone of global HBV control. Despite major success, vaccine uptake is hampered, and increasing efforts are required to eliminate acute and chronic hepatitis B. Unlike hepatitis C and HIV, HBV has not captured sufficient attention from policymakers, advocacy groups, or the general public: a major challenge for the future. Although progress has been made in the development of an hepatitis C vaccine, short-term successes are not expected. Even without a vaccine, successes can be reported in the field of hepatitis C due to e.g. implementation of universal precautionary measures in health-care settings, screening of blood and blood products, and identification and counselling of infected people. Despite important efforts, transmission in injecting drug users is increasing."
4638,0.002,2.0,"The epidemiology of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important for health planners and service providers. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors for markers of HBV (HBsAg) and anti-HCV among hemodialysis patients at the Ahmed Gasim hemodialysis unit, Sudan. Structured questionnaires were used to obtain socio-demographic data and sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HCV (anti-HCV). Of the 353 patients enrolled in the study, HBsAg and anti-HCV were detected in 16 (4.5%) and 30 (8.5%) patients, respectively. None of the patients were co-infected with HBV and HCV. Multivariate analysis showed that duration of dialysis was significantly associated with anti-HCV seropositivity [OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 1.2-1.3; P = 0.024]. No other socio-demographic or clinical characteristics (age, sex, level of education, history of surgery, and number of units of blood transfused) were significantly associated with HBsAg or anti-HCV seropositivity. The results of this study suggest that HBsAg and anti-HCV have low prevalence among hemodialysis patients in Khartoum. Longer duration of dialysis was a risk factor for anti-HCV."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a global health problem especially in Egypt having the highest HCV prevalence worldwide where HCV infection is a continuing epidemic. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between genetic variation in TLR-3 and TLR-9 and HCV infection and hepatic fibrosis in chronic HCV-positive Egyptian patients. The present study included 100 naïve chronic HCV-positive patients and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Genotyping of TLR-3 (_7 C/A [rs3775296]), TLR-3 (c.1377C/T [rs3775290]) and TLR-9 (1237T/C [rs5743836]) were done by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism technique.

178,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype G (HBV/G) was detected in sera from four individuals by polymerase chain reaction with hemi-nested primers deduced from an insertion of 36 nt in the core gene that is specific for this genotype. Despite two stop codons in the precore region characteristic of HBV/G, all patients were positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in serum. When 10 HBV clones were propagated from one patient, and sequenced within precore region and a section of the core gene, 6 clones were HBV/G while 2 were genotype A (HBV/A); a recombination between HBV/G and HBV/A occurred in the remaining 2 clones. Mixed infection of HBV/G and HBV/A, as well as the recombination, was demonstrated in the sequence of preS1 and preS2 regions also. Coinfection with HBV/G and HBV/A was demonstrated in the other three patients, and their recombination in two patients. Ten HBV clones were propagated from one patient at two time points separated by 1 year. Clones of HBV/A, HBV/G and their recombination were found in 9 : 1 : 0 when the patient was positive for HBeAg, while the proportion shifted to 0 : 8 : 2 after the patient seroconverted to anti-HBe. In conclusion, HBV/G is frequently found as a coinfection with HBV/A. This coinfection would explain the presence of HBeAg in individuals infected with HBV/G. Along with seroconversion to anti-HBe, HBV/G would be selected accompanied by the recombination with HBV/A. Further studies should be performed to confirm these findings."

Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the parotid lesion showed a diffuse infiltrate of large mononuclear cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, consistent with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated expression of the T-cell markers CD3 and UCHL-1, as well as latent membrane protein 1 and T-cell intracellular antigen 1. Flow cytometry showed surface expression of CD2, CD3, CD7 (dim), CD8, and CD56. CD5 was not expressed. Molecular evaluation by polymerase chain reaction demonstrated monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gamma gene. Epstein-Barr virus early RNA and human immunodeficiency virus RNA were demonstrated by in situ hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of T-cell lymphoma of the parotid in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.

Cocultivation of the peripheral blood leukocytes of the patient with normal donor leukocytes yielded a leukocyte culture in which HIV virus expression was demonstrated. The HIV antigen was detected in the ultracentrifugate of the cultures by means of indirect enzyme-immunoassay using sera to the virus from the standard kits of Organon (Netherlands) and Abbot (USA). HIV antigen was also detected on the surface of lymphocytes in the culture by indirect immunofluorescence using the same sera.

5910,0.002,2.0,"Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a novel, rapid and noninvasive technique to assess liver fibrosis. Our objective was to compare transient elastography (TE) and other noninvasive serum indexes as alternatives to liver biopsy in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients. The fibrosis stage (METAVIR Score), TE, the aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, the Forns fibrosis index, FIB-4 and HGM-2 indexes were assessed in 100 patients between January 2007 and January 2008. The diagnostic values were compared by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs). Using TE, the AUROC (95% CI) of liver stiffness was 0.80 (0.72-0.89) when discriminating between F <or= 1 and F > 2, 0.93 (0.85-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 2 and F > 3 and 0.99 (0.97-1.00) when discriminating between F <or= 3 and F4. For the diagnosis of F >or= 3, the AUROCs of TE were significantly higher than those obtained with the other four noninvasive indexes. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, three cutoff values were chosen to identify F <or= 1 (<7 kPa), F >or= 3 (>or=11 kPa) and F4 (>or=14 kPa). Using these best cutoff scores, the negative predictive value and positive predictive value were 81.1% and 70.2% for the diagnosis of F <or= 1, 96.3% and 60% for the diagnosis of F >or= 3 and 100% and 57.1% for the diagnosis of F4. Thus, Transient elastography accurately predicted liver fibrosis and outperformed other simple noninvasive indexes in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. Our data suggest that TE is a helpful tool for guiding therapeutic decisions in clinical practice."

6536,0.002,2.0,"The prospective, multisite human immunodeficiency (HIV) Epidemiology Research Study was established to define the biologic, psychologic, and social effects of HIV infection on the health of US women. From 1993 to 1995, a total of 871 HIV-infected women and 439 demographically matched, uninfected women aged 16-55 years, half of whom reported injection drug use and half of whom reported only sexual risk behaviors, were recruited in four US cities. Two sites recruited primarily from medical/drug therapy care settings, and two recruited from community sources. Women consented to biannual interviews; physical examination; blood, urine, and cervicovaginal specimen collection and repository; laboratory assays; and abstraction of outpatient and inpatient medical records to document HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related diagnoses. Retention was greater than 88% at the third 6-month follow-up. Lower retention was associated with currently injecting drugs, not having dependent children, and not being infected with HIV at enrollment. In addition to the core study, a variety of nested studies are under way, some in collaboration with other HIV cohorts and various Public Health Service agencies. This cohort is distinct from other HIV longitudinal cohorts in the diversity of its participants and the comprehensive range of measures to study prospectively the biomedical, social, and emotional effects of the HIV epidemic on infected women and those whose behavior puts them at high risk of infection."

HIV testing was offered to all pregnant women who visited three prenatal clinics in Dar es Salaam before 34 weeks' gestation. Group or individual pretest counseling was performed by trained midwives. Laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection was based on two sequential anti-HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Posttest counseling was given 2 weeks later to women who wished to know their HIV status. HIV testing was offered to a total of 10,010 pregnant women from June 1996 to May 1998, of whom 76.4% (7647 of 10,010) agreed to be tested. The prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 13.7% (1050 of 7647). Overall, 68.1% (5205 of 7647) returned for their results. Of the HIV-1-seropositive respondents, 27.4% (288 of 1050) agreed to participate in the Petra trial after fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Only 16.7% (48 of 288) of the enrolled women disclosed their positive HIV serostatus to their sexual partners. The main reasons for not disclosing the HIV serostatus were fear of stigma and divorce. Sixty percent (29 of 48) of the informed sex partners agreed to be tested for HIV and 69% (20 of 29) tested HIV seropositive. Pregnancy recurrence rate was 4.4 per 100 women years (18 pregnancies during 408 women years of follow-up) with 10 of 18 (55.6%) women not wanting to carry the pregnancy to term. In conclusion, this information is useful in planning intervention programs for prevention of mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission and it shows that improvements are required in counseling."
2072,0.002,2.0,"This qualitative, exploratory study investigated knowledge about perinatal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and perceptions of the childbearing role among women at risk for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through injection drug use. Content analysis was used to analyze the results of 21 face-to-face, semistructured interviews with women who had a personal history of injection drug use or who were the sexual partners of men who injected drugs. Contextual variables influencing women at risk for HIV infection that were identified included fear of HIV antibody testing, a belief that perinatal HIV transmission is inevitable, support for pregnancy termination in the event of HIV-associated pregnancy, a strong desire for children, pride in mothering behavior, and guilt about the possibility of transmitting HIV to unborn children. AIDS education and counseling for these women will be most effective if these variables are considered."
1441,0.002,2.0,"Telaprevir and boceprevir, the two first hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PIs), considerably increase rates of sustained virologic response in association with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. The 30 first patients treated by telaprevir or boceprevir including anti-HCV therapies since 2011 in Marseille University hospitals, France, were monitored. HCV loads and plasmatic concentrations of telaprevir and boceprevir were determined on sequential blood samples. HCV NS3 protease gene population sequencing was performed at baseline of treatment and in case of treatment failure. Fifteen patients (including 7 co-infected with HIV) received telaprevir and the other 15 patients (including 4 co-infected with HIV) received boceprevir. At baseline, HCV NS3 protease from six patients harbored amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance. Treatment failure occurred at week 12 for 7 patients. Amino acid substitutions associated with PI-resistance were observed in six of these cases. HCV NS3 R155K and T54A/S mutants, all of genotype 1a, were found from four patients. Median (interquartile range) plasma concentrations were 3,092 ng/ml (2,320-3,525) for telaprevir and 486 ng/ml (265-619) for boceprevir. For HIV-HCV co-infected patients, median concentrations were 3,162 ng/ml (2,270-4,232) for telaprevir and 374 ng/ml (229-519) for boceprevir. Plasma drug concentration monitoring revealed undetectable concentrations for two patients at week 4, and probable non-adherence to therapy for another patient. These findings indicate that routine HCV NS3 protease sequencing and plasma PI concentration monitoring might be helpful to characterize cases of therapy failure, at a cost dramatically low compared to that of anti-HCV therapy."
9847,0.002,2.0,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) epidemic has spread dramatically in sub-Saharan African countries. Implementation of active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy programs is urgently needed. However this emergency situation must not extenuate the importance of preliminary studies on ARV resistance of African HIV-1 isolates. Findings show that genetic mutations underlying the resistance of African strains are generally identical to those observed in HIV-1 subtype B in industrialized countries. However the incidence of some mutations associated with mild resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) appears higher in African isolates. The potential impact of these mutations for development of frank resistance to PI is still unclear. The incidence of high-grade resistance markers in untreated subjects is low. While these results do not compromise use of ARV therapy in Africa, they underline the need to set up local networks for patient follow-up and to carry out epidemiological surveillance of HIV-1 resistance. Success of ARV therapies in Africa will also depend on economic and social programs."
8996,0.002,2.0,"We review applications of the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale for use in studies of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. The QWB scale is a preference-weighted decision theory-based measure that summarizes outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In order to validate the QWB scale for HIV-infected patients, the measure was administered in the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) HIV Neural Behavioral Research Center (HNRC). Data are presented for a cohort of 400 HIV-positive-infected men and 114 HIV-uninfected male controls. The evidence suggests that the QWB scale is a significant prospective predictor of mortality. The QWB scale was concurrently associated with the number of CD4+ lymphocytes and ratings of neurological impairment based upon clinical evaluations. Further, the QWB scale was related to neuropsychological assessments derived from formal tests of cognitive functioning. Neuropsychological impairments may be associated with income loss for affected patients. The QWB scale scores were lower among patients with clinical depression. We conclude that the QWB scale is an appropriate general health outcome measure for use in observational studies and clinical trials for patients with HIV disease."
6756,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease is a known target of CD8+ T cell responses, but it is the only HIV-1 protein in which no fully characterized HIV-1 protease CD4 epitopes have been identified to date. We investigated the recognition of HIV-1 protease by CD4+ T cells from 75 HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitor (PI)-treated patients, using the 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based proliferation assay. In order to identify putative promiscuous CD4+ T cell epitopes, we used the TEPITOPE algorithm to scan the sequence of the HXB2 HIV-1 protease. Protease regions 4-23, 45-64 and 73-95 were identified; 32 sequence variants of the mentioned regions, encoding frequent PI-induced mutations and polymorphisms, were also tested. On average, each peptide bound to five of 15 tested common human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR) molecules. More than 80% of the patients displayed CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cell recognition of at least one of the protease peptides. All 35 peptides were recognized. The response was not associated with particular HLA-DR or -DQ alleles. Our results thus indicate that protease is a frequent target of CD4+ along with CD8+ proliferative T cell responses by the majority of HIV-1-infected patients under PI therapy. The frequent finding of matching CD4(+) and CD8+ T cell responses to the same peptides may indicate that CD4+ T cells provide cognate T cell help for the maintenance of long-living protease-specific functional CD8+ T cells."

42,0.002,2.0,"In order to determine phenotypic protease and reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated resistance in HIV subtype C virus, we have synthetically constructed an HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1-C) viral backbone for use in a recombinant virus assay. The in silico designed viral genome was divided into 4 fragments, which were chemically synthesized and joined together by conventional subcloning. Subsequently, gag-protease-reverse-transcriptase (GPRT) fragments from 8 HIV-1 subtype C-infected patient samples were RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into the HIV-1-C backbone (deleted for GPRT) using In-Fusion reagents. Recombinant viruses (1 to 5 per patient sample) were produced in MT4-eGFP cells where cyto-pathogenic effect (CPE), p24 and Viral Load (VL) were monitored. The resulting HIV-1-C recombinant virus stocks (RVS) were added to MT4-eGFP cells in the presence of serial dilutions of antiretroviral drugs (PI, NNRTI, NRTI) to determine the fold-change in IC50 compared to the IC50 of wild-type HIV-1 virus. Additionally, viral RNA was extracted from the HIV-1-C RVS and the amplified GPRT products were used to generate recombinant virus in a subtype B backbone. Phenotypic resistance profiles in a subtype B and subtype C backbone were compared. The following observations were made: i) functional, infectious HIV-1 subtype C viruses were generated, confirmed by VL and p24 measurements; ii) their rate of infection was slower than viruses generated in the subtype B backbone; iii) they did not produce clear CPE in MT4 cells; and iv) drug resistance profiles generated in both backbones were very similar, including re-sensitizing effects like M184V on AZT."
5549,0.002,2.0,"The total number of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in South Africa was estimated from a number of sources of seroprevalence for each of these viruses. A total figure of 122,951 HIV-infected individuals in South Africa was arrived at for January 1991; 69% (85,247) were from the urban black population and 20% (24,474) from the rural black population. The male homosexual population constituted some 7% (8,175) of the total, 94% of whom were white; however, this probably represented a substantial underestimation of the size of this population. A total of 1,475,223 carriers of HBV virus was calculated for South Africa from data obtained from 1986 to 1990. Of these, 88% (1,302,741) came from the rural black population and 8% (114,118) from the urban black population. Extrapolations from small sample numbers and often with broad assumptions are subject to considerable error. Nevertheless, estimated total figures do provide a vivid picture of the extent of these two epidemics."
4983,0.002,2.0,Thirty four patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had lymphadenopathy were investigated using fine needle aspiration. Cytological analysis included immunocytochemical investigation with the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method. All patients had confirmation of cytological diagnosis by lymph node biopsy. Fifteen aspirates with follicular hyperplasia were evaluated. Eleven patients showed B cell predominance. The B cell population did not show light chain restriction. Ten patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (five with Burkitt's lymphoma and five with B cell immunoblastic lymphoma) were investigated. Nine out of 10 cases were monoclonal with respect to their light chain determinants; only one case with Burkitt's lymphoma with partial lymph node metastasis did not show light chain restriction. The cytological diagnosis included two mycobacterial infections and four cystic lesions. Histological investigation was necessary to diagnose the extent of lymph node disease caused by Kaposi's sarcoma. These findings indicate that the immunocytological investigation of lymph node aspirates is useful for evaluating lymphadenopathy in HIV positive patients.
1916,0.002,2.0,"Entecavir (ETV) is a potent antiviral nucleoside analogue that is used to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that ETV is also active against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Unlike all approved nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase RT) inhibitors (NRTIs), ETV contains a 3'-hydroxyl group that allows further nucleotide incorporation events to occur. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition probably differs from classic chain termination. Here, we show that the incorporated ETV-monophosphate (MP) can interfere with three distinct stages of DNA synthesis. First, incorporation of the next nucleotide at position n + 1 following ETV-MP is compromised, although DNA synthesis eventually continues. Second, strong pausing at position n + 3 suggests a long range effect, referred to as ""delayed chain-termination."" Third, the incorporated ETV-MP can also act as a ""base pair confounder"" during synthesis of the second DNA strand, when the RT enzyme needs to pass the inhibitor in the template. Enzyme kinetics revealed that delayed chain termination is the dominant mechanism of action. High resolution foot-printing experiments suggest that the incorporated ETV-MP ""repels"" the 3'-end of the primer from the active site of HIV-1 RT, which, in turn, diminishes incorporation of the natural nucleotide substrate at position n + 4. Most importantly, delayed chain termination protects ETV-MP from phosphorolytic excision, which represents a major resistance mechanism for approved NRTIs. Collectively, these findings provide a rationale and important tools for the development of novel, more potent delayed chain terminators as anti-HIV agents."
9997,0.002,2.0,"Recurrence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the graft is the major problem for patients with chronic HBV infection undergoing liver transplantation, which could be potentiated by the immunosuppression. In the present study, we used lymphocytes and hepatocytes isolated from patients with chronic HBV infection to investigate in vitro the effects of FK506 with and without methylprednisolone (25 ng/mL) on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell activation marker expression, and HBV replication in human hepatocytes. Increasing concentrations of FK506 (0.1, 0.5, and 5 ng/mL) resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with a reduction of the stimulation index by 9.2%, 39.0%, and 55.1%, respectively, with no difference between 25 chronic HBV carriers and normal controls. Methylprednisolone alone had no effect but potentiated the inhibitory effect of all three FK506 concentrations, such that the stimulation index was decreased by 20%, 56.2%, and 65.7%, respectively. FK506 (0.5 ng/ mL) reduced both the percentage of interleukin-2 receptor expressing T cells and the cell surface density of this receptor by 7.1% and 8.7% (P < .01), whereas it only reduced the proportion of HLA-DR expressing T cells by 6.8%. FK506 did not change significantly the intracellular HBV DNA or the hepatic expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in short-term culture of human hepatocytes, whereas methylprednisolone increased the percentage of HBsAg-positive hepatocytes in all 5 patients with active viral replication. These results indicate that the effects of FK506 on T-cell activation in chronic HBV carriers are identical to normal subjects, resulting in marked suppression of T-lymphocyte function but only modest reduction in the expression of cell surface activation markers. The drug showed no direct stimulatory effect on viral replication, suggesting that FK506 can be a useful, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agent for liver graft recipients with chronic HBV infection."
2997,0.002,2.0,"To characterize neurological and neuropsychological findings associated with human immunodeficiency virus type-I (HIV) infection, 77 seropositive homosexual or bisexual males with no or minor symptoms of HIV were compared prospectively to 44 HIV seronegative men by observers blinded to serological status of the subjects. Neurological symptoms and examination findings were not significantly different between seropositives and seronegatives except for cranial nerve findings, predominantly mild hearing impairment. Mean performance scores for a 15-test neuropsychological battery were within an unimpaired range for both groups, although for five tests, mean scores were significantly poorer in seropositives. After adjustment for vocabulary score, and demographic and psychosocial variables, the mean score of seropositives was significantly worse only for the Benton Visual Retention Test. Magnetic resonance (MR) images of brain were abnormal in 14 (27%) of 52 seropositives and one of 10 seronegatives (value was not significant). HIV was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 31 (61%) of 51 seropositives. The only clinical or laboratory difference between CSF culture positives and negatives was a higher CSF immunoglobulin synthesis rate in the former subjects (medians of 10.3 versus 0.1 mg/day; p = 0.03). An additional 13 seropositive subjects had immunologic evidence of central nervous system HIV infection, defined by a serum-to-CSF HIV antibody ratio of less than 5.5. Intracranial abnormalities on MR imaging were associated with CSF immunologic responses to HIV. Nervous system involvement occurred in the vast majority of men with early HIV infection, but clinically significant impairment was uncommon."
6215,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA has been localized in antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) from patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). DCs from patients with CHC also exhibit impaired functional capacities. However, HCV RNA in DCs and functional impairment of DCs in CHC might be independent or interrelated events. Moreover, the impact of antiviral therapy on the functions of DCs in CHC is not well documented. In order to address these issues, we took advantage of antiviral therapy in these patients. Ten patients with CHC, expressing HCV RNA in circulating DCs, became negative for HCV RNA in circulating DCs after therapy with interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 4 weeks. The functions of DCs from HCV RNA+ patients (isolated before antiviral therapy) and HCV RNA- patients (isolated 4 weeks after antiviral therapy) were compared in allogenic mixed leucocyte reactions. In comparison to circulating DCs from normal control subjects, DCs from HCV RNA+ patients had a significantly decreased capacity to stimulate allogenic T lymphocytes (P < 0.01) and produce interleukin-12 (P < 0.05). However, the allostimulatory capacity of circulating DCs from HCV RNA- patients was several-fold higher compared to that of HCV RNA+ DCs from the same patient. DC from HCV RNA- patients also produced significantly higher levels of interleukin-12 compared to HCV RNA+ DCs from the same patient (P < 0.01). Taken together, this study is the first to provide experimental evidence regarding the impact of HCV RNA and antiviral therapy on the function of DCs in patients with CHC."
5795,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to monitor the prevalence of drug resistance mutations in newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive individuals in Denmark. In addition we assessed the prevalence of non-B subtypes based on phylogenetic analysis of the pol gene. Plasma samples from 104 newly diagnosed HIV-1 positive patients were obtained in the year 2000. The entire protease gene and 320 amino acids of the reverse transcriptase gene were genotyped. Sequences were obtained from 97 patients. No subjects displayed primary resistance mutations in the protease gene, whereas all carried 1 or more secondary mutations. Resistance mutations in the RT-gene associated with NRTI-resistance were found in 1 patient, who was infected with zidovudine resistant HIV-1 harbouring the M41L mutation in combination with T215S and L210S. The T215S mutation has been showed to be associated with reversion of zidovudine resistance. The T215S mutation was found in 1 additional patient. The subtype distribution was subtype B 59%, C 18%, A 8%, CRF02_AG 5%, CRF01_AE 4%, D 3% and G 2%. We found 2 patients (2%) with mutations associated with resistance in the RT-gene and none in the protease gene indicating a low prevalence of resistant HIV-1 in Denmark in the year 2000."
421,0.002,2.0,"Epstein-Barr virus DNA was analyzed from specimens of hairy leukoplakia, an oral lesion that occurs in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. The simultaneous presence of both type 1 and type 2 Epstein-Barr virus was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction assay. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the BamHI WYH region and in clones of the EcoRI C region suggested the presence of multiple strains of type 1 and type 2 viruses. The demonstration of multiple variably sized BamHI H fragments on Southern blot analysis and cloning of the EBNA-2 gene coding region also suggested the presence of multiple viral strains or variants coinfecting hairy leukoplakia. Recombination of the viral genome in and around the EBNA-2 gene apparently generated viral variants that replicated efficiently, one of which appeared to increase in abundance in a lesion over time. These data indicate that hairy leukoplakia involves coinfection with multiple strains of replicating Epstein-Barr virus and the endogenous generation of viral variants, some of which have mutations of the EBNA-2 gene."
7513,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk factors was evaluated by questionnaire survey in 1565 consecutive patients who attended an adult A&E department in Brisbane over a 2-month period. The survey revealed that a total of 144 (9.2%) patients could be considered at risk of HIV infection (high-risk group) because of known seropositivity, admission to HIV high-risk factors or engaging in high-risk activities. The remaining 1421 patients who did not acknowledge any high-risk behaviour were classified as an 'unknown-risk' group. More than 70% of the HIV high-risk patient group were under the age of 30 years. A total of 275 (17.6%) patients presented with open wounds and/or needed hospitalization (23 [1.5%] high-risk patients). Of the 490 respondents who engaged in short term sexual relationships, 310 (63.3%) practised unprotected coitus, 32 of these including four seropositives were classified in the high-risk group. The patients were asked if they were in favour of an HIV testing service at their local A&E department; 1324 (86.6%) were in agreement 121 of whom were in the high-risk group. There was no significant difference (chi 2 = 0.093: P greater than 0.7) in opinion between the 'unknown risk' and high-risk patient groups on this matter."
8762,0.002,2.0,"Abstract While the Internet has the potential to educate persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), websites may contain inaccurate information and increase the risk of nonadherence with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The objectives of our study were to determine the extent to which PLWHA engage in Internet health information seeking behavior (IHISB) and to determine whether IHISB is associated with ART adherence. We conducted a survey of adult, English-speaking HIV-infected patients at four HIV outpatient clinic sites in the United States (Baltimore, Maryland; Detroit, Michigan; New York, and Portland, Oregon) between December 2004 and January 2006. We assessed IHISB by asking participants how much information they had received from the Internet since acquiring HIV. The main outcome was patient-reported ART adherence over the past three days. Data were available on IHISB for 433 patients, 334 of whom were on ART therapy. Patients had a mean age of 45 (standard error [SE] 0.45) years and were mostly male (66%), African American (58%), and had attained a high school degree (73%). Most (55%) reported no IHISB, 18% reported some, and 27% reported ""a fair amount"" or ""a great deal."" Patients who reported higher versus lower levels of IHISB were significantly younger, had achieved a higher level of education, and had higher medication self-efficacy. In unadjusted analyses, higher IHISB was associated with ART adherence (odds ratio [OR], 2.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27-6.94). This association persisted after adjustment for age, gender, race, education, clinic site, and medication self-efficacy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.11-6.87). Our findings indicate that IHISB is positively associated with ART adherence even after controlling for potentially confounding variables. Future studies should investigate the ways in which Internet health information may promote medication adherence among PLWHA."
243,0.002,2.0,"Patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) have elevated risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) coinfection. Sequelae from coinfection include increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. This study synthesizes the results of trials measuring response to HAV vaccine in HIV-infected patients using Bayesian meta-analysis methodologies. PubMed, OhioLINK/Medline, and other sources were used to search for studies analyzing response to HAV vaccine in HIV-infected patients. Studies were evaluated for quality. A Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model was used to estimate overall response to vaccine. Between-study variance was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the potential for bias. The literature search yielded eight studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis, with a combined total of 458 patients. Observed proportions of response in individual studies ranged from 50 to 95%. The intention-to-treat meta-analysis estimated a combined proportion of HIV+ patients responding to vaccine of 64% (95% CI 52-75%). Heterogeneity between studies was significant. The overall response rate to HAV vaccine in HIV-infected patients is lower than typically cited. Up to 1/2 of HIV-infected patients may be nonresponders. Future research will be required to better understand the correlates of response."

9753,0.002,2.0,"Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the subsequent derangement of host immunity place affected patients at risk for secondary infections. Some of the secondary pathogens occur with such frequency or are so rare in the non-immunosuppressed population that they have become part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Other infectious agents not yet included in the CDC definition are being reported in the HIV-infected population with increased frequency. General observations of the degree of immunosuppression associated with specific secondary infections have been useful in developing classification systems for HIV disease such as that of the CDC. However, the specific alterations in host immunity that promote infection with specific secondary pathogens are generally unknown. Geographic differences in the types and frequency of secondary infections also have been reported. Variation in strains of HIV, effect of malnutrition, lack of appropriate medical treatment, prevalence of virulent infectious diseases, and epidemiologic differences are possible contributing factors. Some infections that seemed likely to be closely associated with HIV infection have not occurred more frequently in HIV-infected patients. This review summarizes the histopathology of infectious conditions in the current CDC classification and highlights some conditions seen in HIV-infected individuals that are not currently HIV/AIDS-defining infections, yet may be seen by practicing pathologists."
2787,0.002,2.0,"There is a complex interrelationship between human papillomaviruses (HPV) and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) that has been recognized from the start of the HIV epidemic. Cervical cancer was used as a surveillance indicator for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) before definitive identification of the viral etiology of either condition were known. Careful epidemiologic studies combined with clinical and laboratory measures of HPV, HPV-associated disease, and HIV have helped us understand many aspects of the relationship between these two virus groups; however, questions remain. The histopathology associated with HPV is identical in HIV-positive and negative patients though the lesions are more frequent, with higher frequency of multiple HPV types, and persistent in HIV infected individuals. In this review we will briefly explain the pathobiology of HPV in HIV-infected persons and the potential impact of secondary (screening) and primary (vaccination) prevention to reduce HPV-associated disease in those infected with HIV."

For 3,175 persons followed > or = 6 months after AIDS, we also examined the change between the year before AIDS diagnosis and the 6 months afterward in the predominant provider who was seen most frequently and at least twice. Approximately 75% of the population had a predominant provider identified. Of this group, 43% of the patients had a generalist as their predominant provider before AIDS diagnosis, falling to only 25% after diagnosis. The proportion with an AIDS specialist predominant provider increased from 22% before AIDS diagnosis to 39% afterward (P < 0.001). Patients with a generalist predominant provider before AIDS diagnosis had higher odds of switching providers and of hospitalization after AIDS diagnosis than patients with an AIDS specialist predominant provider. If generalists are to be encouraged to manage patients with advanced HIV disease, a better understanding of factors contributing to these outcomes is needed."

Each time patients were evaluated by physical examination, routine laboratory data, immunological and serological testing, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy and/or percutaneous liver biopsy. No patient of the study underwent immunosuppressive or antiviral treatment at any time.-The average time data in years are given as the median value (mean). Chronic hepatitis B: Histologic diagnoses and their long-term prognosis: Chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) on first biopsy: 10% of cases complete recovery after 15 years, 70% progression to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) after 5 years; CAH: 30% advanced remission/complete recovery 8 years after the first diagnosis of CAH, 40% progression to liver cirrhosis after 5 years; liver cirrhosis: 50% advanced remission/recovery 4 years after the first diagnosis of cirrhosis, 5% developed a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 11 years after the first diagnosis of cirrhosis. Natural history: In the 11 years following initial diagnosis of HBV-infection spontaneous recovery was observed in 49% of cases. In 3% of the patients the disease eventually caused death (1 x hemorrhage of oesophageal varices, 3x HCC after 14 to 20 years).

6858,0.002,2.0,"Herpes zoster (HZ) is a frequent complication of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on reconstitution of varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific cell-mediated immunity (VZV-CMI) in 56 VZV- and HIV-infected children. VZV-CMI did not change over the course of >/=3 years of observation, despite a reduction in HIV load. VZV-CMI correlated with lower HIV load but not with CD4 cell percentage. The incidence of HZ was unaffected by HAART. None of 5 patients who developed HZ during the study had VZV-CMI before developing HZ. After developing HZ, only the 2 HAART-compliant patients developed VZV-CMI. Thus, VZV-specific immune reconstitution in HIV infection may require antigenic reexposure, in addition to control of HIV replication."

Because of repeated flares, administration of lamivudine was started in March 2002. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA immediately decreased, but the serum level of alanine aminotransferase gradually increased. Drug-induced hepatitis due to lamivudine was excluded. It was suspected that the progression of liver damage was caused by hepatitis delta virus (HDV), because the patient was positive for both anti-HDV antibody and HDV RNA.

2793,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are two highly variable RNA viruses that cause chronic infections in humans. Although HCV likely preceded the AIDS epidemic by some decades, the global spread of both viruses is a relatively recent event. Nevertheless, HCV global diversity is higher than that of HIV-1. To identify differences in mutant diversity, we compared the HIV-1 protease and HCV NS3 protease quasispecies. Three protease gene quasispecies samples per virus, isolated from a total of six infected patients, were genetically and phenotypically analyzed at high resolution (HIV-1, 308 individual clones; HCV, 299 clones). Single-nucleotide variant frequency did not differ between quasispecies from the two viruses (HIV-1, 2.4 × 10(-3) ± 0.4 × 10(-3); HCV, 2.1 × 10(-3) ± 0.5 × 10(-3)) (P = 0.1680). The proportion of synonymous substitutions to potential synonymous sites was similar (3.667 ± 0.6667 and 2.183 ± 0.9048, respectively) (P = 0.2573), and Shannon's entropy values did not differ between HIV-1 and HCV (0.84 ± 0.02 and 0.83 ± 0.12, respectively) (P = 0.9408). Of note, 65% (HIV-1) and 67% (HCV) of the analyzed enzymes displayed detectable protease activity, suggesting that both proteases have a similar mutational robustness. In both viruses, there was a rugged protease enzymatic activity landscape characterized by a sharp peak, representing the master sequence, surrounded by a collection of diverse variants present at lower frequencies. These results indicate that nucleotide quasispecies diversification during chronic infection is not responsible for the higher worldwide genetic diversity observed in HCV."

2522,0.002,2.0,"The HBV in the sera of two chronic active hepatitis patients were analyzed for the promoter sequence heterogeneity. In most cases, the proportion of any particular clone in the total viral populations was less than 50%, showing high mutation rates. In contrast, promoter sequences of HBV from asymptomatic carriers revealed only a few point mutations with no deletions. HBV in chronic patient harbored variants with multiple mutations throughout promoters including 1762 (A-to-T), 1764 (G-to-A) double mutation in C promoter and deletions near CCAAT site in S promoter. Unlike other three promoter regions, C, pre-S1 and S, of HBV which revealed a high level of sequence heterogeneity, the X promoter region (from nt985 to 1430) showed little sequence heterogeneity within a patient. However, the predominant viral clones in two patients were quite different from each other. In addition to mutations in promoter regions, a deletion mutation in the translation start codon was also found in pre-S1 gene. The results in this report indicate that the mutation rates are not the same in all four promoters and that one of the strategies for maintaining persistent infection could be through mutations in viral promoters which then impair the balance of viral gene expressions."

9322,0.002,2.0,"The spectrum of pulmonary manifestations in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is broad, including many infectious and noninfectious complications. In the evaluation of an HIV-infected patient with diffuse pulmonary disease a definitive diagnosis is preferred over empiric therapy in most patients. Patients with focal consolidation usually receive empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, with nonresponders undergoing additional diagnostic testing. Bronchoscopy remains a cornerstone in the diagnostic evaluation. A multilobar bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and avoids the additional complications of hemorrhage and pneumothorax associated with transbronchial biopsy (TBBX). However, TBBX improves the sensitivity for diagnosis of tuberculosis and fungal pneumonias and is necessary to confirm invasive aspergillosis. Definitive criteria for diagnosis of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis have yet to be established, although bronchoscopic specimens usually are used. Tissue confirmation with TBBX is required for the diagnosis of noninfectious disorders such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lymphocytic and nonspecific pneumonitis. Bronchoscopic visualization of typical lesions often is sufficient for the presumptive diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) although the diagnostic yield is enhanced by the detection of human herpes virus 8 in BAL samples."
6119,0.002,2.0,"HIV infection induces alterations in almost all immune cell populations, mainly in CD4+ T cells, leading to the development of opportunistic infections. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) constitutes the most important site for viral replication, because the main target cells, memory T-cells, reside in this tissue. It is currently known that alterations in GALT are critical during the course of the infection, as HIV-1 induces loss of tissue integrity and promotes translocation of microbial products from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation, leading to a persistent immune activation state and immune exhaustion. Although antiretroviral treatment decreases viral load and substantially improves the prognosis of the infection, the alterations in GALT remains, having a great impact on the ability to establish effective immune responses. This emphasizes the importance of developing new therapeutic alternatives that may promote structural and functional integrity of this tissue. In this regard, therapy with probiotics/prebiotics has beneficial effects in GALT, mainly in syndromes characterized by intestinal dysbiosis, including the HIV-1 infection. In these patients, the consumption of probiotics/prebiotics decreased microbial products in plasma and CD4+ T cell activation, increased CD4+ T cell frequency, in particular Th17, and improved the intestinal flora. In this review, the most important findings on the potential impact of the probiotics/prebiotics therapy are discussed."
4427,0.002,2.0,"In recent years, it has become apparent that the lung is an important niche for the proliferation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which may have implications for highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

These cases of active pulmonary complications are direct indicators of enhanced progression to AIDS-defining illness and increased morbidity and mortality. It is therefore essential that the interaction between the lung and HIV is fully understood. Recent research indicates the lung may be a major sanctuary for the virus, with distinct evolution and replication in contrast to other target organs for HIV. In this review, we will discuss the recent findings of HIV infection, evolution, host factors involved in the control of HIV within the lung and the impact this may have on current therapy."

8601,0.002,2.0,"We compared the immune activation profile of 46 HIV-negative and 75 HIV-positive Israelis infected with HIV-1 subtype B, with 85 HIV-negative and 102 HIV-positive Ethiopian immigrants to Israel, who were infected with HIV subtype C. The HIV-negative Ethiopians had exceedingly high blood levels of eosinophils, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and p75s tumor-necrosis factor receptors (p75sTNFR); secretion of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC); proportion of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+ cells within CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T-cell subsets; and proportion of CD45RO+ CD4+ cells; while having significantly lower secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by PBMC and percentage of CD45RA+ CD4+ and CD28+ CD8+ cells. HIV infection in both populations was associated with reduced IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 secretion, number of CD28+ and CD45RA+ CD8+ cells, and increased number of HLA-DR+-CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells, and CD45RO+ CD8+ cells. Thus, infection with HIV-1 subtypes B and C of studied Israelis and Ethiopians, respectively, results in a similar immune activation profile at all stages of the infection when living in the same environment, despite the striking different immune profile observed in the HIV-negative Israeli and Ethiopian populations. Together with our previous observations, this indicates that HIV subtype is not a major determinant in the natural course of HIV infection."
198,0.002,2.0,"Antiviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) through daily drug administration can protect healthy individuals from HIV-1 infection. While PrEP was recently approved by the FDA, the potential long-term consequences of PrEP implementation remain entirely unclear. The aim of this study is to predict the efficacy of different prophylactic strategies with the pro-drug tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF) and to assess the sensitivity towards timing- and mode of TDF administration (daily- vs. single dose), adherence and the number of transmitted viruses. We developed a pharmacokinetic model for TDF and its active anabolite tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) and validated it with data from 4 different trials, including 4 distinct dosing regimes. Pharmacokinetics were coupled to an HIV model and viral decay following TDF mono-therapy was predicted, consistent with available data. Subsequently, a stochastic approach was used to estimate the % infections prevented by (i) daily TDF-based PrEP, (ii) one week TDF started either shortly before, or -after viral exposure and (iii) a single dose oral TDF before viral challenge (sd-PrEP). Analytical solutions were derived to assess the relation between intracellular TFV-DP concentrations and prophylactic efficacy. The predicted efficacy of TDF was limited by a slow accumulation of active compound (TFV-DP) and variable TFV-DP half-life and decreased with increasing numbers of transmitted viruses. Once daily TDF-based PrEP yielded [Formula: see text]80% protection, if at least 40% of pills were taken. Sd-PrEP with 300 mg or 600 mg TDF could prevent [Formula: see text]50% infections, when given at least before virus exposure. The efficacy dropped to [Formula: see text]10%, when given 1 h before 24 h exposure. Efficacy could not be increased with increasing dosage or prolonged administration. Post-exposure prophylaxis poorly prevented infection. The use of drugs that accumulate more rapidly, or local application of tenofovir gel may overcome the need for drug administration long before virus exposure."

Eleven criteria were described that result in a donor being designated at increased infectious risk. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission risk from an increased-risk donor (IRD), despite negative nucleic acid testing (NAT), likely varies based on behavior type and timing."
4853,0.002,2.0,"Asians are disproportionately affected by chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection and its fatal consequences. The Hep B Free campaign was launched to eliminate HBV in San Francisco by increasing awareness, testing, vaccination and linkage to care. The campaign conducted 306 street intercept and telephone interviews of San Francisco Asians to assess current levels of HBV knowledge, testing behaviors and effectiveness of existing campaign media materials. One-third of respondents ranked HBV as a key health issue in the Asian community, second to diabetes. General HBV awareness is high (85%); however, a majority could not name an effective prevention method. Sixty percent reported having been tested for HBV; provider recommendation was the most often cited reason for testing. Respondents reported a high level of trust in their providers to correctly assess which health issues they may be at risk for developing and test accordingly, confirming that efforts to increase HBV testing among Asians must simultaneously mobilize the public to request testing and compel providers to test high-risk patients. Regarding community awareness, more than half reported hearing more about HBV recently; younger respondents were more likely to have encountered campaign materials and recall correct HBV facts. Assessment of specific campaign materials found that while upbeat images and taglines captured attention and destigmatized HBV, messages that emphasize the pervasiveness and deadly consequence of infection were more likely to drive respondents to seek education and testing. The campaign used survey results to focus efforts on more intensive provider outreach and to create messages for a new public outreach media campaign."
4363,0.002,2.0,"To determine when the precore mutation at the 83rd nucleotide occurs, leading to the formation of a stop codon in the hepatitis B virus genome in carriers, which would indicate the presence of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), we investigated this mutation by direct sequencing and subcloning in 22 young hepatitis B antigen (HBeAg) (+) carriers. These subjects were 7-17 years old and were found during a survey for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in three elementary schools, a junior high, and a senior high school. None of these carriers had clinical manifestations, although one-third of them had elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels. All were HBeAg-positive by radioimmunoassay (RIA), and 6 of them had preserved titers of anti-HBe at the same time. Precore mutations were found in 4 subjects (18.2%), with predominance of the wild type. Although 3 of these 4 had preserved titers of HBeAb, the other had no HBeAb titers. In an other 3 subjects with preserved titers of HBeAb, the precore mutation was not detected, even after the subcloning of viral DNA. The remaining 15 subjects with HBeAg showed no precore mutation. Subjects with ALT levels exceeding 100 IU/l were all HBeAg-positive without the mutation. It was clear that the precore mutation itself occurred in the subjects at an early age during the course of infection. However, the chronological relationship between the emergence of the precore mutation and the onset of hepatitis requires further study."
2899,0.002,2.0,"Malnutrition characterized by weight loss and often extreme wasting generally develops when patients progress from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to AIDS. There is evidence that before the development of AIDS, HIV-infected patients without weight loss show early signs of malnutrition, defined as an increase in the ratio of extracellular mass (ECM) to body cell mass (BCM). As part of a dietary intervention study, body composition measurement were obtained at baseline and after 6 wk in 18 patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts between 140 and 740 cells/mm3. Only one patient had a prior weight loss (3.7 kg); patients gained 2 pounds after 3 wk of dietary supplementation of 500 kcal daily. Bioelectrical impedance was used to measured body compartments. The average ECM/BCM ratio (0.77 +/- 0.13) was within the normal range (0.83 +/- 0.16) indicating the absence of malnutrition by this criterion. Most measurements of BCM (kg) approximated normal values, while several for BCM (kg) exceeded normal. BCM (kg) correlated poorly with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.08; P = 0.11) in contrast to ECM (kg), which was well correlated (r2 = 0.82; P = 0.00). In addition, there was a significant correlation of body mass index (BMI) with the ECM/BCM ratio (r2 = 0.38; P = 0.00) and with ECM (r2 = 0.244; P = 0.003) indicating that overweight patients may be more likely to be considered malnourished than normal weight patients using this ratio. Without use of bioelectrical impedance, these subtle changes might be missed. Once significant weight loss has occurred coupled with decreases in BCM (kg), the ECM/BCM ratio may be more reflective of malnutrition. These conjectures will require prospective evaluation, but for now it seems reasonable to include bioelectrical impedance as a potentially useful tool in the evaluation of malnutrition in this population."
1372,0.002,2.0,"Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been increasing through promiscuous sexual contacts, and HBV genotype A (HBV/A) is frequent in patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) in Japan. To compare the geographic distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japan between 2005 and 2006 and between 2000 and 2001, with special attention to changes in the proportion of HBV/A, a cohort study was performed to survey changes in genotypes of CHB patients at 16 hospitals throughout Japan. Furthermore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of each genotype and examined the genomic characteristics of HBV/A isolates by molecular evolutionary analyses. Of the 1,271 patients, 3.5%, 14.1%, and 82.3% were infected with HBV/A, -B, and -C, respectively. In comparison with our previous survey during 2000 and 2001, HBV/A was twice as frequent (3.5% versus 1.7%; P = 0.02). The mean age was lower in the patients with HBV/A than in those with HBV/B or -C. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 11 full-length genomes and 29 pre-S2/S region sequences from patients, HBV/A isolates were imported from Europe and the United States, as well as the Philippines and India. They clustered with HBV/A from AHB patients and have spread throughout Japan. HBV/A has been increasing in CHB patients in Japan as a consequence of AHB spreading in the younger generation through promiscuous sexual contacts, aided by a tendency of HBV/A to induce chronic hepatitis. The spread of HBV/A infection in Japan should be prevented by universal vaccination programs."
2429,0.002,2.0,"A wide variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens can cause severe diarrhea in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The role of enteric viruses, especially rotaviruses, in HIV-related diarrhea is still unclear. One hundred and six stool samples from 66 HIV-infected patients with otherwise unexplained diarrhea and 35 samples from 35 patients with advanced HIV infection but without diarrhea were tested for the presence of rotavirus antigen. Rotavirus was detected in 13 samples from 9 patients with diarrhea and in none of the samples from patients without diarrhea. Two patients had recurrence of rotavirus infection more than 6 months after the first episode. Rotavirus was associated with prolonged diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal cramping. Symptoms were readily controlled with anti-diarrheal and pain-relieving measures. Illness was self-limited and did not require hospitalization. A seasonal variation, typical of infantile rotavirus infection, was not observed in this setting. While rotavirus infection has been infrequently detected in American HIV-infected patients, the prevalence in Australia and Europe appears to be considerably higher."
2329,0.002,2.0,"Despite considerable experience with single-dose, live, oral cholera vaccine CVD 103-HgR in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the vaccine had not been evaluated in sub-Saharan Africa or on individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We therefore conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial in 38 HIV-seropositive (without clinical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)) and 387 HIV-seronegative adults in Mali to assess its safety and immunogenicity. Adverse reactions (fever, diarrhoea and vomiting) were observed with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo recipients. The vaccine strain was not isolated from the coprocultures of any subject. The baseline geometric mean titre (GMT) of serum vibriocidal antibody was significantly lower in HIV-seropositives (1:23) than in HIV-seronegatives (1:65) (P = 0.002). Significant rises in vibriocidal antibody were observed in 71% of HIV-seronegatives and 58% of HIV-seropositives, and in 40% of HIV-seropositives with CD4+ counts below 500 per microliter. Following immunization, the peak vibriocidal GMT in HIV-seronegatives was 1:584 versus 1:124 in HIV-seropositives (P = 0.0006); in HIV-seropositives with CD4+ counts < 500 per microliter, the peak vibriocidal GMT was 1:40 (P = 0.03 versus other HIV-seropositives). CVD 103-HgR was safe in HIV-infected Malian adults, although serological responses were significantly attenuated among HIV-seropositives (particularly in those with CD4+ counts < 500 per microliter) relative to HIV-seronegatives. These results encourage further evaluations of this single-dose, oral cholera vaccine in high-risk populations such as refugees in sub-Saharan Africa."
5381,0.002,2.0,"Monocyte-derived macrophages were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), strain HIVBa-L, and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) strain AD 169. HCMV enhanced the production of p24 antigen and infectious HIV, but HIV had no effect on HCMV production. In dually infected cultures HIV p24 antigen levels were increased 5- to 15-fold during the first 3 weeks of culture. This enhancement was observed both for cell-associated and extracellular p24 antigen from co-infected cells. The replication of macrophage-tropic clinical isolates of HIV were also enhanced by HCMV, but HCMV did not enable T cell-tropic viruses to replicate in macrophages. Conversely, HCMV clinical isolates from blood or urine were able to upregulate HIV production. Similar enhancement of HIV p24 antigen levels was observed with noninfectious, heat-inactivated HCMV, indicating that replication of HCMV in the macrophages was not necessary. Although replication was not required, the enhancing ability of HCMV was associated with the virus. Enhancement of HIV segregated with the HCMV pelleted virus particles and not the supernatant in stock virus. The fact that HCMV and HIV are detected in macrophages in persons with HIV infection highlights the importance of this system for studying interactions between HIV and HCMV in persons with HIV infection."
4683,0.002,2.0,"Recombinant and synthetic peptides derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) genome corresponding to portions of the envelope (env) and internal core protein (gag) were examined for their immunoregulatory effects on the natural killer (NK) cell activity of lymphocytes from healthy donors and from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two recombinant peptides (env-gag and Env 80-DHFR) and three chemically synthesized peptides (env 487-511, env 578-608 and env 647-659) were used. Normal lymphocytes precultured for 24 to 72 hrs. with either env-gag, env 487-511, or env 647-659 at 5 and 50 ng/ml concentrations which significantly stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, produced significant suppression of NK activities. Two control peptides, one derived from the E. coli vector used to clone the HIV env-gag fusion peptide and another, a non-HIV-1 viral antigen (rubeola virus) did not produce any observable effect on NK activity of normal lymphocytes demonstrating the specificity of the reaction. Env-gag peptide also inhibited the NK activities of Percoll-separated, NK-enriched large granular lymphocytes. In target binding assays, lymphocytes precultured with env-gag significantly suppressed the target binding capacity of effector cells and produced significantly lower levels of natural killer cytotoxic factor (NKCF). In kinetic studies, lymphocytes from normal donors preincubated with env-gag for 24 to 72 hrs. produced significant inhibition of their NK activity and an even greater inhibitory effect on NK activities was observed when lymphocytes from AIDS patients were preincubated with HIV peptides. Thus HIV-1 peptides, which we previously demonstrated could regulate B- and T-lymphocyte activities, are also capable of regulating the NK activities of lymphocytes from HIV-1-infected and normal individuals."

9902,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen, a putative marker of virus load, was assayed in 79 blood and 83 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 90 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with or without dementia. Twenty-eight subjects had no evidence of neuropsychological impairment, 17 had mild impairment without objective evidence of dementia, and 45 were demented. HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently in CSF samples from demented (19/40) than normal (1/26) or mildly impaired (1/17) subjects and in 67% of individuals with significant dementia (MSK stages 2-4). p24 Antigen was detected less frequently in CSF from demented subjects on antiretroviral drugs than untreated demented individuals. Overall, the sensitivity of the antigen capture assay in CSF among demented individuals was 47.5%; the specificity, 95.0%; positive predictive value, 90.4%; negative predictive value, 66.1%; and the efficiency, 72.2%. A direct relationship was also noted between the degree of cognitive impairment and blood p24 antigen detection frequency and antigen concentration. CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts were lower for demented individuals, and HIV-1 p24 antigen was detected more frequently and p24 antigen concentration was higher in blood and CSF from individuals with low CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts. beta 2-Microglobulin levels were higher in CSF from demented subjects and correlated directly with CSF p24 antigen concentration. However, in contrast to CD4+ blood lymphocyte counts and beta 2-microglobulin levels, only p24 antigen concentration correlated with dementia severity. Therefore, p24 antigen can be a useful marker for dementia related to HIV-1 infection."
1025,0.002,2.0,"Enigmatic mechanisms restore the resting state in activated lymphocytes following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, rarely allowing persistent nonproductive infection. We detail a mechanism whereby cellular factors could establish virological latency. The transcription factors YY1 and LSF cooperate in repression of transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR). LSF recruits YY1 to the LTR via the zinc fingers of YY1. The first two zinc fingers were observed to be sufficient for this interaction in vitro. A mutant of LSF incapable of binding DNA blocked repression. Like other transcriptional repressors, YY1 can function via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC). We find that HDAC1 copurifies with the LTR-binding YY1-LSF repressor complex, the domain of YY1 that interacts with HDAC1 is required to repress the HIV-1 promoter, expression of HDAC1 augments repression of the LTR by YY1, and the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocks repression mediated by YY1. This novel link between HDAC recruitment and inhibition of HIV-1 expression by YY1 and LSF, in the natural context of a viral promoter integrated into chromosomal DNA, is the first demonstration of a molecular mechanism of repression of HIV-1. YY1 and LSF may establish transcriptional and virological latency of HIV, a state that has recently been recognized in vivo and has significant implications for the long-term treatment of AIDS."
5018,0.002,2.0,"The biopsychosocial challenges of living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have changed over time and they dictate the need for relevant medical services. The meaning of an HIV diagnosis has moved from a terminal to a manageable condition with the development of antiretrovirals, bringing profound changes to the experience of living with HIV and the meaning and use of diagnostic labels. Six biological stage-related categories in the literature of psychological medicine of HIV are critiqued. Long-term HIV highlights the inadequacy of physician-centred, acute-care medicine in chronic illness and its exclusion of preventive, psychological and rehabilitative modalities. 'Eupraxia' is presented as a conceptual framework for chronic care medicine, referring to best practice, wellbeing, best interests, and (public) welfare, through facilitated but collaborative approaches. A public-centred service model is proposed, using idiographic assessment and treatment by clinicians as patient delegates (proxies), monitoring joined-up care, providing group-based biopsychosocial treatment, facilitating autonomous and self-managing behaviour by the public, removing professional and practice hierarchies, and implementing real-time clinical and managerial accountability with public ownership and involvement. This model is superior in its health-and cost-effectiveness but can only work within a nationalized system that focuses equally on standardized outcomes and evidential and personalized health outcomes."
3763,0.002,2.0,"The objective of this study was to assess the analytical and clinical relevance of minority variants using a new pyrosequencing (PSQ) assay and to detect minor variants with frequencies below the current 20% clinical setting limit. A PSQ approach for detecting and quantifying mutations was developed for the analysis of 14 codons of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) gene below the limit of conventional sequencing. Ten patients who experienced virological failure (VF) after a first-line regimen of lamivudine, tenofovir, and either efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine, as well as 10 controls patients without VF, were included in this retrospective study. Baseline plasma and plasma from the time of VF were assessed using Sanger sequencing and PSQ methods. The analytical sensitivity for the detection of minor sequence variants is 5%. At baseline, no minority variant was detected in 10/10 patient controls using both the Sanger sequencing and PSQ assays, whereas, two patients who failed therapy had baseline non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) mutations that were not detected by the standard genotyping. At the time of VF, standard genotyping detected mutations in four out of the 10 VF patients, whereas, PSQ detected mutations in five out of the 10 VF patients. Clinically, minority mutations at a 10% level of detection can be assessed efficiently by pyrosequencing and used as a suitable predictor of the evolution of viral populations. These traits allow for a better interpretation of data analysis, which can help clinicians in providing a suitable treatment for HIV."

1410,0.002,2.0,"Despite the increased incidence of tuberculosis related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in recent decades, pancreatic tuberculosis has rarely been described. We report a case of pancreatic tuberculosis in a 39-year-old African man who presented with progressive dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss and productive cough, accompanied by localized epigastric pain and one episode of melena. HIV-1 testing was positive and lymphocyte subset profile showed CD(4) count of 9/mm(3). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a cystic mass in the body of the pancreas, significant portal and retroperitoneal cystic adenopathy, and multiple cystic lesions in the spleen and liver. CT guided cyst aspiration and node biopsy detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient responded well on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy. Tuberculosis rarely involves the pancreas, probably due to the presence of pancreatic enzymes which interfere with the seeding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Pancreatic tuberculosis is considered to be the result of dissemination of the infection from nearby lymphatic nodes. Endoscopic ultrasound or CT guided fine needle aspiration for cytology is the recommended diagnostic technique. Although the prognosis is good with anti-tuberculosis treatment, it could be fatal without correct diagnosis and treatment. The clinician's high index of suspicion of pancreatic tuberculosis and application of FNAB to obtain pathological evidence are extremely important to a correct diagnosis, especially in young HIV positive patients."

6386,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and analyze its determinants among Cambodian adults living with HIV/AIDS who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling to select 150 adults 18 years of age or older from the patient population at the HIV/AIDS care hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. QOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life HIV BREF; socio-demographic characteristics, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis, months on ART, CD4 cell count, family and community support, depression, and anxiety were included in the survey. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicate that positive predictors of QOL included being female, being less 40 years old, having a household monthly income greater than 300 USD, having an education beyond the secondary level, or being employed. However, time elapsed since HIV diagnosis and duration of ART were not significantly associated with QOL and CD4 cell count and the World Health Organization clinical stage had little association with QOL. Perceiving oneself as healthy and happy and reporting no depression or anxiety were associated with a positive QOL. These findings suggest the importance of group-specific interventions to improve the QOL for those people living with HIV/AIDS in Cambodia who are male, have a low household income or education level, are unemployed, or are anxious or depressed."
7628,0.002,2.0,"The 24-week extension of AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 359, a study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected, indinavir-experienced patients, was designed to study the durability of ""salvage"" treatment regimens. Patients received saquinavir in combination with either ritonavir or nelfinavir and, in addition, delavirdine, adefovir, or both. Patients who demonstrated a virologic response at weeks 12-16 were eligible to continue therapy in the extension through week 48. Of the 105 eligible subjects who were enrolled in the extension, 86 (82%) completed 48 weeks, and 49 (57%) of those 86 had HIV RNA levels <or=500 copies/mL at week 48. For these 86 subjects who completed 48 weeks, the median change in CD4 cell count from baseline was +72 cells/mm(3). Greater body weight, higher CD4 cell count, and greater degree of phenotypic susceptibility to indinavir and saquinavir at baseline were significantly associated with durable virologic suppression. These results show that some patients who experience treatment failure can demonstrate durable virologic and immunologic responses with salvage antiretroviral regimens."
5880,0.002,2.0,"The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among diarrhea, CD4+ cell counts and opportunistic protozoa in HIV-infected patients in North India. In a retrospective study, blood and stool samples of 200 HIV-infected patients from March 2001 until 2003, submitted to the AIDS division of National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), were analyzed. Each patient was examined for opportunistic protozoa, HIV-1 status and CD4+ cell counts, and screened for diarrheal symptoms. The rate of diarrhea was 38% in the stool examination. In HIV-infected patients in the groups CD4+ > 500 cells/microL, 200 cells/microL < CD4+ < 500 cells/muL and in the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL, diarrhea was 14.7, 29.8 and 56.1%, respectively. It is clear that the diarrhea in the AIDS patients was significant compared with the two former groups (P < 0.0005). In the AIDS patients CD4+ < 200 cells/microL with diarrhea, Cryptosporidium infection was, at 56.5%, the highest and statistically significant compared with the other parasites (P = 0.037). Microsporidium was detected in 30.4% of the AIDS patients. Diarrhea was common and most strongly associated in patients with low CD4+ cell counts. The data stress the importance of opportunistic protozoa in the HIV-infected patients, and that opportunistic protozoa should be expected in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ and diarrhea."
4980,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and hepatitis virus B or C (HBV, HCV) transmission are major risks following infusion of coagulation factor concentrates. Thus, several methods have been used to achieve viral inactivation of concentrates prepared from plasma collected from a large number of donors. In this study, 32 patients with haemophilia A or B (n = 31) or von Willebrand's disease (n = 1) were treated between 1987 and 1990 only with factor VIII or IX concentrates inactivated by the solvent-detergent procedure. During this period, none of these cases exhibited elevated liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase), and serological tests for HIV, HBV and HCV infections always remained negative. This suggests that the solvent-detergent procedure of concentrate inactivation is an efficient method to prevent not only HIV or HBV transmission but also HCV infection in haemophiliacs."
4814,0.002,2.0,"One goal of the HIV care continuum is achieving viral suppression (VS), yet disparities in suppression exist among subpopulations of HIV-infected persons. We sought to identify disparities in both the ability to achieve and sustain VS among an urban cohort of HIV-infected persons in care. Data from HIV-infected persons enrolled at the 13 DC Cohort study clinical sites between January 2011 and June 2014 were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were conducted to identify factors associated with achieving VS (viral load < 200 copies/ml) at least once, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with sustaining VS and time to virologic failure (VL ≥ 200 copies/ml after achievement of VS). Among the 4311 participants, 95.4% were either virally suppressed at study enrollment or able to achieve VS during the follow-up period. In multivariate analyses, achieving VS was significantly associated with age (aOR: 1.04; 95%CI: 1.03-1.06 per five-year increase) and having a higher CD4 (aOR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.06 per 100 cells/mm(3)). Patients infected through perinatal transmission were less likely to achieve VS compared to MSM patients (aOR: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51-0.79). Once achieved, most participants (74.4%) sustained VS during follow-up. Blacks and perinatally infected persons were less likely to have sustained VS in KM survival analysis (log rank chi-square p ≤ .001 for both) compared to other races and risk groups. Earlier time to failure was observed among females, Blacks, publically insured, perinatally infected, those with longer standing HIV infection, and those with diagnoses of mental health issues or depression. Among this HIV-infected cohort, most people achieved and maintained VS; however, disparities exist with regard to patient age, race, HIV transmission risk, and co-morbid conditions. Identifying populations with disparate outcomes allows for appropriate targeting of resources to improve outcomes along the care continuum."

3870,0.002,2.0,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has proved effective in prolonging survival and improving the quality of life of the people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). For the successful treatment of HIV infection, at least 95% adherence to HAART is required. This study sought to assess adherence to HAART and to identify factors enhancing adherence within the study population. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 428 patients attending the antiretroviral (ARV) clinic of the Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi. Self-reported adherence and other data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 and Epi6; and were exported into Systat 11 for multivariate logistic regression. There were 151 (35.3%) males and 277 (64.7%) females. The mean age was 36.7 +/- 9.6 years. Self-reported adherence rate was 268 (62.6%). The factor most predictive of adherence to HAART was availability of ARVs [OR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval 3.1-8.6; p < 0.001], followed by the ability to afford regular visits to the ARV clinic [OR = 1.7; 95% confidence interval 1.04-2.8; p = 0.034]. A recent diagnosis of HIV made less than 3 years prior to the study period was also significantly associated with adherence to HAART (chi2 = 8.94; p = 0.003). Availability of ARVs and ability to afford to regularly visit the clinic among other factors, positively influenced adherence to HAART among PLWHA. Efforts should be targeted at constant provision of free ARVs and early initiation of therapy for those requiring treatment, as well as ensuring regular adherence-education."
3132,0.002,2.0,"A Peruvian female prostitute population was evaluated over a 3-year period to determine the incidence and risk factors of retroviral and viral hepatitis transmission. At three survey periods, a questionnaire was administered and serum samples were obtained. A total of 966 subjects were studied, with 34% followed for 38 months, 22% followed for 18 months, and 44% evaluated just once. On initial evaluation, 3 (0.3%) had HIV-1 antibody, 170 (17.6%) had HTLV-I antibody, 578 (59.8%) had anti-HBc, and 7 (0.7%) had antibody to hepatitis C virus. The mean annual incidence of HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection was 1.6% and 4.7%, respectively. Univariate and logistic regression analysis of prevalence data indicated an association between sexual activity and HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection, but no independent risk factors were identified in cohort analysis. Parenteral risk factors were not associated with transmission, except for a small percentage of subjects who may have acquired hepatitis B infection from blood transfusions. These findings suggest that there is a high incidence of HTLV-I and hepatitis B infection from heterosexual contact in this female prostitute population."
9292,0.002,2.0,"To investigate the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance (TDR) among individuals with recent HIV-1 infection between February 2004 and January 2010 in a rural clinical cohort, samples from 72 participants were analyzed. Results from the 72 participants showed no protease inhibitor and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-associated mutations. One participant (1.4%, 95% CI: 0.04-7.5%) had two nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations (G190E and P225H). HIV-1 subtype frequencies were A 22 (30.6%), D 38 (52.8%), and C 1 (1.4%); 11 (15.3%) were A/D unique recombinant forms. Seven years after the scale up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a rural clinical cohort in Uganda, the prevalence of TDR among recently HIV-1-infected individuals was low at 1.4%. Since our findings from an HIV study cohort may not be generalizable to the general population, routine TDR surveys in specific populations may be necessary to inform policy on the magnitude and prevention strategies of TDR."
4827,0.002,2.0,"An analysis of the ecological association between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis was undertaken using joint mapping modelling based on data from South African national HIV and syphilis sentinel surveillance surveys carried out between 2007 and 2009. The syphilis prevalence, taken as proxy for sexual behaviour and increased HIV transmission, was first used with health district-level deprivation and population density as a covariate in a HIV prevalence spatial regression model and, secondly, together with HIV as a bivariate outcome. HIV is more highly prevalent in deprived and populated areas than elsewhere, while syphilis has a high prevalence in less deprived and less populated areas. Spatially, the HIV prevalence was lowest in the southwestern and highest in the northeastern parts of the country. This was in discordance to the syphilis prevalence, which revealed negative correlations with HIV prevalence. Considerable variations across the districts remained after adjusting for the contextual covariate factors. Divergent spatial patterns between HIV and syphilis were identified, regarding both observed and unobserved covariate effects. The differential disease-specific spatial prevalence patterns may point to inconsistent successes in interventions between the two diseases. Overall, the results emphasize the need to develop and test plausible aetiological hypotheses relating to ecological correlations and causes of the disease-specific interjectory between the districts."
4778,0.002,2.0,"This study was undertaken in order to determine whether screening of viremic blood donations by testing of pooled donor samples could constitute a technically feasible transfusional safety measure. A pilot study of real-time simulation, on a day-to-day basis, of screening of three viral genomes (hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) was conducted by five French Blood Centers on plasma samples collected from blood donors and studied within undiluted samples and within sample pools of various sizes. This study was carried out within time conditions compatible with the release of platelets. For the detection of HCV and HIV genomes, the five laboratories achieved a sensitivity that decreased with the size of the sample pool. Four were successful in detecting all undiluted samples. In the 1/10 diluted samples, four failed to detect one HIV or HCV sample. In the 1/100 diluted samples, all laboratories failed to detect one or more HIV or HCV samples. For HBV genome, no participating laboratories detected all of the samples of the panel, even undiluted samples, and the sample pooling considerably affected sensitivity. The improvement and standardization of assays needs to be attained, and training of laboratories appears to be a step crucial for routine screening of viral genomes in blood donations."
7492,0.002,2.0,"A prevalence study of 2072 male US shipboard military personnel scheduled for deployment to South America/West Africa and the Mediterranean was conducted to determine whether serologic evidence of prior hepatitis A, B, or C infection is associated with exposure in foreign countries. There were 210 subjects (10.1%) who had antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV), 76 (3.7%) to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and 9 (0.4%) to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). By multivariate analysis, anti-HAV seropositivity was independently associated with age, non-white racial/ethnic groups, birth outside of the United States, and prior Caribbean deployment for less than 1 year. Anti-HBc seropositivity was independently associated with black and Filipino race/ethnicity, foreign birth, a history of a sexually transmitted disease, South Pacific/Indian Ocean deployment (less than 12 months), and South Pacific or Mediterranean duty for (greater than 1 year). No geographic risk factors were associated with anti-HCV positivity. These data indicate that military personnel deployed outside the United States are at increased risk of viral hepatitis infection and should be considered for vaccination."
2419,0.002,2.0,"Before December 1997, in Espírito Santo, Brazil, combination antiretroviral therapy was used without routine virologic or immunologic monitoring. To examine consequences of therapy in this setting, clinical information, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels, CD4 cell counts, and protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were determined for consecutive HIV-1-infected outpatients. Of 48 treatment-naive individuals, 11 were started on therapy for HIV-related symptoms; however, 44 (92%) had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL, a CD4 cell count <500/mm3, or symptoms. Eighteen (51%) of 35 patients on therapy had an RNA level >20,000 copies/mL. Nucleoside-resistance mutations were observed in 21 (68%) of 31 nucleoside-experienced subjects. Protease mutations necessary for high-level protease inhibitor (PI) resistance were present together with permissive mutations in 3 of 10 PI-experienced patients. Inability to identify high-risk individuals and to detect virologic failure may limit the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug programs and may promote the spread of drug resistance where virologic and immunologic monitoring are not available."
7334,0.002,2.0,"Red blood cell (RBC) deformability is a major determinant of the ability of the RBC to pass repeatedly through the microcirculation. A decrease in RBC deformability leads to tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to measure the rigidity of RBCs from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive individuals and investigate its relation to immune status and viral load. A filtration method based on the initial flow rate principle was used to determine the index of rigidity (IR) of 53 samples from HIV patients and 53 healthy individuals. The mean IR was significantly increased in patients with HIV compared to healthy individuals (P < 0.01). IR was inversely correlated with current CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (P < 0.0001). High CD4 cell counts (>200 cells/microl) are related to low IR values, independently of the viral load (VL). No differences in rigidity were noted between the VL groups, although there was a trend towards an increased IR in patients with high VL within the group of CD4<200. RBC deformability is decreased in HIV disease, in a degree mainly related to CD4 depletion. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the role of VL in highly immunocompromised HIV patients."
2260,0.002,2.0,"In recent years, novel antiretroviral drugs have become available for multi-experienced HIV-infected patients with limited options. We enrolled seven advanced HIV-patients, failing multiple previous HAART regimens, in virological failure on their current HAART regimen and showing recent clinical and immunological progression. All patients were prescribed a double-boosted tipranavir plus enfuvirtide based regimen, in addition to zidovudine, tenofovir and lamivudine for salvage therapy. To assess susceptibility to tipranavir, the tipranavir genotypic resistance score was calculated and two years later this was re-evaluated on an updated tipranavir genotypic score algorithm. At baseline, CD4 were 139/mcL (more or less 145), HIV-1 RNA was 822,700 cp/mL. All patients achieved HIV-1 RNA levels less than 400 cp/mL between 12 weeks and 24 weeks of observation; two reached less than 50 cp/mL during this period. At 48 weeks three patients had reached less than 50 cp/mL; three other patients had HIV RNA less than 200 cp/mL. At 72 and 96 weeks HIV viraemia was less than 50 cp/mL in six patients; CD4 T-cell counts 285/mcL (more o less 198). No AIDS-defining events were recorded. Adverse events did not need to stop or change HAART. Strong 3 NRTI backbone could help efficacy and durability, and frequent evaluations in complex patients can help to manage toxicity."
8839,0.002,2.0,"To perform a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plaque assay in nonadherent host cells, we developed a novel technique in which HIV-infected MT-2 cells were formed into monolayers by centrifugation through molten agarose. Infection, formation of cell monolayers, and enumeration of plaques all took place in 96-well microtiter plates. When this process was preceded by 18 h of incubation of HIV with patient serum samples, neutralizing antibody titers between 1:10 and 1:5,000 could be accurately determined in patient serum samples. In addition to the determination of neutralizing antibody titers (with the use of various serum dilutions and a constant virus concentration), neutralization indices could also be determined with different virus dilutions and a single dilution of patient serum."
10009,0.002,2.0,"We report a case of Fanconi syndrome associated with the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor used in the treatment of HIV infection. A 56-year-old HIV-infected man was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of severe, progressive weakness. His HIV infection was well controlled by antiretroviral therapy; other medical problems included hepatitis C and chronic renal insufficiency. About 2 weeks before presentation, the patient had received an influenza vaccination, which was followed by a generalized viral syndrome of several days' duration. Next, weakness developed and culminated in an inability to walk; this prompted the patient's presentation at the hospital. Urine chemistry, electrolyte panel, and clinical presentation were consistent with Fanconi syndrome, a generalized proximal tubular dysfunction involving proteins, glucose, uric acid, and electrolytes. Along with our Case Report, we review 25 cases of Fanconi syndrome previously reported in the literature."
7419,0.002,2.0,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection is emerging as an important complication in HIV infection and AIDS in injecting drug users. HIV-1 and HTLV-I share a common host in CD4+ T lymphocytes. However, the result of HIV-1 infection is the decimation of this cell population, whereas a hallmark of HTLV-I infection is the inappropriate proliferation of infected cells. Combined epidemiologic data suggest that HTLV-I infection is enhanced during concurrent HIV-1/HTLV-I infection; however, there are currently no in vitro studies focusing on the effects of drugs of abuse on retrovirus coinfection. We have found that in an in vitro coinfection system (HIV-1 + HTLV-I), morphine treatment further enhanced the levels of HTLV-I p19. In addition, indicators of in vitro infection by cell-free HIV-1 were reduced by morphine treatment in both single and dual in vitro infection experiments. Interleukin 2 levels in the affected cultures were found to increase with combined HTLV-I infection and morphine treatment. These in vitro results indicate the need to further explore the activity of HTLV-I within opiate-treated cells, as this oncoretrovirus appears to be especially sensitive to morphine-induced alterations to its host cell environment."
2834,0.002,2.0,"Integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA in the nuclear genome is catalyzed by the retroviral integrase (IN). In addition to IN, viral and cellular proteins associated in the high-molecular-weight preintegration complex have been suggested to be involved in this process. In an attempt to define host factors interacting with IN, we used an in vitro system to identify cellular proteins in interaction with HIV-1 IN. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was chosen since (i) its complete sequence has been established and the primary structure of all the putative proteins from this eucaryote has been deduced, (ii) there is a significant degree of homology between human and yeast proteins, and (iii) we have previously shown that the expression of HIV-1 IN in yeast induces a lethal phenotype. Strong evidences suggest that this lethality is linked to IN activity in infected human cells where integration requires the cleavage of genomic DNA. Using IN-affinity chromatography we identified four yeast proteins interacting with HIV-1 IN, including the yeast chaperonin yHSP60, which is the counterpart of human hHSP60. Yeast lethality induced by HIV-1 IN was abolished when a mutated HSP60 was coexpressed, therefore suggesting that both proteins interact in vivo. Besides interacting with HIV-1 IN, the hHSP60 was able to stimulate the in vitro processing and joining activities of IN and protected this enzyme from thermal denaturation. In addition, the functional human HSP60-HSP10 complex in the presence of ATP was able to recognize the HIV-1 IN as a substrate."
2760,0.002,2.0,"Sera collected for syphilis screening from pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at Debretabor rural hospital, north west Ethiopia were tested for HIV infection with the objective of assessing HIV prevalence and the relationship between syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity. A total of 270 pregnant women who visited antenatal clinics from June to September, 1994 were included in the study. Socio-demographic characteristics of the women were retrieved from antenatal care cards. Sera were screened for syphilis and HIV infection by VDRL and ELISA tests respectively. Twenty nine pregnant women (10.7%) were found to be HIV positive. Those living in other villages and rural towns appeared to have a low risk (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.8) of acquiring HIV infection when compared to those living in Debretabor town. Women who were seropositive for syphilis were twice as likely to be positive for HIV. Prevention of HIV transmission to women and infants is a priority health and social concern. Prevention and early recognition and treatment of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) will be important factors in the prevention and control of HIV transmission."
1477,0.002,2.0,"Few studies have surveyed HIV-infected patients to determine how adequately medical, legal, psychological, social service, and financial needs are being met through current treatment services. Fifty HIV-infected men seen at a county medical facility were surveyed to determine which of 17 needs were being met and the importance rating attributed to those needs. Five needs were reported by more than 30% of the sample as not being met: 1) being able to talk about fears of the future, illness, or death; 2) being occupied and having things to do; 3) having up-to-date information about HIV; 4) having someone to help them with their feelings of depression, helplessness, anxiety, or anger; and 5) help for the patient's family. Three of these five needs involve better access to psychological services. Although patients felt they had knowledgeable medical staff and good health care, they wanted more up-to-date information on HIV treatment."
3813,0.002,2.0,"SIV/HIV-1 (SHIV) chimeric clones, constructed by substituting portions of the pathogenic molecular clone SIVmac239 with counterpart portions from HIV-1 clones, provide a means to analyze functions of selected HIV-1 genes in vivo in nonhuman primates. Our studies focused on SHIVSF33, which contains the vpu, tat, rev, and env genes of the cytopathic, T-cell line tropic clone HIV-1sf33 (subtype-B); this clone has a premature stop codon in the vpu gene. In three juvenile macaques inoculated intravenously with SHIVSF33, low-level persistent infection was established; no disease was observed for a period of >2 years. However, at approximately 16 months p.i., one of four SHIVSF33-infected juvenile macaques exhibited an increase in virus load, depletion of CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood and lymph nodes, and other symptoms of simian AIDS (SAIDS). Virus recovered from this animal in the symptomatic stage was designated SHIVSF33a (A, adapted); this virus displayed multiple amino acid sequence changes throughout the HIV-1 env gene compared with the input SHIVSF33 clone. Additionally, a mutation in all clones from SHIVSF33a restored the open reading frame for the vpu gene. In vitro evaluations in tissue-culture systems revealed that SHIVSF33a replicated to higher levels and exhibited greater cytopathicity than SHIVSF33. Furthermore cloned env genes for SHIVSF33a were more fusogenic in a cell-fusion assay compared with the env gene of the SHIVSF33. Intravenous inoculation of SHIVsf33a into juvenile and newborn macaques resulted in a rapid decline in CD4(+) T cells to very low levels and development of a fatal AIDS-like disease. A cell-free preparation of this pathogenic chimeric virus also established persistent infection when applied to oral mucosal membranes of juvenile macaques and produced a fatal AIDS-like disease. These studies on pathogenic SHIVSF33a establish the basis for further investigations on the role of the HIV-1 env gene in virus adaptation and in mechanism(s) of immunodeficiency in primates; moreover, the chimeric virus SHIVSF33a can play a role in elucidating mucosal membrane transmission and development of antiviral vaccines in newborns as well as juvenile and adult macaques."
118,0.002,2.0,Coinfection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a substantial medical and public health concern due to its increasing prevalence and complex patient management. Alcohol use may worsen HCV-related liver disease and interfere with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical care. We therefore studied the association between HCV infection and markers of HIV disease progression in adults with alcohol problems.
1089,0.002,2.0,"The 9-month-old daughter of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive parents presented with cholestasis and was found on liver biopsy to have giant cell hepatitis. No viral inclusions or particles were seen by light or electron microscopy. Ultrastructural studies of the liver biopsy demonstrated tubuloreticular structures in the endothelium and cylindrical confronting cisternae in inflammatory cells in the portal tracts. Serologic studies for hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and Epstein-Barr viruses were negative. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was cultured from the urine, but buffy coat, nasopharyngeal, and liver cultures were negative and CMV antibody titer was low. The hepatitis responded dramatically to prednisone therapy. A repeat biopsy several months later revealed similar morphologic findings. AIDS was suspected on clinical and immunologic grounds, and was confirmed by the demonstration of HIV-specific IgG and IgM in serum. Five months after initial presentation, the infant developed Pneumocystis pneumonia, disseminated CMV infection, and died. This appears to be the first reported association of infantile giant cell hepatitis with HIV infection."
4084,0.002,2.0,"The rate of progression to disease varies considerably among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1). Analyses of semiannual blood samples obtained from six infected men showed that a rapid rate of CD4 T cell loss was associated with relative evolutionary stasis of the HIV-1 quasispecies virus population. More moderate rates of CD4 T cell loss correlated with genetic evolution within three of four subjects. Consistent with selection by the immune constraints of these subjects, amino acid changes were apparent within the appropriate epitopes of human leukocyte antigen class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Thus, the evolutionary dynamics exhibited by the HIV-1 quasispecies virus populations under natural selection are compatible with adaptive evolution."
388,0.002,2.0,"This study assessed the prevalence of and correlated factors for chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV) among HIV patients attending the Reference Center for Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and AIDS in Vitória, ES, Brazil. HIV patients were studied from 1993 to 2004, using information recorded in a database of the STI Clinic. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, patterns of risk behavior and test results (ELISA-HIV, IFA-HIV, HBsAg, viral load and CD4 counts) were analyzed. We analyzed 851 HIV patients. Median age was 35.0 (interquartile range 30; 42) years and median years of education was 8.0 (IQR 5; 11). The prevalence of chronic HBV was 3.8% (95% CI 2.5-5.1). Illicit drug use was reported in 185 (21.7%) cases, alcohol abuse in 80 (9.4%) cases, men who have sex with men in 116 (13.6%) cases, and past STI in 320 (37.6%) cases. Chronic HBV was associated with intravenous drug use, male gender, STI associated with HIV diagnosis, and death. There is a need for prevention and assistance strategies to control the evolution of this infection in HIV patients."
7216,0.002,2.0,"We determined the susceptibility to antiviral drugs of clinical isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtypes A, B, C, D, and E. Isolates from treated and untreated patients were tested for sensitivity to zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), didanosine (ddI), nevirapine (NVP), foscarnet (PFA), and ritonavir (RNV). The susceptibility to these different drugs was broadly similar between the different subtypes of HIV-1. Isolates of subtype D showed a tendency toward slightly lower susceptibility to all the antiviral drugs, which could be related to the rapid growth characteristics of these isolates."
8879,0.002,2.0,"A total of 144 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients (mean CD4 cell count, 367 cells/mm3) were included in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy on surrogate markers of HIV progression of the combination didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine or DDI) plus stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine or D4T) with or without hydroxyurea. The primary end point was a reduction of HIV RNA levels to below 200 copies/ml after 12 weeks of treatment. The results showed that the triple combination was associated with a more profound decrease in HIV RNA with an increased proportion of patients with viraemia < 200 copies/ml. This effect persisted for the majority of the patients after a 48 week follow-up. In contrast, the increase in CD4 cell counts was less in patients treated with hydroxyurea because of lymphopenia, and adverse events were more frequent in hydroxyurea-treated patients. In conclusion, the addition of hydroxyurea consistently improved the antiviral activity of the didanosine/stavudine combination over a 48 week follow-up. Increased toxicity and decreased effect on CD4 cell counts might inspire caution."
489,0.002,2.0,"The current guidelines for the use of antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria places emphasis on the use of CD4+ enumeration to take decision of initiating antiretroviral therapy and HIV disease monitoring. CD4+ counts are known to be inherently inconsistent and therefore could be misleading. This study was undertaken to analyze the CD4+/CD8+ ratio vis-à-vis CD4+ in HIV-1 infected individual in North Central Nigeria and to correlate these immunological parameters to AIDS event and death in relation to gender and age of patients. Cell counts were carried out using a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) that quantifies CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes as absolute numbers of lymphocytes per microL of blood and the CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio recorded in an automated fashion. A total of 290 HIV-1 positive persons were enrolled for this study. The median CD4+/CD8+ ratio were 0.05, 0.27, 0.64 in patients with CD4+ counts of < 50, 51-200, > 350 respectively. CD4+/ CD8+ of 0.05 and 0.27 were corresponding predictors of AIDS-related event and death. Patients with > 0.64 are predictive of better disease prognosis and low progression to AIDS. The CD4+/CD8+ were minimally higher in female patients with a median CD4+/CD8 ratio of 0.27. The age distribution of our patients at point of first entry was not found to influence CD4+/CD8+ ratios. These findings provide basic and critical CD4+/CD8+ cut-off values in predicting HIV disease progression and an alternative to absolute CD4+ counts at predicting the onset of HIV related disease. These data are useful to determine when intervention with antiretroviral therapy is needed and to determine the likelihood of virological failure."
3916,0.002,2.0,"Numerous African primates are infected with simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs). It is now well established that the clade of SIVs infecting west-central African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) represent the progenitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), whereas HIV-2 results from different cross-species transmissions of SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys atys). We present here the first molecular epidemiological survey of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVwrc) in wild-living western red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus badius badius) which are frequently hunted by the human population and represent a favourite prey of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). We collected faecal samples (n=88) and we assessed individual discrimination by microsatellite analyses and visual observation. We tested the inferred 53 adult individuals belonging to two neighbouring habituated groups for presence of SIVwrc infection by viral RNA (vRNA) detection. We amplified viral polymerase (pol) (650 bp) and/or envelope (env) (570 bp) sequences in 14 individuals, resulting in a minimal prevalence of 26% among the individuals sampled, possibly reaching 50% when considering the relatively low sensitivity of viral RNA detection in faecal samples. With a few exceptions, phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences revealed a low degree of intragroup genetic diversity and a general viral clustering related to the social group of origin. However, we found a higher intergroup diversity. Behavioural and demographic data collected previously from these communities indicate that red colobus monkeys live in promiscuous multi-male societies, where females leave their natal group at the sub-adult stage of their lives and where extra-group copulations or male immigration have been rarely observed. The phylogenetic data we obtained seem to reflect these behavioural characteristics. Overall, our results indicate that wild-living red colobus represent a substantial reservoir of SIVwrc. Moreover, because of their frequent association with other monkey species, the predation pressure exerted by chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and by poachers around and inside the park, simian to simian and simian to human SIVwrc cross-species transmission cannot be excluded."
7893,0.002,2.0,"We have evaluated the use of an ultrasensitive reverse transcriptase (RT) activity assay to monitor plasma viremia in two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) group O-infected patients treated with stavudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. After a initial decline in RT levels observed at 4 weeks of therapy, RT-based plasma viremia returned to baseline values at 28 or 44 weeks of treatment. The rebound in levels of RT activity was associated with the detection of phenotypic resistance to lamivudine and with the Met184Val mutation. Analysis of RT activity in plasma provides a sequence-independent means of monitoring virus loads in HIV-1 group O-infected patients."
6543,0.002,2.0,"Emtricitabine (FTC) is a new nucleoside agent that has activity against both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus. It is very similar to lamivudine (3TC) with respect to its activity, convenience, and safety and resistance profile. Indeed, with the exception of the longer intracellular half-life of triphosphate FTC, there is little to distinguish between the 2 drugs. Clinical trials comparing FTC with 3TC as part of a triple-drug regimen have demonstrated their equivalence, whereas a study comparing activity of FTC with that of stavudine demonstrated FTC's superiority. In clinical practice, the choice of 3TC versus FTC will most likely be made in the context of drugs coformulated with them. Although FTC is not formally approved for use in patients coinfected with HIV and hepatitis B virus, it is often a preferred choice for such patients when combined with tenofovir, which also has anti-hepatitis B virus activity. Recent treatment guidelines for the treatment of HIV infection by both the International AIDS Society-USA and US Department of Health and Human Services have placed FTC in combination with tenofovir, didanosine, or zidovudine in the preferred category of nucleoside backbone regimens for patients receiving antiretroviral therapy."
5841,0.002,2.0,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) continues to be an important public health problem worldwide, including in the United States. An algorithm for managing CHB was developed by a panel of United States hepatologists in 2004 and subsequently updated in 2006 and 2008. Since 2008, additional data on long-term safety and efficacy of licensed therapies have become available and have better defined therapeutic options for CHB. The evidence indicates that potent antiviral therapy can lead to regression of extensive fibrosis or even cirrhosis, thus potentially altering the natural history of CHB. In addition, appropriate choice of antiviral agent can minimize the risk of resistance. This updated algorithm for managing CHB is based primarily on evidence from the scientific literature. Where data were lacking, the panel relied on clinical experience and consensus expert opinion. The primary aim of antiviral therapy for CHB is durable suppression of serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to low or undetectable levels. CHB patients who have HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, and any degree of fibrosis should receive antiviral therapy regardless of their hepatitis B e antigen status. CHB patients with HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL and elevated alanine aminotransferase level but no evidence of fibrosis may also be considered for antiviral therapy. Approved antiviral therapies for CHB are interferon alfa-2b, peginterferon alfa-2a, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, although the preferred first-line treatment choices are peginterferon alfa-2a, entecavir, and tenofovir. In determining choice of therapy, considerations include efficacy, safety, rate of resistance, method of administration, duration, and cost. "

In the natural history of chronic hepatitis B infection, HBeAg marks the first two of the four phases, namely the immune tolerant phase and the immune clearance phase, and is associated with highly replicative activity of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Most HBV consensus reports and guidelines recommend antiviral therapy if the immune clearance phase is prolonged and if there is evidence of significant necroinflammation and fibrosis. Two main types of antiviral agents have been approved for treating patients in the immune clearance phase: interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs). The endpoints of therapy are viral suppression with HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable serum HBV DNA, normalization of serum alanine transaminase and improvement in the histological necroinflammatory and fibrosis scores. The ultimate goal of therapy is to obtain clinical benefit for the patient by reducing complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The choice between interferon-based immune modulators or NUCs that target the HBV DNA polymerase must be carefully weighed on an individual basis. Therapy with NUCs is often preferred by doctors and patients because it is easy to administer, with predictable efficacy and minimal side-effects. In specific patient subgroups such as those with decompensated disease, poor predictors of response or lack of response to interferon-based therapy and/or significant comorbidities that cannot tolerate interferon-induced side effects, NUCs therapy is the obvious choice. Entecavir and tenofovir are the treatments of choice because their efficacy and safety profile are better than lamivudine, adefovir and telbivudine. More importantly, there is a minimal risk of drug resistance during long-term therapy with these agents."
6423,0.002,2.0,Effective therapies and reduced AIDS-related morbidity and mortality have shifted the focus in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from minimizing short-term disease progression to maintaining optimal long-term health. We describe the effects of children's age and pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) CD4 count on long-term CD4 T-cell reconstitution.
8333,0.002,2.0,"The major target of the neutralizing antibody response to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the outer envelope glycoprotein, gp120. The spectrum of HIV-1 neutralization specificity is currently represented by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be divided broadly into five groups. We have studied the binding of these mAbs to functional oligomeric and soluble monomeric gp120 derived from the molecular clone of a cell line-adapted isolate of HIV-1, and compared these binding properties with virus neutralization. Binding of all mAbs except those reactive with the V3 loop was much weaker to oligomeric than to monomeric gp120. This reduction in binding to oligomeric gp120 was determined mostly by a slower relative rate of association, although the dissociation rate also had some influence on relative variation in mAb affinity. Virus neutralization correlated broadly with mAb binding to the oligomeric rather than to the monomeric form of gp120, and neutralization potency was related to the estimated association rate. Thus, with the exception of the hypervariable V3 loop, regions of HIV-1 gp120 with the potential to induce a neutralization response are likely to be poorly presented for antibody recognition on the surface of cell line-adapted virions."
3628,0.002,2.0,"Mannan sulfate, a novel sulfated polysaccharide, was prepared and investigated for its activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vitro. Mannan sulfate completely inhibited HIV-1-induced cell destruction and viral antigen expression in HIV-1-infected Molt-4 (clone 8) cells at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml. The 50% antiviral effective doses obtained with mannan sulfate in Molt-4 (clone 8) cells and in MT-4 cells were 1.5 and 9.3 micrograms/ml, respectively. No toxicity for Molt-4 (clone 8) cells or MT-4 cells was observed at a concentration of 4,000 and 2,500 micrograms/ml, respectively. Mannan sulfate was also inhibitory to other enveloped viruses, i.e. herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. These results suggest that mannan sulfate may be useful for the chemotherapy of various viral infections, including those causing and associated with AIDS."
2002,0.002,2.0,"The monocytoid tumor cell line U-937 and five derived subclones were infected with the HTLV-IIIB isolate of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Susceptibility to infection and sensitivity to the cytopathic effects correlated with the expression of the T4 antigen on the cell surface. On the basis of these characteristics the lines could be divided into three groups. Less than 10% T4 positive cells were present in the parental line and clone 4; hence productive infection could only be established after a long latency or with a high virus inoculum. These lines showed no or only marginal cytopathic effect. Clone 16 contained more than 95% T4 positive cells and was the most sensitive line to infection with HTLV-IIIB and its cytopathic effect. Cell death was so extensive following infection that no continuous virus producer line could ever be established from clone 16 cells. Cultures with intermediate T4 expression (50-70% T4+ cells) also had intermediate susceptibility to virus infection. Cytopathic changes, even if pronounced, could be overcome in the infected cultures by the addition of uninfected cells and, in each case, a producer line could be established. HTLV-IIIB infection of clone 16 cells could be blocked by preincubation with monoclonal anti-T4 antibodies indicating a close similarity between the HTLV-IIIB receptor on T4 positive T cells and monocytoid cells. The results thus show that T4 positive monocytoid cells can function as target cells for the HIV."
197,0.002,2.0,"Clarifying the relationship between illicit drug use and HIV-1 virologic suppression requires characterization of both illicit drug use activity and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We developed a rapid clinical questionnaire to assess prior 7-day illicit drug use and ART adherence in a cross-sectional study among 1777 HIV-infected persons in care. Of these, 76% were male, 35% were African-American, and 8% reported injection drug use as their probable route of HIV-1 infection. Questionnaire-reported frequencies of cocaine and marijuana use within the previous 7 days were 3.3% and 12.1%, respectively. Over three quarters (77.8%) of participants were on ART, of whom 69.7% had HIV-1 virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA<48 copies/mL). Univariate analyses revealed that compared to no use, cocaine and marijuana use were both associated with missed ART doses (P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusting for nonadherence demonstrated that cocaine use was independently associated with failing to achieve virologic suppression (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.46; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.22-0.98) but marijuana use was not (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.72-1.62). This result strengthens the evidence of a direct effect of cocaine on virologic control, independent of nonadherence to ART."
5697,0.002,2.0,"Dolutegravir, is a second generation integrase inhibitor that had recently received United States Food and Drug Administration and European Commission approval for the treatment of adult patients with HIV-1 infection. Dolutegravir provides distinct advantages compared with first generation integrase inhibitors. Unlike raltegravir, dolutegravir can be given once daily for patients who are antiretroviral treatment naïve. Once-a-day dolutegravir dosing also does not require a pharmacokinetic booster like elvitegravir which minimizes the drug-drug interaction potential of dolutegravir. In Phase III clinical trials, dolutegravir-containing regimens have demonstrated either non-inferiority or superiority to current first line agents such as raltegravir, darunavir/ritonavir, and efavirenz containing regimens. Moreover, dolutegravir may be effective for patients with a history of raltegravir and/or elvitegravir resistance. Dolutegravir will likely play a major role in the management of patients with HIV-1 infection, and will be aided when coformulation with abacavir/lamivudine as a single pill, once-daily regimen is available.

7995,0.002,2.0,"The first use of lentiviral vectors in humans involved transduction of mature T-cells with an human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived env antisense (envAS) vector to protect cells from HIV infection. In that study, only a minority of the patient T-cell population could be gene-modified, raising the question of whether the altered cells could affect replicating HIV populations. We investigated this using humanized NOD/SCID IL-2Rgamma(null) (hNSG) mice reconstituted with approximately 4-11% envAS-modified human T-cells. Mice were challenged with HIV-1(NL4-3), which has an env perfectly complementary to envAS, or with HIV-1(BaL), which has a divergent env. No differences were seen in viral titer between mice that received envAS-modified cells and control mice that did not. Using 454/Roche pyrosequencing, we analyzed the mutational spectrum in HIV populations in serum-from 33 mice we recovered 84,074 total reads comprising 31,290 unique sequence variants. We found enrichment of A-to-G transitions and deletions in envAS-treated mice, paralleling a previous tissue culture study where most target cells contained envAS, even though minority of cells were envAS-modified here. Unexpectedly, this enrichment was only detected after the challenge with HIV-1(BaL), where the viral genome would form an imperfect duplex with envAS, and not HIV-1(NL4-3), where a perfectly matched duplex would form."
216,0.002,2.0,"The adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-based vaccine developed by Merck failed to either prevent HIV-1 infection or suppress viral load in subsequently infected subjects in the STEP human Phase 2b efficacy trial. Analogous vaccines had previously also failed in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) challenge-rhesus macaque model. In contrast, vaccine protection studies that used challenge with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV89.6P) in macaques did not predict the human trial results. Ad5 vector-based vaccines did not protect macaques from infection after SHIV89.6P challenge but did cause a substantial reduction in viral load and a preservation of CD4+ T cell counts after infection, findings that were not reproduced in the human trials. Although the SIV challenge model is incompletely validated, we propose that its expanded use can help facilitate the prioritization of candidate HIV-1 vaccines, ensuring that resources are focused on the most promising candidates. Vaccine designers must now develop T cell vaccine strategies that reduce viral load after heterologous challenge."
8293,0.002,2.0,"A simple delivery route, e.g. oral, would greatly facilitate the acceptance of an AIDS vaccine by a large target population. We developed a vaccine that took advantage of inherent properties of mucosal immunity in response to oral antigen challenge, namely the V-1 Immunitor vaccine (V1), which is a polyvalent oral Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) vaccine. The vaccine, currently manufactured in Thailand, contains pooled, inactivated viral antigens. In order to compare this vaccine with HIV-1 therapeutic vaccines reported earlier we analyzed retrospectively 13 HIV-1-positive patients that had the baseline CD4 T-cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 (range 270-605 cells/mm3). The patients self-administered one 850 mg vaccine tablet at breakfast and dinnertime for an average of 32 weeks (median 26 weeks). The treatment was well tolerated without any toxic effect. Twelve of thirteen patients (92%) and 9 of 13 patients (69%) experienced an elevation in CD4 and CD8 cells. The mean increase in absolute CD4 and CD8 cell counts across this group was 98 (22%; P = 0.02) and 324 (26%; P = 0.05) cells/mm3, respectively. Viral plasma load was measured by PCR in six patients. The observed viremia reduction was within 1 log unit. Subjective parameters, i.e., appetite, energy, and sense of well-being were reported by patients as being markedly improved, reflected in a mean body weight gain of 2.75 kg (P = 0.0008). Oral administration of HIV-1 immunogens provides compelling clinical response, especially when patients are treated earlier."
2638,0.002,2.0,"Due to shared routes of transmission, acute and chronic infection with hepatitis C virus is common among persons living with HIV infection in many regions of the world. In the era of effective antiretroviral therapy, acute HCV infection has been increasingly recognized in HIV-infected persons, particularly men who have sex with men, and liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma, has emerged as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in those with chronic HCV infection, particularly older adults with long-standing coinfection. Over the past decade, the foundation for the management of acute and chronic HCV infection has been interferon alfa. However, due the high burden of treatment-related side effects and low likelihood of sustained virologic response, the impact of treatment with peginterferon/ribavirin on the burden of HCV disease in has been limited. However, the anticipated availability of safe, tolerable and highly efficacious interferon-free, oral HCV direct-acting antiviral combination therapies promise to dramatically change the management of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected persons. Preliminary data from studies of such oral DAA regimens in HIV/HCV coinfected patients suggest that coinfection with HIV will not impair HCV cure with these regimens. Indeed, in the coming era of high effective oral HCV DAA treatments, the only special feature concerning treatment of acute and chronic HCV infection in HIV-infected patients may be drug interactions between the antiretroviral drugs for HIV infection and direct-acting antiviral drugs for HCV infection."

The overall sensitivity and specificity were 34% and 98%, respectively. Using the current CD4 count criteria would globally result in 66% missed opportunity to initiate treatment in a timely fashion. Raising CD4 count thresholds should be considered to increase its sensitivity and reduce missed opportunity."
6621,0.002,2.0,"Adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are nucleotide analogs that inhibit the replication of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lamivudine (3TC)-resistant virus in HBV-infected patients, including those who are coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. The combination of ADV or TDF with other nucleoside analogs is a proposed strategy for managing antiviral drug resistance during the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The antiviral effect of oral ADV or TDF, alone or in combination with 3TC or emtricitabine (FTC), against chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study in the woodchuck, an established and predictive model for antiviral therapy. Once-daily treatment for 48 weeks with ADV plus 3TC or TDF plus FTC significantly reduced serum WHV viremia levels from the pretreatment level by 6.2 log(10) and 6.1 log(10) genome equivalents/ml serum, respectively, followed by TDF plus 3TC (5.6 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV alone (4.8 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), ADV plus FTC (one survivor) (4.4 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), TDF alone (2.9 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), 3TC alone (2.7 log(10) genome equivalents/ml), and FTC alone (2.0 log(10) genome equivalents/ml). Individual woodchucks across all treatment groups also demonstrated pronounced declines in serum WHV surface antigen, characteristically accompanied by declines in hepatic WHV replication and the hepatic expression of WHV antigens. Most woodchucks had prompt recrudescence of WHV replication after drug withdrawal, but individual woodchucks across treatment groups had sustained effects. No signs of toxicity were observed for any of the drugs or drug combinations administered. In conclusion, the oral administration of 3TC, FTC, ADV, and TDF alone and in combination was safe and effective in the woodchuck model of HBV infection."

An 18-year-old Japanese man with HIV and HBV co-infection presented to our hospital. His CD4 count was decreased, and TDF-based HARRT was started. At 30 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAg was not detected. At 36 months after initiation of therapy, HBsAb was detected. We conclude that TDF-based therapy is useful for the management of patients with HBV and HIV co-infection. "

Fifty patients were prospectively evaluated using a novel method of detecting fluconazole resistance with chromogenic media containing fluconazole; results were confirmed with macrobroth testing. Resistant yeasts, defined as MICs > or = 8 micrograms/mL, were detected in 16 (32%) of 50 patients: 7 (14%) had resistant Candida albicans, 7 (14%) had resistant non-C. albicans yeast, and 2 (4%) had mixed resistant yeasts. MICs were > or = 32 in 11 of 16 isolates. Previous fluconazole use and severe immunosuppression were risk factors for resistance. However, 5 of 26 patients had resistant isolates with no prior fluconazole use, and all were severely immunosuppressed. Despite the high prevalence of resistance, 48 patients clinically responded to fluconazole. Fluconazole-resistant C. albicans and non-C. albicans yeast infections are common in patients with advanced immunodeficiency, but clinical efficacy of fluconazole remains high."

All samples were analyzed by envelope heteroduplex mobility assay and found to be subtype B. Twenty-four samples were randomly selected for sequencing of the protease and the reverse transcriptase regions; all isolates were found to be subtype B. Phylogenetic analysis of seven nearly full-length genomes showed that all samples were subtype B. This study shows that the HIV epidemic in Colombia continues to be dominated by the subtype B virus. The predominance of subtype B genotypes of HIV-1 strains in Medellín resembles what is seen in the nearby countries of Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela."
3200,0.002,2.0,"Sera from 79 patients with acute self-limiting hepatitis, 17 patients with acute hepatitis B evolving into chronic HBsAg carriership, and 43 chronic HBsAg carriers without a history of acute hepatitis were analyzed for presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA by a molecular hybridization technique. In acute self-limiting hepatitis, HBV-DNA was cleared within a few weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. The longest period of DNA positivity observed in this group was 42 days. In 29 of 52 patients HBV-DNA was cleared before HBeAg disappeared. Among 17 patients who became chronic HBsAg carriers, HBV-DNA was present for more than 6 months in all but one. Most of the HBsAg carriers eventually cleared HBV-DNA. The DNA clearance frequently preceeded the conversion of HBeAg to anti-HBe. Thus, in many patients there was a transitional period with HBeAg but without HBV-DNA. HBV-DNA was found to be a better index of impending chronicity than HBeAg since persistence of HBeAg for more than 42 days was noted in 10% of the patients who nevertheless cleared HBsAg within 6 months. By that time all those patients had turned negative for HBV-DNA. On the other hand, in 16 of the 17 patients who became chronic carriers of HBsAg, HBV-DNA as well as HBeAg persisted for more than 6 months. The present results also suggest that infectivity in acute hepatitis B is a feature mainly of the presymptomatic and early symptomatic period."

Their outcome in the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era remains unclear. Outcomes in patients who were enrolled in the French Dialysis in HIV/AIDS (DIVA) cohort were determined in a 2-yr prospective follow-up. All HIV-infected patients who were on hemodialysis in France on January 1, 2002, were included and followed prospectively until January 1, 2004. Patients' survival was examined by Kaplan-Meier method, and mortality risk factors were examined using uni- and multicovariate analyses. Survival was compared with that of 584 hemodialysis patients who did not have HIV or diabetes and were enrolled in the French Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study II (DOPPS II) in the same period (after standardization for the average age, gender, and ethnicity of the DIVA cohort). A total of 27,577 patients were receiving hemodialysis in France at the beginning of the study; 164 (0.59%) were infected with HIV, 72% were male, mean age was 44.8 +/- 10.9 yr, and 65% were black. The 2-yr survival rate was 89 +/- 2% and statistically indistinguishable from the survival of the French cohort extracted from the DOPPS II study. Significant mortality risk factors were low CD4 cell count (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4/100 CD4 cells per mm(3) lower), high viral load (HR 2.5/1 Log per ml), absence of HAART (HR 2.7), and a history of opportunistic infection (HR 3.7), the last two being independent (HR 2.6 and 3.6, respectively). Survival of HIV-infected patients who are hemodialysis has greatly improved.

We aim to ascertain the seroprevalence of HSV and its coinfection with HIV and common sexually transmitted infections attending Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient department, RIMS. The study included 92 female patients with RTI. Diagnostic serology was done for HSV-1 and HSV-2 using group specific IgM indirect immunoassay using ELISA, HIV by 3 ELISA/Rapid/Simple (E/R/S) test of different biological antigen. Diagnosis of RTI was made on clinical grounds with appropriate laboratory investigations--microscopy, Gram stain smear etc. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using Nugent's criteria, Syphilis by rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test and Chlamydia trachomatis by IgG ELISA. Out of 92 sera tested for HSV, 18 (19.6%) were IgM HSV positive and 9 (9.8%) were HIV positive. Co-infection rate of HSV in HIV positive was 16.7%. None of the patients had clinical herpes genitalis, all were subclinical cases. 55.5% of HSV positives belongs to age group 21 to 30 years. Of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 IgM positives 3 (15%) had HIV, 4 (22.2%) bacterial vaginosis, 2 (11.1%) were RPR positive, 4 (22.2%) Chlamydia trachomatis, 3 (15%) were pregnant. 16 (88.8%) were unemployed, 14 (77.7%) had education level below 10 standard. Our study suggest that every case of RTI, be it an ulcerative or nonulcerative must be thoroughly evaluated by laboratory testing for primary subclinical genital HSV coinfection as this has profound implications on their judicious management and aversion of complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of HSV infection together with prophylaxis for recurrent HSV disease will prevent progression and spread of HIV disease."
6797,0.002,2.0,"The immune mechanisms associated with the evolution from latent to clinically active mycobacterial coinfection in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans remain poorly understood. Previous work has demonstrated that macaques infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac) can develop persistent Mycobacterium bovis BCG coinfection and a fatal SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease by 4 months after BCG inoculation. In the present study, SIVmac-infected monkeys that developed clinically quiescent mycobacterial infection after BCG inoculation were followed prospectively for the reactivation of the BCG and the development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease. The development of clinically latent BCG coinfection in these SIVmac-infected monkeys was characterized by a change from high to undetectable levels of bacterial organisms, with or without measurable BCG mRNA expression in lymph node cells. The reactivation of clinically latent BCG coinfection and development of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease were then observed in these SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys during a 21-month period of follow-up. The reactivation of SIV-related tuberculosis-like disease in these animals coincided with a severe depletion of CD4 T cells and a loss of BCG-specific T-cell responses. Interestingly, bacterial superantigen challenge of the SIVmac-BCG-coinfected monkeys resulted in an up-regulation of clinically latent BCG coinfection, suggesting that infection with superantigen-producing microbes may increase the susceptibility of individuals to the reactivation of AIDS-related mycobacterial coinfection. Thus, reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in HIV-1-infected individuals may result from a loss of T-cell immunity or from a superimposed further compromise of the immune system."
993,0.002,2.0,"Coinfection with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) is more common than that with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), although more attention has been given to HCV coinfection as a result of its higher frequency of chronic disease. Natural history studies with HIV-HCV coinfection have also shown more rapid progression of liver disease, and end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis C is now a leading cause of death in HIV-infected patients. Like HCV infection, HBV infection can also be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Fortunately, treatment options of hepatitis B are expanding and may have a clinical impact on slowing disease progression. A case study of a patient with severe HBV-HIV coinfection is presented to illustrate what is known about this increasingly problematic disease state."

2289,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat protein is an important pathogenic factor in HIV-associated neuropathogenesis. Despite recent progress, the molecular mechanisms underlying Tat neurotoxicity are still not completely understood. However, few therapeutics have been developed to specifically target HIV infection in the brain. Recent development of an inducible brain-specific Tat transgenic mouse model has made it possible to define the mechanisms of Tat neurotoxicity and evaluate anti-neuroAIDS therapeutic candidates in the context of a whole organism. Herein, we demonstrate that administration of EGb 761, a standardized formulation of Ginkgo biloba extract, markedly protected Tat transgenic mice from Tat-induced developmental retardation, inflammation, death, astrocytosis, and neuron loss. EGb 761 directly down-regulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression at both protein and mRNA levels. This down-regulation was, at least in part, attributable to direct effects of EGb 761 on the interactions of the AP1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors with the GFAP promoter. Most strikingly, Tat-induced neuropathological phenotypes including macrophage/microglia activation, central nervous system infiltration of T lymphocytes, and oxidative stress were significantly alleviated in GFAP-null/Tat transgenic mice. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence to support the potential for clinical use of EGb 761 to treat HIV-associated neurological diseases. Moreover, these findings suggest for the first time that GFAP activation is directly involved in Tat neurotoxicity, supporting the notion that astrocyte activation or astrocytosis may directly contribute to HIV-associated neurological disorders."

Areas covered: An overview of intestinal microflora composition, host reaction during CHC, and a description of relevant clinical trials on the use of probiotics in this field. Expert commentary: HCV patients gut microbiota composition is stable over liver disease stages. This is a unique example of gut disbiosis stability vs. NAFLD, HBV, HIV, and HCV co-infected patients. The impact of HCV infection on intestinal permeability allows gut disbiosis starting, maintenance and its proinflammatory effect until liver cirrhosis and HCC development.

1521,0.002,2.0,"If human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccines are to be highly effective, it is essential to understand the virologic factors that contribute to HIV-1 transmission. It is likely that transmission is determined, in part, by the genotype or phenotype (or both) of infectious virus present in the index case, which in turn will influence the quantity of virus that may be exchanged during sexual contact. Transmission may also depend on the fitness of the virus for replication in the exposed individual, which may be influenced by whether a virus encounters a target cell that is susceptible to infection by that specific variant. Of interest, our data suggest that the complexity of the virus that is transmitted may be different in female and male sexual exposures."
8321,0.002,2.0,"Previous research has been inconsistent in documenting a strong relationship between depression and HIV/AIDS, although a recent meta-analysis of studies examining this issue indicates that rates of depression are modestly higher for this population. For the current study, conducted from 2001-2004, we sought to examine rates and types of depressive symptoms in a cohort of patients receiving HIV care at two urban medical centers. These patients were participants in an intervention study examining adherence and mental health in persons triply diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and HIV/AIDS. Nearly three quarters of these participants were people of color, two thirds described their sexual orientation as heterosexual, and the vast majority were unemployed. We sought to examine the relationship of depression to patients' adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]). Results obtained from structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires indicated that study participants experienced high rates of depressive symptoms, and that 72.9% of participants met criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of this study offer a detailed view of the incidence and nature of MDDs and depressive symptoms for an urban sample of substance-abusing adults with HIV/AIDS. Given the degree to which depressive symptoms and MDD appear to be prevalent for this group, as well as the observation that these symptoms are amenable to treatment, future research should focus on identifying helpful strategies and interventions for treating these symptoms, effective ways of providing linkages to care, and ways in which standardized assessment and treatment protocols might be adapted to better suit this population."
5185,0.002,2.0,"In Taiwan the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier rate is 15% to 20%. Mother infant transmission plays the most important role in the endemy resulting in 20% of the children being HBsAg carrier at 4 years of age. A large proportion of HBV carriers will develop a chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis and ultimately to primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers (7% of neonates) have an estimated risk of 90% to become HBsAg chronic carriers. A plan for control of Hepatitis B in Taiwan will aim to solve the problem of these children, as a priority. A Hepatitis B vaccine trial has been undertaken in Taiwan since October 1981 in a selected population of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of Hepatitis B vaccine alone or in combination with Hepatitis B immunoglobulin in preventing maternal infant transmission of HBV infection. A three way prophylactic regimen comparison was carried out. Subjects consisted of children born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers. Only mature and apparently healthy neonates were included with the parents' formal consent based on real knowledge and understanding. Babies were randomly included in four different groups of study."
3246,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and its antibody (anti-HBs) were studied in 93% of the population of the New Zealand township of Kawerau. Sera were collected from 7901 subjects over six months old, and 3318 (42%) had markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Five hundred and nineteen (6.6%) were positive for HBsAg and 485 (96.4%) of 503 retested were confirmed as chronic carriers. HBsAg prevalence was 5.4% in the 0-4 years age group but only 1 of 66 children under one year old was positive suggesting that later cross infection, rather than perinatal transmission was the major factor responsible for the high pre-school carrier rate. Total HBV marker prevalence increased dramatically in early school years and peak marker prevalence was 67.7% in the 15-19 year age group. Prevalence of HBsAg was more than four times higher in non-europeans than in Europeans (Caucasians). Other factors significantly associated with hepatitis B virus marker prevalence in children were: number of years spent in Kawerau, which was associated with anti-HBs prevalence; and size of household, which was associated with HBsAg prevalence. Number of siblings was not a significant risk factor over and above the effect of size of household. Factors associated with marker prevalence in adults were: number of years spent in Kawerau, which was associated with anti-HBs; birth in the Northern half of the North Island, which was associated with both HBsAg and anti-HBs; size of household, which was more strongly associated with HBsAg prevalence; and amateur tattoos, which were associated with anti-HBs prevalence but not with HBsAg prevalence."
1538,0.002,2.0,"Using the highly sensitive Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA has already been detected in many patients negative for all other serological HBV markers [12]. But yet, the relevance of these findings as a marker of infectivity has not been determined. We therefore have used the PCR to examine the perinatal route of HBV transmission by testing sera from 109 mother-child pairs in Yaoundé, Cameroon. HBV-DNA was detected in 25 (23%) of the mother's sera from which only 5 were positive for HBsAg. At the age of 6 months only one baby out of 25 who could be retested had become positive for HBV-DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg. Low serum HBV-DNA levels which are still detectable by the PCR therefore seem not to be associated with a high risk of perinatal HBV transmission."
6334,0.002,2.0,"A prospective observational study was conducted over a 10-month period to determine the clinical and laboratory manifestations of cryptococcal meningitis in Zimbabwe, a country where antifungal agents are not widely available. Eighty-nine patients with cryptococcal meningitis (median age, 34 years; range, 11-63 years; 56 males) were identified from 406 patients for whom a clinical diagnosis of meningitis had been made. All patients tested were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Cryptococcal meningitis was the first AIDS-defining illness in 88% of patients. Typical presentations were headache, mental impairment, and meningism (median duration, 14 days; range, 1-180 days). The median CD4+ cell count was 70/microL (range, 0-651/microL). The cumulative median survival from the time of diagnosis was 14 days (range, 0-233 days); 22% of patients survived for >30 days. Independent indicators of a good prognosis were not identified. This study provides a unique basis for the development of novel management strategies for patients with cryptococcal meningitis who reside in resource-poor countries."
6889,0.002,2.0,"A cross-sectional serosurvey for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was conducted during the first quarter of 1991 among high risk groups in Djibouti, East Africa, and compared with previous surveys in 1987, 1988, and 1990. The survey demonstrated evidence of HIV-1 infection in 36.0% (n = 292) of street prostitutes, 15.3% (n = 360) of prostitutes working as bar hostesses, and 10.4% (n = 193) of males diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. By multivariate modeling, HIV-1 seropositivity in prostitutes was associated with Ethiopian nationality, working as a street prostitute, and residing in Djibouti for two years or less. We suggest that prostitution, particularly street prostitution, is a major route of HIV-1 transmission in Djibouti."
9314,0.002,2.0,"Trans-dominant negative mutants of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev inhibit the function of wild-type Rev in a dose-dependent manner. This was previously shown to be caused by nuclear retention of the wild-type protein. In the present work, further analysis of the trans-dominant negative effect was performed using cotransfection experiments with different constructs encoding HIV-1 Rev and viral structural proteins together with a plasmid encoding a trans-dominant negative Rev mutant. Thus, one species of pre-mRNA was transcribed from the reporter plasmids. This pre-mRNA was then either spliced or exported by Rev as unspliced RNA for translation of the HIV structural proteins. An immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis were used for analysis of protein expression. In situ hybridization was applied for labelling of unspliced mRNA in transfected cells, and RNase protection analysis was used to determine the relative amount of unspliced versus spliced mRNAs. The experiments confirmed that the transdominant negative mutant inhibited nuclear export of unspliced mRNA. It was, in addition, demonstrated for the first time that the trans-dominant negative mutant also affected a Rev-dependent regulatory step connected with viral pre-mRNA splicing. As a consequence, proteins expressed from unspliced and singly spliced HIV mRNAs decreased while there was an increase in protein products encoded by spliced and alternatively spliced mRNAs."
7143,0.002,2.0,"A new class of membrane-active ether lipid (EL) analogs of platelet-activating factor were studied for in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity. Human T-cell (CEM-ss) monolayers or suspension cultures were used to determine effects of structural modifications of Type A phosphorus-containing and Type B nonphosphorus EL analogs on (a) the inhibitory concentration50 (IC50) for HIV-1 syncytial plaque formation and cell growth, and, (b) virus budding at the cell plasma membrane. Results indicate that representative Type A and Type B EL inhibit HIV-1 but not herpes simplex virus type 2 plaque formation when added before or up to 2 days after viral infection. Anti-HIV-1 activity does not involve direct inactivation of virus infectivity. Type A EL (IC50 range = 0.2-1.4 microM) with alkyoxy, alkylthio, or alkyamido substitution at glycerol position 1 and ethoxy or methoxy substitution at position 2, and Type B compounds (IC50 range = 0.33-0.63 microM) with an inverse choline or nitrogen heterocyclic substitution at position 3 have selective activity against HIV-1-infected T-cells. EL treatment of HIV-1-infected cells is associated with subsequent release of reverse transcriptase activity, but infectious virus production is inhibited with time after infection. Electron microscopic examination of HIV-1-infected and EL-treated cells revealed absence of detectable budding virus at the plasma membrane but presence of intracytoplasmic vacuolar virus particles. In summary, these data suggest that EL analogs are a novel class of agents that induce defective intracytoplasmic vacuolar HIV-1 formation in T-cells. Being membrane interactive, EL are ideally suited for combination chemotherapy with DNA-interactive anti-HIV nucleoside analogs."
7802,0.002,2.0,"Parvovirus B19 has been proposed as the etiological agent of fulminant hepatitis (FH) or hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAA). We studied the prevalence of parvovirus B19 in liver-tissue samples from patients with FH and HAA and from control subjects. In the first study, parvovirus B19 DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 4 of 15 livers from patients with FH and in 3 of 22 livers from patients with nonviral hepatic disease. In a second confirmatory study, livers were tested for parvovirus B19 and its variant erythroviruses, V9 and A6. Tissues were also tested by reverse-transcriptase PCR for the presence of parvovirus B19 transcripts as a marker of viral replication. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of parvovirus B19 DNA in livers from patients with FH or HAA, compared with liver-tissue samples from patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; parvovirus B19 transcripts were not detected. There was a significant increase (P<.1) in the prevalence of variant erythrovirus sequences in livers of patients with HBV or HCV hepatitis, the reason for which is currently unknown."
1748,0.002,2.0,"A peptide designated DP-107 was synthesized containing amino acid residues 558-595 of the envelope glycoprotein gp160 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain LAI (HIV-1LAI). Algorithms for secondary structure have predicted that this region of the envelope transmembrane protein should form an extended alpha-helix. Consistent with this prediction, analysis by circular dichroism (CD) indicated that, under physiological conditions, DP-107 is approximately 85% helical. The high degree of stable secondary structure in a synthetic peptide of this size suggests self-association typical of a coiled coil or leucine zipper. In biological assays, the peptide efficiently blocked virus-mediated cell-cell fusion processes as well as infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by both prototypic and primary isolates of HIV-1. A single amino acid substitution in the peptide greatly destabilized its solution structure as measured by CD and abrogated its antiviral activity. An analogue containing a terminal cysteine was oxidized to form a dimer, and this modification lowered the dose required for antiviral effect from 5 to about 1 microgram/ml. These results suggest that both oligomerization and ordered structure are necessary for biological activity. They provide insights also into the role of this region in HIV infection and the potential for development of a new class of antiviral agents."
3733,0.002,2.0,"Despite China's free antiretroviral therapy (ART) program, there are high rates of treatment failure, large sociodemographic disparities in care outcomes and emerging medication resistance. Understanding patient medication adherence behaviors and challenges could inform adherence interventions to maximize the individual and prevention benefits of ART. This study assessed recent nonadherence and treatment interruption among 813 HIV-infected adult outpatients in Guangzhou, China. Participants completed a behavioral survey, underwent chart review, and were tested for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Factors associated with suboptimal adherence were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among 721 HIV-infected adults receiving ART, 18.9% reported recent nonadherence (any missed ART in the past four weeks) and 6.8% reported treatment interruption (four or more weeks of missed ART in the past year). Lower education, living alone, alcohol use, and being on ART one to three years were associated with recent nonadherence. Male gender, lower education, and being on ART one to three years were associated with treatment interruption. ART medication adherence interventions are needed in China that include individualized, long-term adherence plans sensitive to patients' educational and economic situations. These interventions should also consider possible gender disparities in treatment outcomes and address the use of alcohol during ART. Successful ART medication adherence interventions in China can inform other international settings that face similar adherence challenges and disparities."
2911,0.002,2.0,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the elevation of liver enzyme and/or bilirubin levels caused by the use of a medication or drug. In patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some of these events may not be directly caused by medication. Acute viral hepatitis, reactivation of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and/or alcohol use may play roles. Elevated transaminase levels are a signal of liver injury, but most cases improve despite continuation of drug therapy. Approximately 33% of patients with HIV infection are coinfected with HCV. Patients with HIV or HCV infection are more prone to DILI, possibly because of impaired hepatocyte defense mechanisms. HCV coinfection is associated with a 2-10-fold chance of developing elevated transaminase levels during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should not be denied HAART. Instead, they should be followed-up with monthly liver function tests and referred to specialists if grade 3 or 4 liver enzyme elevations occur."
5675,0.002,2.0,"Arginase I (Arg I) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are important in regulating immune functions through their metabolites. Previous studies have revealed that the expression of Arg I is increased and the expression of iNOS is reduced in the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‑infected patients. As one of the most important immune organs and HIV replication sites, whether similar changes are present in the lymph nodes following HIV infection remains to be elucidated. To investigate this, the present study collected lymph node and blood specimens from 52 HIV‑infected patients to measure the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS by immunohistochemistry and fluoresence‑based flow cytometry. Compared with control subjects without HIV infection, the patients with HIV had significantly higher expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and higher frequencies of Arg I+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the blood and lymph nodes, and these results were contrary the those of iNOS in the corresponding compartments. The expression levels of Arg I in the lymph nodes and blood were negatively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and positively associated with viral load. However, the expression levels of iNOS in the lymph nodes and blood were positively associated with peripheral CD4+ T cell count and negatively associated with viral load. These results showed that alterations in the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in the peripheral T cells and peripheral nodes of HIV infected patients are associated with disease progression in these patients. These results indicate a potential to therapeutic strategy for delaying disease progression through regulating and manipulating the expression levels of Arg I and iNOS in patients infected with HIV."
4550,0.002,2.0,"HIV-1-associated dementia (HIV-D) remains a significant consequence of HIV-1 infection and AIDS. Since the clinical introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of HIV-D has decreased, yet the prevalence has increased as patients are living longer under treatment. Additionally, a less severe form of HIV-D, minor cognitive motor disorder, has become an increasing issue. Two different models have been proposed for virus entry in the central nervous system (CNS) in HIV-D. In the 'Trojan horse' model, the virus enters the CNS early carried by macrophages and infects resident glia; later in the course of infection, virus replication is activated and additional monocyte/macrophages are recruited into the CNS via cytokine/chemokine networks and endothelial-cell-leukocyte interactions at the blood-brain barrier. In the 'late invasion' model, an inherently invasive activated monocyte subset is expanded from bone marrow as a result of immune dysregulation in the periphery in the setting of AIDS. In this review we discuss these two separate, although not mutually exclusive, means for virus entry and persistence in the CNS. Additionally, we explore mechanisms for neuronal injury and apoptosis, including the role of virus, viral and host proteins, oxidative stress and products of infected or uninfected activated microglia and astrocytes. Potential therapeutic strategies are also briefly discussed."
9148,0.002,2.0,"This study analyzes the influence of all-trans retinoid acid (tRA) on apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. tRA inhibits the ex vivo apoptosis in T cells; a more potent effect was observed on activation-induced apoptosis. Phenotypic characterization of T cell subsets prevented from anti-CD3-induced apoptosis by tRA revealed a more potent effect on CD4 T cells. A central regulatory system for apoptosis is the CD95 system, and inappropriate induction of this pathway is thought to contribute to AIDS pathogenesis. In investigation of CD95-based apoptosis, tRA had no effect on activation-dependent induction of CD95 on T lymphocytes, but it inhibited the induction of CD95 ligand expression on anti-CD3-activated T cells. The previously reported in vivo effect of tRA inhibiting HIV-associated apoptosis and the present observations suggest that tRA could be considered to down-regulate apoptosis associated with AIDS pathogenesis."
5076,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic viruses types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) in Mozambique is not known. The present study examined blood samples from 208, 226, and 318 individuals from Northern, Central, and Southern Mozambique, respectively, of all socioeconomic and demographic strata attending public health centers in Mozambique for HTLV-1/2-specific antibodies. Serum samples were assessed for HIV- and HTLV-1/2-specific antibodies by using enzyme immunoassays, and infections with HTLV-1 and -2 were confirmed by using Western blot. An overall HTLV-1/2 prevalence of 2.3% (2.9% in female and 1.1% in male subjects) was observed, and the prevalence of infection increased with age. Regional variation in the prevalence of HIV and HTLV-1/2 was observed; 32.2%, 65.5%, and 44% of individuals tested HIV positive in Northern, Central, and Southern Mozambique, respectively, and 2.4%, 3.9%, and 0.9% tested HTLV-1/2 positive in the same regions. HTLV-1 infection was confirmed in these individuals. No association between HTLV-1 infection and sociodemographic variables or HIV status was detected, although the low number of HTLV-1-positive cases did not allow robust statistical analyses. The results obtained suggest different risk factors and epidemiologic correlates of HIV and HTLV-1 transmission in Mozambique. Furthermore, our results suggested that North and Central Mozambique should be considered endemic regions for HTLV-1 infection. As no cases of HTLV-2 were detected, HTLV-2 appears to have not been introduced into Mozambique."

3871,0.002,2.0,"As part of a continuous search for surrogate markers of therapeutic efficacy in AIDS, spontaneous in vitro production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was investigated in 50 HIV-1-infected adults. It was independent of CD4+ cell counts, p24 antigenemia, serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration, and clinical status of the patients. The effect of zidovudine on this antibody secretion and the appearance of signs or symptoms of HIV-1 disease progression were evaluated in 20 patients over 24 weeks. Anti-HIV-1 antibody secretion decreased significantly (P = .002) as of the first month of zidovudine treatment only in the 13 HIV-1-infected patients without disease progression. This is earlier than the occurrence of variations in CD4+ cell count and serum beta 2-microglobulin concentration. These results suggest that in vitro antibody production could be a surrogate marker for evaluation of the in vivo antiretroviral efficacy of zidovudine, even in p24 antigen-negative patients."
9959,0.002,2.0,"Two components of human serum enhance human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and mask HIV-1 neutralising antibody activity. The first is heat-stable, unique to HIV-1 seropositive sera, and is removed by protein-A chromatography. The second is heat-labile and ubiquitous; it is found in normal serum and is removed by heating at 60 degrees C for 1 h or by treatment with cobra venom anticomplementary protein. Additionally, complement component C3 deficient serum lacks the labile activity although Clq deficient serum contains the labile factor. The data suggest that the two components are antibody and the alternative pathway of complement fixation. The mechanism of action does not involve an increase in either complement-mediated cytolysis or syncytium formation. The activity has been identified in 11 of 16 patients tested to date."
5518,0.002,2.0,"The majority of untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected individuals ultimately develop uncontrolled viremia and progressive disease. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are known to play an important role in controlling HIV-1 replication, which has led to an increasing interest in augmenting conventional antiretroviral therapy with therapeutic vaccination. The successful development of a therapeutic vaccine will rely on the ability to correlate an aspect of the immune response with clinical outcome. In this study, the CD8(+) T cell maturation status of antigen-specific cells in models of well and poorly controlled virus infections were compared, to show that a memory phenotype predominates when antigen loads are absent or low. In HIV-1 infection, the emergence of memory CD8(+) T cells was found to occur only in individuals with highly suppressed viral replication for an extended duration. Such assessments of the immune response may provide a refined measure of virus control."
8228,0.002,2.0,"The antiviral activity of a CD8(+) cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone (TCC108) directed against a newly identified HLA-B14-restricted epitope, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev(67-75) SAEPVPLQL, was analyzed with respect to its kinetics of target cell lysis and inhibition of HIV-1 production. Addition of TCC108 cells or CD8(+) reverse transcriptase-specific CTLs to HLA-matched CD4(+) T cells at different times after infection with HIV-1 IIIB showed that infected cells became susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis before peak virus production but after the onset of progeny virus release. When either of these CTLs were added to part of the infected cells immediately after infection, p55 expression and virus production were significantly suppressed. These data support a model in which CTLs, apart from exerting cytolytic activity which may prevent continued virus release, can interfere with viral protein expression during the eclipse phase via noncytolytic mechanisms. TCC108-mediated inhibition of virus replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells caused rapid selection of a virus with a mutation (69E-->K) in the Rev(67-75) CTL epitope which abolished recognition by TCC108 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that both cytolytic and noncytolytic antiviral mechanisms of CTLs can be specifically targeted to HIV-1-infected cells."
8737,0.002,2.0,"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats enter a clinically asymptomatic phase during chronic infection. Despite the lack of overt clinical disease, the asymptomatic phase is characterized by persistent immunologic impairment. In the peripheral blood obtained from cats experimentally infected with FIV-C for approximately 5 years, we identified a persistent inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. We cloned and sequenced the FIV-C long terminal repeat containing the viral promoter from cells infected with the inoculating virus and from in vivo-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD4 T cells isolated at multiple time points throughout the asymptomatic phase. Relative to the inoculating virus, viral sequences amplified from cells isolated from all of the infected animals demonstrated multiple single nucleotide mutations and a short deletion within the viral U3, R and U5 regions. A transcriptionally inactivating proviral mutation in the U3 promoter AP-1 site was identified at multiple time points from all of the infected animals but not within cell-associated viral RNA. In contrast, no mutations were identified within the sequence of the viral dUTPase gene amplified from PBMC isolated at approximately 5 years post-infection relative to the inoculating sequence. The possible implications of these mutations to viral pathogenesis are discussed. "

A reduction in the susceptibility to indinavir of 6-fold and a reduction in the susceptibility to saquinavir of 24-fold were recognized after long exposure to these drugs with respect to baseline. The emergence of PI resistance corresponded to the selection of amino acid changes L10V, G48M, F53L, I54V, and L90M at the protease. The results were concordant with those obtained by a drug susceptibility assay with primary HIV isolates."
2075,0.002,2.0,"A new DNA virus, designated ""human B lymphotropic virus"" or ""human herpesvirus 6"" (HBLV), has been isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders, in some instances also associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. HBLV, propagated in vitro in human cord blood lymphocytes, was found to be ultrastructurally similar to members of the herpesvirus family. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid made up of 162 capsomeres. Unenveloped nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm wee always coated with a tegument, a feature also described for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). However, the nucleoprotein core of HBLV does not have the beaded appearance as that of HCMV, nor do HBLV-infected cells contain the skein-like structure. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of specific antibodies to viral envelope and internal antigens in sera of infected patients, indicating that this virus is a possible human pathogen. These and previously reported characteristics are consistent with the HBLV being a new and unique DNA virus morphologically belonging to the herpesvirus family."

Herein, we describe the case of a pregnant 30-year-old HIV-infected Ethiopian woman with a CD4 count of 254 cells/microL and an HIV viral load of 1200 copies/mL who presented to medical attention with progressive neck adenopathy. Subsequent histopathology and radiographic findings revealed clinical stage IIIA Classical HL. After a spontaneous miscarriage of 10 weeks into her pregnancy, the patient began highly active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy. Thirty months later, she remained in complete remission. Through a literature review, we identified 2 additional case reports involving HIV, HL and pregnancy. One patient received 3 cycles of chemotherapy, refused further treatment, delivered an HIV-seropositive girl, and died shortly after from complications of presumed pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The second patient received both active antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy, delivered an HIV-seronegative boy, and remained in complete remission at 9 months follow-up. We conclude by offering recommendations for the staging and treatment of pregnant, HIV-infected patients with HL."
3089,0.002,2.0,"B cell subpopulations, as defined by double-labelling techniques with CD5 and CD19 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), were serially studied in 335 HIV-1 seropositive patients. At the time of the first consultation, no important modifications in either CD5+ or CD5- subpopulations were observed, whatever the stage of the disease. However, in 18 out of the 335 patients (5.37%), a sharp increase in B cells exceeding 20% and 300/mm3 was observed. This increase in B cells was mainly accounted for CD5-CD19+ B cell subpopulations and was associated with: (i) evolution of the disease, since only four patients presented it at their first consultation (one lymphadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) and three AIDS); (ii) advanced stages of disease since, at the time of B cell augmentation, two patients were staged as LAS, four as ARC and 12 as AIDS; (iii) a high incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) since three out of the 18 patients presented a histologically confirmed NHL and three others a clinical pattern compatible with this diagnosis. However, in three patients with B hyperlymphocytosis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement revealed the existence of a polyclonal expansion of B cells. These results justify inclusion of a pan-B cell marker in routine phenotypic studies of HIV-infected individuals, as well as the search for NHL among patients presenting this abnormality."
6542,0.002,2.0,"We analyzed immune responses in chronically HIV-infected individuals who took part in a treatment interruption (TI) trial designed for patients who initiated antiretroviral therapy within 6 months of seroconversion. In the 2 subjects who exhibited the best viral control, we detected CD8(+) T-cell responses against 1-2 Gag epitopes during the early weeks of TI and a subsequent increase in the number of epitopes recognized by the later time points. Each of these subjects developed mutations within the epitopes targeted by the highest magnitude responses. In the subject with the worst viral control, we detected responses against 2 Gag epitopes throughout the entire TI and no Gag mutations. The magnitude of these responses increased dramatically with time, greatly exceeding those detected in the virologic controllers. The highest levels of contemporaneous autologous neutralizing antibody activity were detected in the virologic controllers, and a subsequent escape mutation developed within the envelope gene of one controller that abrogated the response. These data suggest that immune escape mutations are a sign of viral control during TI, and that the absence of immune escape mutations in the presence of high levels of viral replication indicates the lack of an effective host immune response."
4504,0.002,2.0,"HTLV-I and HTLV-II infect T lymphocytes. A high HTLV-I proviral load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has been associated with a higher risk of neurologic disease. For HTLV-II, large numbers of infected lymphocytes might contribute to accelerate the immunodeficiency and increase the risk of neuropathy in HTLV-II/HIV-1 coinfected people. We have examined the impact of antiretroviral drugs on HTLV proviral load, testing longitudinal samples collected from 1 HTLV-I infected patient suffering HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM), and two HTLV-II/ HIV-1 coinfected subjects. The HAM patient showed a reduction greater than 2 log in the peripheral proviral load after being treated with zidovudine and lamivudine. In contrast, potent antiretroviral treatment in HIV-1/HTLV-II coinfected carriers produced an initial increase in the HTLV proviral load, which was followed by a reduction greater than 1 log thereafter. In conclusion, antiretroviral drugs seem to reduce HTLV proviral load, although in HIV-1 coinfected persons a transient increase in HTLV proviral load could reflect the rapid blocking of HIV-1 replication occurring in response to therapy, thus causing an increase in the number of circulating T lymphocytes carrying HTLV proviral DNA."
3467,0.002,2.0,"We followed 54 HIV-1 carriers (44 asymptomatic carriers and 10 AIDS patients) by virus isolation and immunological examination and evaluated their usefulness for prognostication of the onset of symptoms. From 37 carriers (27 asymptomatic carriers and 10 symptomatic), 132 HIV-1 strains were isolated; the virus isolation rate was 60% in the asymptomatic carriers (AC) but 100% in the symptomatic. In the AC, the isolation rate was 54.5% in the group showing stable in the CD4+ level but 95.5% in the group showing a decrease in the CD4+ level. With progression of the disease, the culture time required for virus isolation was shortened, and the percentage of isolates showing infectivity to the T-cell line (MT-4 cells) increased. These findings suggest that the virus in the body is changed with progression of the disease to that showing rapid replication, T-cell tropic, and high pathogenicity. Indeed, progression of the disease was observed in all carriers in whom a highly pathogenic virus was detected; some developed the disease within 1 year, some showed temporary recovery in the CD4+ level after AZT administration followed by progression to ARC, and others showed a rapid decrease in the CD4+ level. In contrast, in carriers with only slightly pathogenic virus, the CD4+ level was maintained for a long period. These results suggest that the detection of a highly pathogenic virus is one of the most reliable marker for the prognostication of the onset of the disease. The detection of HIV-1 antigen in the plasma and a decrease in the gag antibody were also associated with the progression of the disease. However, the reliability of these markers seems to be lower than that of virus isolation."
6077,0.002,2.0,"The number of HIV-1-infected patients harboring multidrug-resistant viruses is increasing. Since new antiretroviral drugs with favorable resistance profiles are limited, innovative strategies are urgently needed. Treatment interruptions can lead to a loss in HIV resistance followed by improved response to reinitiated therapy. The authors report the case of a patient with sustained antiretroviral response for 3.5 years after a 7-month treatment interruption. Concomitant with an increase in replication capacity, multidrug-resistant viruses gradually disappeared during treatment interruption. Resistance to protease inhibitors (PI) was completely lost, and resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors was still present when therapy was reinitiated. PI-resistant variants were not detected at four time points after treatment reinitiation. The alignment of the nucleic acid sequences from all different time points suggested that the viruses obtained after treatment reinitiation evolved from less-resistant variants prior to treatment interruption. This was supported by in vitro propagation of the viral plasma population and an individual clone derived from the time point of treatment interruption. This is consistent with a model favoring reversible binding of HIV-1 to reservoirs, as has recently been proposed for follicular dendritic cells. Understanding of this process could help to exploit the reduced fitness of drug-resistant viruses for treatment interruptions."
2323,0.002,2.0,"A defect in specific T cell immunity has long been assumed to be the central mechanism of persistent Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recent studies on HBV transgenic mice have suggested, however, that functional deficit of dendritic cells (DC) was an underlying cause for the T cell dysfunction. The functions of monocyte-derived DC were determined by studying 75 subjects that included chronic hepatitis B patients with low or high HBV load; antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive individuals who had recovered completely from previous acute HBV infection; healthy donors who had received hepatitis B vaccination and were anti-HBs positive; and immunologically naïve to HBV or the vaccine individual. Impaired interactions between monocyte-derived DC and T cells were shown in chronic HBV infection patients, especially in those with active virus replication. The dysfunctions included: (i) failure of DC to increase human leukocyte antigen (HLA-II), B7 expression and interleukin-12 secretion in responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), (ii) defective induction of T cell proliferative response to HBsAg, (iii) failure to activate T cells to produce cytokines and (iv) deficit in the induction of antigen specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In vitro treatment of DC with tumour necrosis factor-alpha improved HLA-II and B7 expression, as well as Th cell and CTL responses. It is concluded that defective DC-T cell interactions may account for the specific T cell immune defects in chronic HBV infection. Immunotherapy that aims at restoring DC functions could offer a new opportunity for effectively managing persistent HBV infections."

Although previous studies have measured knowledge of hepatitis B transmission and prevention practices in A/PI communities, we present results from the first population-based study of this type, which specifically focuses on A/PIs who are chronically infected with HBV. Through telephone interviews, we assessed the HBV risk factor knowledge and prevention practices of a population-based, random sample of persons with chronic HBV who were reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health between October 2007 and July 2009. Among 829 respondents, 67% were foreign born A/PIs of Chinese ethnicity who did not speak English as their primary language. Among all respondents, 75% were unable to identify how they acquired HBV, and 41% said that they do nothing to prevent transmission of HBV to their close contacts. Knowledge of HBV risk factors and recommended prevention practices was poor among A/PIs who are chronically infected with HBV and who may transmit the infection to others."

Between June 1996 and December 1998, 4,608 pregnant women had a blood sample collected for hemoglobin (Hb) measurement, malaria smear, and testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The mean +/- standard deviation of Hb was 9.58 +/- 1.8 g/dL; 21% had malaria in their blood; and 25% of the women were HIV seropositive. Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was more common among HIV-seropositive women in all gravidities compared with HIV-seronegative women (risk ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-1.92). In a multivariate analysis, for primi- and secundigravidae women, the factors malaria, belonging to the Luo tribe, and HIV seropositivity were significantly associated with any anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL), and HIV seropositivity and documented fever were associated with severe anemia (Hb < 7 g/dL). In women of higher gravidities, HIV seropositivity was the only statistically significant factor associated with any anemia or with severe anemia. Asymptomatic HIV seropositivity is an important risk factor to be considered in the differential diagnosis of maternal anemia, independent of P. falciparum parasitemia."

While cross-sectional studies suggest that cocaine users may be at increased risk for depression, long-term effects of cocaine on depressive symptoms remain unclear. This is a longitudinal study of 341 HIV-infected and uninfected men (135 cocaine users and 206 controls) ages 30-60 enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study during 1996-2009. The median baseline age was 41; 73% were African-American. In mixed-effects models over a median of 4.8 years of observation, cocaine use was associated with higher depressive symptoms independent of age, education level, and smoking (n = 288; p = 0.02); HIV infection modified this association (p = 0.03). Latent class mixed models were used to empirically identify distinct depressive trajectories (n = 160). In adjusted models, cocaine use was associated with threefold increased odds of membership in the class with persistent high depressive symptoms (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-6.69) and eightfold increased odds (95% CI (2.73-25.83) when tested among HIV-infected subjects only. Cocaine use is a risk factor for chronic depressive symptoms, particularly among HIV-infected men, highlighting the importance of integrating mental health and substance use treatments to address barriers to well-being and successful HIV-care."

As of June 2011, 50 countries monitored EWIs, covering 131 686 patients initiating antiretroviral treatment between 2004 and 2009 at 2107 clinics. HIVDR prevention is associated with patient care (appropriate prescribing and patient monitoring), patient behavior (adherence), and clinic/program management efforts to reduce treatment interruptions (follow up, retention on first-line ART, procurement and supply management of antiretroviral drugs). EWIs measure these factors and the results have been used to optimize patient and population treatment outcomes."
4994,0.002,2.0,"In addition to their antibacterial activities, certain antimicrobial peptides inactivate enveloped viruses, including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To determine whether peptide bactericidal activities are predictive of antiviral activity, the anti-HIV properties of recombinant human alpha-defensin 5, mouse alpha-defensins, cryptdins (Crp) 3 and 4, and rhesus macaque myeloid alpha-defensins (RMADs) 3 and 4 were determined in vitro. The peptides, purified to homogeneity, had equivalent bactericidal activities that were similar to those of the native molecules. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed RMAD-4 and Crp3 had characteristic alpha-defensin tridisulfide arrays. Of the peptides analyzed, only RMAD-4 inhibited HIV infectivity at 150 microg/ml, and Crp3 unexpectedly increased HIV replication. Quantitative real-time PCRs for minus-strand strong stop DNA and complete viral cDNA synthesis were used to distinguish between preentry and postentry anti-HIV effects by RMAD-4. Viral exposure to RMAD-4 for 1 h prior to infection reduced HIV minus-strand strong stop DNA and HIV cDNA by 4- to 20-fold during the first round of replication, showing that RMAD-4-exposed virions were not entering cells during the first 24 h. On the other hand, when RMAD-4 was added coincident with HIV inoculation, no anti-HIV activity was detected. Viral exposure to Crp3 resulted in a threefold increase in both HIV minus-strand strong stop DNA and HIV cDNA over the first round of replication. Therefore, two alpha-defensins, RMAD-4 and Crp3, inhibit or augment HIV replication, respectively, by mechanisms that precede reverse transcription."
4221,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) tropism can be assessed using phenotypic assays, but this is quite laborious, expensive, and time-consuming and can be made only in sophisticated laboratories. More accessible albeit reliable tools for testing of HIV-1 tropism are needed in view of the prompt introduction of CCR5 antagonists in clinical practice. Bioinformatics tools based on V3 sequences might help to predict HIV-1 tropism; however, most of these methods have been designed by taking only genetic information derived from HIV-1 subtype B into consideration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of several genotypic tools to predict HIV-1 tropism in non-B subtypes, as data on this issue are scarce. Plasma samples were tested using a new phenotypic tropism assay (Phenoscript-tropism; Eurofins), and results were compared with estimates of coreceptor usage using eight different genotypic predictor softwares (Support Vector Machine [SVM], C4.5, C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, PART, Charge Rule, geno2pheno coreceptor, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix X4R5 [PSSM(X4R5)], and PSSM(sinsi)). A total of 150 samples were tested, with 115 belonging to patients infected with non-B subtypes and 35 drawn from subtype B-infected patients, which were taken as controls. When non-B subtypes were tested, the concordances between the results obtained using the phenotypic assay and distinct genotypic tools were as follows: 78.8% for SVM, 77.5% for C4.5, 82.5% for C4.5 with positions 8 to 12 only, 82.5% for PART, 82.5% for Charge Rule, 82.5% for PSSM(X4R5), 83.8% for PSSM(sinsi), and 71.3% for geno2pheno. When clade B viruses were tested, the best concordances were seen for PSSM(X4R5) (91.4%), PSSM(sinsi) (88.6%), and geno2pheno (88.6%). The sensitivity for detecting X4 variants was lower for non-B than for B viruses, especially in the case of PSSM(sinsi) (38.4% versus 100%, respectively), SVM(wetcat) (46% versus 100%, respectively), and PART (30% versus 90%, respectively). In summary, while inferences of HIV-1 coreceptor usage using genotypic tools seem to be reliable for clade B viruses, their performances are poor for non-B subtypes, in which they particularly fail to detect X4 variants."
832,0.002,2.0,"Although most hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals develop chronic infection, about 25% of them are able to clear the virus spontaneously without any therapeutic intervention. The aim of the present study was to identify genes associated with spontaneous HCV clearance in a population of Iranian patients. We genotyped 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 59 selected--candidate--genes in a cohort of 107 HCV-infected participants who spontaneously cleared the infection and 176 participants whose infection persisted. Three out of the 110 SNPs were found to be associated with HCV outcome (P-values<0.03). rs11506105 in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor gene), and rs11881222 and rs12979860 in IL28B (interferon-λ3 gene). Multivariate logistic regression of the three markers showed that the A/A genotypes in both rs11506105 (EFGR) and rs11881222 (IL28B), and the C/C genotype in rs12979860 (IL28B) are associated with HCV clearance (recessive model: odds ratio (OR)=2.06, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.09-3.88, P=0.025; OR=2.09, 95% CI=1.23-3.60, P=0.007; and OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.15-3.35, P=0.014 for rs11506105, rs12979860 and rs11881222, respectively). In conclusion, EGFR and IL28B SNPs are strong independent predictive markers of spontaneous viral clearance."
61,0.002,2.0,"Most current evidence suggests that the infection of resting CD4(+) T cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is not productive due to partial or complete blocks in the viral life cycle at steps prior to integration of the viral genome into the host cell chromosome. However, stimulation of an infected resting T cell by antigen, cytokines, or microenvironmental factors can overcome these blocks and allow for the production of progeny virions. In this study, we sought to understand the structure and fate of the virus in unstimulated resting CD4(+) T cells. Using a novel linker-mediated PCR assay designed to detect and characterize linear unintegrated forms of the HIV-1 genome, we demonstrate that reverse transcription can proceed to completion following the infection of resting T cells, generating the substrate for the retroviral integration reaction. However, reverse transcription in resting T cells is far slower than in activated T cells, requiring 2 to 3 days to complete. The delay in completing reverse transcription may make the viral DNA genome more susceptible to competing decay processes. To explore the relationship between the formation of the linear viral genome and the stability of the preintegration state, we employed a recombinant HIV-1 virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein to measure the rate at which HIV-1 decays in the preintegration state. Our results demonstrate that the preintegration state is labile and decays rapidly (half-life = 1 day) following the entry of HIV-1 into a resting T cell, with significant decay occurring during the slow process of reverse transcription."

Disease processes vary remarkably within this population and often occur with confusing presentations and unusual pathologies related to the immunocompromised state. With the increased awareness and treatment of HIV infection, it can be anticipated that many patients will require surgery for secondary complications of AIDS, in addition to surgical problems unrelated to HIV infection. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with HIV infection underwent major abdominal surgery between 1986 and 1990 at The Mount Sinai Medical Center. Those patients classified as having AIDS had a longer post procedure hospitalization (19 days vs 9 days; P < 0.05) and a higher mortality rate (33% vs 10%). All of the patients who underwent appendectomy survived with few complications. Excluding appendectomy patients, operative mortality was predicted by low serum albumin (P < 0.001). In addition, preoperative hematocrits were considerably lower in non-survivors. Total serum protein and total WBC counts were not predictors of operative outcome."

5187,0.002,2.0,"During the past decade, AIDS has become a global health problem with 182,000 cases reported from 152 countries. It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
6464,0.002,2.0,We identified an unusual case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in a patient (GM43) who exhibited a persistently low antibody response and undetectable viral load during a 5-year follow-up period. GM43 harbored HIV-1 circulating recombinant form 01_AE with gross deletions in the nef/long terminal repeat (LTR) region. The sizes of the deletions increased progressively from 84 to >400 bp during the 5-year period. GM43 appeared to have acquired defective variants from her husband. The genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region were remarkably similar to those that have been reported in slow progressors (such as the slow progressors in the Sydney Blood Bank Cohort). The present study is the first report of slow disease progression due to gross genetic alterations in the nef/LTR region in a person infected with an HIV-1 non-subtype B strain.
2087,0.002,2.0,"Human interleukin-6 has been shown to promote hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, it is not clear whether this influence is the result of a direct interaction between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the HBV envelope proteins or of a rather indirect mechanism. A direct interaction of IL-6 and the preS region of the large envelope protein (L-protein) of HBV has been reported. In this study we assessed the binding of IL-6 and of the IL-6 receptor subunits to the preS region of the L-protein of HBV. Binding of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits sIL-6R and gp130 to preS was assessed by immunoprecipitation with recombinant preS proteins. In patient sera IL-6 and sIL-6R concentrations were analysed with respect to the course of hepatitis B infection during and after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy. The IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits could not be precipitated with recombinant preS proteins. In sera of patients who responded to IFN-alpha therapy by virus elimination, a significant increase in sIL-6R concentration was measured. No increase in sIL-6R levels was seen in patients who did not respond to IFN-alpha. Hence, IL-6 and IL-6 receptor subunits do not bind to preS directly. A possible role for sIL-6R in the elimination of HBV infection is discussed."

All had been followed prospectively prior to death; 7 were demented and 8 were not demented. HIV was detected in 13 of 15 brains by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in the remaining 2 by presence of viral RNA or viral antigen. Quantitative PCR showed a wide range in amounts of HIV DNA with no significant difference between brains of demented and nondemented patients. These results suggest that qualitative features of the virus, rather than increased virus load per se, may be responsible for the clinical differences between HIV-infected patients with and without dementia."

Specimens for cultures were taken weekly until clinical resolution. Therapy with fluconazole was increased weekly as required to a maximum daily dose of 800 mg until resolution of symptoms and oral lesions. Resistant or dose-dependent susceptible yeasts, defined as a minimum inhibitory concentration of > or = 16 micrograms/mL, were detected in 48 (31%) of 155 episodes. Clinical resolution with fluconazole therapy occurred in 107 (100%) of 107 episodes with susceptible yeasts vs. 44 (92%) of 48 episodes with resistant or dose-dependent susceptible strains (P = .008).

While HIV shares similar routes of transmission, the co-infection HCV-HIV is very frequent and the chronic hepatopathy and complications associated with its clinical course are an important cause of morbi-mortality in this population. The gold standard of the treatment for the HCV, has been the interferon and later the combination therapy of interferon plus ribavirine. Currently, the combination of ribavirine and a new pegilated formulation of the interferon has become the standard in the treatment reaching rates of sustained viral response around 40-80%."
3975,0.002,2.0,"Correct endoproteolytic maturation of gp160 is essential for the infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This processing of human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope protein, gp160, into gp120 and gp41 has been attributed to the activity of the cellular subtilisin-like proprotein convertase furin. The prototypic furin recognition cleavage site is Arg-X-Arg/Lys-Arg. Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg or longer iterations of polyarginine have been shown to be competitive inhibitors of substrate cleavage by furin. Here, we tested polyarginine for inhibition of productive human immunodeficiency virus-1-infection in T-cell lines, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and macrophages. We found that polyarginine inhibited significantly human immunodeficiency virus-1 replication at concentrations that were benign to cell cultures ex vivo and mice in vivo. Using a fluorogenic assay, we demonstrated that polyarginine potently inhibited substrate-specific proteolytic cleavage by furin. Moreover, we verified that authentic processing of human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp160 synthesized in human cells from an infectious human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) molecular clone was effectively blocked by polyarginine. Taken together, our data support that inhibitors of proteolytic processing of gp160 may be useful for combating human immunodeficiency virus-1 and that polyarginine represents a lead example of such inhibitors."
72,0.002,2.0,"Serum levels of interleukin-7 (IL-7), a non-redundant cytokine that plays a crucial role in lymphopoiesis, are known to be elevated in HIV-1-infected subjects. To examine further the association between levels of IL-7, CD4+ cell counts and viraemia, we analysed these parameters in a large cohort of HIV-1 patients along with serum levels of 90K, a marker of disease severity but with no established involvement in lymphopoiesis. While IL-7 levels were only found to correlate with CD4+ cell counts, 90K levels presented strong correlations with both CD4+ cell numbers and with plasma viral loads (VLs). These correlations were maintained in patients naive to treatment with antiretrovirals (n = 38) but were abolished when the analysis was restricted to the group receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART, n = 82). Moreover, although 90K levels were significantly reduced in patients on HAART, IL-7 levels continued to be elevated despite successful treatment. The influence of HAART on the variations in these serum parameters was further assessed in a longitudinal study on 32 subjects. The HAART-induced decrease in VLs and increase in CD4+ counts were found to correlate with a reduced serum level of 90K and IL-7, respectively. Nevertheless, following a median period of 33 months of immunological and virological successful HAART, serum levels of IL-7 continued to be significantly elevated compared with those detected in healthy controls. These findings suggest that immunotherapy with IL-7, aimed to replenish T-cell stock in HAART-treated subjects, may have a limited impact on the process of immune reconstitution."
6725,0.002,2.0,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27-positive subjects are uncommon in their ability to control infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, late viral escape from a narrowly directed immunodominant Gag-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CTL) response has been linked to AIDS progression in these individuals. Identifying the mechanism of the immune-mediated control may provide critical insights into HIV-1 vaccine development. Here, we illustrate that the CTL escape mutation R(264)K in the HLA-B27-restricted KK10 epitope in the capsid resulted in a significant defect in viral replication in vitro. The R(264)K variant was impaired in generating late reverse transcription products, indicating that replication was blocked at a postentry step. Notably, the R(264)K mutation was associated in vivo with the development of a rare secondary mutation, S(173)A, which restored viral replication in vitro. Furthermore, infectivity of the R(264)K variant was rescued by the addition of cyclosporine A or infection of a cyclophilin A-deficient cell line. These data demonstrate a severe functional defect imposed by the R(264)K mutation during an early step in viral replication that is likely due to the inability of this variant to replicate efficiently in the presence of normal levels of cyclophilin A. We conclude that the impact of the R(264)K substitution on capsid structure constrains viral escape and enables long-term maintenance of the dominant CTL response against B27-KK10, providing an explanation for the protective effect of HLA-B27 during HIV infection."

9721,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence, genotypes, coinfection and putative core gene sequence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were investigated in the inshore area of the Yangtze River, where hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is thought to be very common. Most patients with liver diseases were infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the incidence of anti-HCV was very low, being 3.4% in patients with acute hepatitis, and approximately 7% in those with chronic liver diseases. The rate of coinfection with HBV and HCV in patients with HCC was 4.5%, which was similar to that in Shanghai (5.6%), but lower than that in Yangzhou (31.2%), Beijing (26.8%) and Zhejiang (28.6%). Of 124 patients with non-A, non-B (NANB) liver disease, 15 (12.1%) were positive for anti-HCV. HCV genotype analysis in 41 HCV-RNA-positive patients with liver diseases showed that genotype II was dominant (85.4%), followed by genotype III (7.3%) and II+III (7.3%). No genotype I or IV was found. The genome sequences of the HCV putative core gene from two patients with chronic hepatitis were more closely similar to those of previous isolates from Japan and China, than to that of an American isolate. These results suggest that HCV infection is not an important etiological factor for liver diseases, and that the HCV isolates in China are from the same subgroup as those in Japan."
8157,0.002,2.0,"In this study we investigated the distribution of the S6F1 antigen, an epitope of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen, on CD8+ T lymphocytes in a series of 15 HIV-1+ and 20 HIV-1- haemophiliac patients. MoAbs recognizing the S6F1 antigen have been claimed to distinguish between killer effectors (brightly S6F1+ stained) and suppressor cells (dimly S6F1+ stained) within the CD8+ lymphoid population. In addition, we tried to find a correlation between the spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin synthesis from patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes and the pattern of S6F1 expression. Although the total number of double-positive CD8+/S6F1+ cells was similar in both HIV-1+ and HIV-1- haemophiliac patients, a significant increase in the CD8+/S6F1+ population bright versus dim was documented in HIV-1-infected with respect to HIV-1- haemophiliacs (bright/dim ratio 3.97 +/- 0.61 versus 0.75 +/- 0.1, respectively, P < 0.005). This finding was correlated to a significant increase in spontaneous in vitro immunoglobulin production in HIV-1+ subjects compared with control haemophiliacs (P < 0.005). Purified CD8+ lymphocytes from HIV-1+ subjects showed a reduced suppressor activity on mitogen-induced immunoglobulin production. Taken together, these data suggest that HIV-1 infection favours the generation of CD8+/S6F1+ bright cells with putative cytotoxic-associated function, leading to a progressive reduction in the number of CD8+/S6F1+ dim suppressor lymphocytes. This phenomenon may contribute to the polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia present in HIV-1+ haemophiliac patients."

When expressed in vitro, the 81-amino acid vpu protein reacted with about one-third of the serum samples from AIDS patients that were tested, indicating that the vpu open reading frame is expressed in vivo as well. Introduction of a frame-shift mutation into the vpu open reading frame did not significantly interfere with expression of the major viral proteins in a transient expression system. However, a five- to tenfold reduction in progeny virions was observed after the infection of T lymphocytes with the mutant virus. These data suggest that the vpu gene product is required for efficient virus replication and may have a role in assembly or maturation of progeny virions."

In murine 3T3 fibroblasts, the block to HIV-1 entry is relieved by the introduction of human CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4, and proviral expression is increased by the introduction of the Tat cofactor, human cyclin T1; however, because of the assembly block, virus fails to spread. A panel of rodent cell lines expressing human CD4, CCR5, and cyclin T1 was established and studied for the ability to support virus replication. Mus musculus lymphoid cell lines EL4 and L1-2 and Mus dunni fibroblasts supported only low levels of virus assembly and released small amounts of infectious virus. CHO and Rat2 cell lines produced more infectious virus, but this production was still 40-fold lower than production in human cells. Only CHO cells expressing the three human cofactors were partially permissive for HIV-1 replication. To investigate the basis of the block to HIV-1 assembly, mouse-human heterokaryons were tested for ability to assemble and release virus. Fusion of human cells to HIV-1-infected mouse cells expressing CD4, CCR5, and cyclin T1 caused a 12-fold increase in virion release and a 700-fold increase in infectious virus production. Fusion of HIV-1-infected M. dunni tail fibroblasts to uninfected human cells caused a similar increase in virus release. More efficient virus release was not caused by increased proviral transcription or increased synthesis of virion components. Analysis of reciprocal heterokaryons suggested the absence of an inhibitor of virus assembly. Taken together, the results suggested that murine fibroblasts lack a cofactor that is required for efficient virus assembly and release."
5558,0.002,2.0,"In The Netherlands, in May 1999 an enhanced surveillance of hepatitis B was begun to collect detailed information of patients with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The objective was to gain insight in transmission routes and source of infection of new HBV cases. Through public health services, patients were interviewed on risk factors. It appeared that the majority (59%) acquired the infection through sexual contact; 52% of these by homosexual and 48% by heterosexual contact. In 60% of the heterosexual cases, the source of infection was a partner originating from a hepatitis B-endemic region. Sexual transmission is the most common route of transmission of acute hepatitis B in The Netherlands and introduction of infections from abroad plays a key role in the current epidemiology of HBV. As well as prevention programmes targeted at sexual high-risk groups, prevention efforts should focus more on the heterosexual transmission from HBV carriers."

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of diffuse interstitial reticular nodulation, and brain nuclear magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of nodular frontal lesions. Microscopic examination of sputum and other body fluids showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli and culture-only growth Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Serology for respiratory tract pathogens was negative except for Chlamydia. An antibody titer in the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class of 1:64 for Chlamydia pneumoniae and, unexpectedly, an antibody titer of 1:1024 for C. trachomatis were found. The patient was successfully treated with antituberculosis agents, and clarithromycin, for presumptive chlamydial infection."
943,0.002,2.0,Occult (surface antigen-negative/DNA-positive) hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common in areas of the world where HBV is endemic.

Up to 88% of PCP cases in HIV-negative patients are associated with prior steroid treatment. Pulmonary colonization with Pneumocystis in HIV-negative patients is associated with corticosteroid therapy in up to 75% of cases. The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence and risk factors of pulmonary colonization with Pneumocystis jirovecii in patients with AID receiving corticosteroid therapy in comparison with healthy control persons.
6600,0.002,2.0,"The mutations in the CCR5 coding region, such as CCR5Delta32 and CCR5m303, that suppress the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 do not exist in Chinese people. However, 9 Chinese subjects in Taiwan with histories of multiple sexual exposures to HIV remained uninfected, suggesting that certain anti-HIV factors do indeed exist. Experiments were therefore designed to investigate the immune mechanism that protects this cohort against HIV infection. Peripheral blood samples from these 9 subjects and 7 healthy people who had not been exposed to HIV were obtained for the quantitation of the levels for beta-chemokines and interleukin 16 (IL-16) in serum samples or secreted by peripheral blood lymphocytes. Significantly higher serum levels for nearly all 3 beta-chemokines, regulation on activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta (P<.05, P<.05, and P=.05, respectively), but not IL-16, were detected in the 9 HIV-uninfected subjects as compared with control subjects. The result suggests that among the host genes and cellular factors thus far identified, beta-chemokines are the major HIV-suppressive factors that protect Chinese people from infection with HIV."

During 36 months we prospectively followed 357 HIV-1-infected patients on a regular base, and all the dermatologic findings were evaluated statistically. Several skin problems such as seborrheic dermatitis, may occur early in HIV infection. Mollusca contagiosa, oral hairy leukoplakia and Kaposi's sarcoma are often clinical signs of marked disease progression with very low CD4-cell counts."
7909,0.002,2.0,"Parvovirus B19 (B-19) may cause chronic anaemia in immunosuppressed patients, including those infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We studied single serum samples from 261 consecutive HIV-infected patients using an enzyme immunoassay to detect IgG antibodies to B-19. The seroprevalence of B-19-IgG was 62.8%. The differences in seroprevalence across gender, age, educational categories, year of collection of the serum samples, clinical and antiretroviral therapy characteristics, CD4+ count, CD4+ and CD8+ percentage and CD4+/CD8+ ratios were neither substantial nor statistically significant. There was a non-significant, inverse association between B-19 seropositivity and plasma HIV load and haemoglobin level. Our results indicated that 37.1% of patients might be susceptible to B-19 infection and remained at risk for being infected, mainly during epidemic periods. As B-19 infection can be treated with immune globulin preparations, it may be included in the diagnostic approach toward chronic anaemia in HIV-infected patients."
240,0.002,2.0,"The genetic heterogeneity and transcription activity of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR region and tat gene have been examined. Comparison involved the relevant genomic regions of viruses isolated from twenty long-term survivors and from ten typical progressors. No significant differences were observed in mutation frequencies among the two groups, although there was a significant higher proportion of synonymous substitutions in the tat gene of viruses from typical progressors. Four LTR sequences showed an insertion of 20-31 residues at the junction between the LTR Nef-coding and the LTR noncoding region. Neither these insertions nor other genetic changes found in these sequences affected the LTR transcription function, as measured in transient expression assays using transfection of both established cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes with plasmid DNA. The results did not allow the association of structural or functional alterations in LTR or tat with a degree of disease progression. The results reinforce the concepts of complexity of HIV-1 evolution in infected individuals, and the multifactorial nature of progression to AIDS."
7758,0.002,2.0,"We have generated several transgenic mouse strains carrying a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) NEF/3' long terminal repeat (LTR) transgene under control of a T cell-specific promoter-enhancer element, showing a depletion of CD4+ T cells in the thymus and periphery. The immunological functions of the line with the most dramatic changes in lymphocyte populations, B6/338L, were analyzed in greater detail. The presence of the transgene in the heterozygous animal is associated with a dominant severe immunodeficiency. Older animals develop lymph-adenopathy and splenomegaly. CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8- single positive thymocytes already are depleted in these mice at the earliest stages in ontogeny, and peripheral T cells are reduced in frequency and present cell surface marker expression, which is characteristic for memory and activated T cells. The immunological response of B6/338L mice to several viral infections is also greatly impaired. Thus, the HIV-1 NEF/3' LTR as transgene in T cells can cause immunodeficiency and disease with striking similarities to a known retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency called murine AIDS (H. C. Morse III, S. K. Chattopadhyay, M. Makino, T. N. Frederickson, A. W. Hügin, and J. W. Hartley. 1992. AIDS. 6:607)."
2883,0.002,2.0,"Oligonucleotide compounds composed of only deoxyguanosine and deoxythymidine were able to significantly inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1)-induced syncytium formation and virus production (as measured by p24 core antigen expression) in an acute infection assay system. The oligonucleotides did not share any homology with or possess any complementary (antisense) sequence motifs to the HIV-1 genome. The guanosine/thymidine-containing oligonucleotides (GTOs) that showed this anti-HIV activity contained natural phosphodiester (PD) linkages (backbones) between the nucleosides. One of the PD oligonucleotide sequence motifs tested was capable of inhibiting HIV-1-induced syncytium formation and p24 production with a median effective dose in culture (ED50) in the submicromolar range. In addition, oligonucleotides tested were able to significantly suppress HIV-1 p24 levels > or = 7 days after removal of the drug from the infected cell culture medium. The growth inhibition properties (toxicity) of this genre of oligonucleotides was determined to be well above the ED50 values yielding high selective indexes. In vitro results showed that GTOs with PD backbones were potent competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. These same molecules were capable of blocking the interaction between gp120 and CD4. All measured activities of these molecules were increased by factors of 10-500 when the PD backbone was replaced with a PT backbone in a sequence-dependent manner. The enhanced antiviral activity displayed by the sulfur group on the oligonucleotide backbone and the lack of any sequence-specific interactions suggest that a percentage of antiviral activity of oligonucleotide-based therapeutics is due to mechanisms other than those originally postulated for oligonucleotides. The good selective index of GTOs coupled with the prolonged suppression of HIV-1 in culture after removal of oligonucleotides from the infected cell culture make this a class of compounds that warrant investigation as therapeutic agents to be used against HIV-1."
2155,0.002,2.0,"Protease inhibitor (PI)-resistant HIV-1 has hardly ever been detected at failed boosted PI-based first-line antiretroviral regimens in clinical trials. However, this phenomenon has not been investigated in clinical practice. To address this gap, data from patients starting a first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/rtv)-based therapy with available baseline HIV-1 RNA load, a viral genotype and follow-up viral load after 3 and 6 months of treatment were extracted from the Italian Antiretroviral Resistance Cohort Analysis (ARCA) observational database. Based on survival analysis, 39 (7.1%) and 43 (7.8%) of the 548 examined patient cases had an HIV-1 RNA >500 and >50 copies/ml, respectively, after 6 months of treatment. Cox proportional hazard models detected baseline HIV-1 RNA (RH 1.79, 95%CI 1.10-2.92 per 1-log(10) increase, P=0.02) and resistance to the nucleoside backbone (RH 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06 per 10-point increase using the Stanford HIVdb algorithm, P<0.001) as independent predictors of HIV-1 RNA at >500 copies/ml, but not at the >50 copies/ml cutoff criteria. Higher baseline viral load, older patient age, heterosexual route of infection and use of tenofovir/emtricitabine were predictors of failure at month 3 using the 50-copy and/or 500-copy threshold. Resistance to LPV/rtv did not occur or increase in any of the available 36 follow-up HIV-1 genotypes. Resistance to the nucleoside backbone (M184V) developed in four cases. Despite the likely differences in patient population and adherence, both the low rate of virological failure and the lack of development of LPV/rtv resistance documented in clinical trials are thus confirmed in clinical practice."
7869,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in vivo is dependent upon the interaction of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 with CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). To study the determinants of the gp120-coreceptor association, we generated a set of chimeric HIV-1 coreceptors which express all possible combinations of the four extracellular domains of CCR5 and CXCR4. Stable U87 astroglioma cell lines expressing CD4 and individual chimeric coreceptor proteins were tested against a variety of R5, X4, and R5X4 envelope glycoproteins and virus strains for their ability to support HIV-1-mediated cell fusion and infection, respectively. Each of the cell lines promoted fusion with cells expressing an HIV envelope glycoprotein, except for U87.CD4.5455, which presents the first extracellular loop (ECL1) and flanking sequences of CXCR4 in the context of CCR5. However, all of the chimeric coreceptors allowed productive infection by one or more of the viral strains tested. Viral phenotype was a predictive factor for the observed activity of the chimeric molecules; X4 and R5X4 HIV strains utilized a majority of the chimeras, while R5 strains were limited in their ability to infect cells expressing these chimeric molecules. The expression of CCR5 ECL2 within the CXCR4 backbone supported infection by an R5 primary isolate, but no chimeras bearing the N terminus of CCR5 exhibited activity with R5 strains. Remarkably, the introduction of any CXCR4 domain into the CCR5 backbone was sufficient to allow utilization by multiple X4 strains. However, critical determinants within ECL2 and/or ECL3 of CXCR4 were apparent for all X4 viruses upon replacement of these domains in CXCR4 with CCR5 sequences. Unexpectedly, chimeric coreceptor-facilitated entry was blocked in all cases by the presence of the CXCR4-specific inhibitor AMD3100. Our data provide proof that CCR5 contains elements that support usage by X4 viral strains and demonstrate that the gp120 interaction sites of CCR5 and CXCR4 are structurally related."

6388,0.002,2.0,"HIV infections represent a major global health threat, affecting more than 35 million individuals worldwide. High infection rates and problems associated with lifelong antiretroviral treatment emphasize the need for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic immune intervention strategies. It is conceivable that insights for the design of new immunogens capable of eliciting protective immune responses may come from the analysis of HIV-specific antibody responses in infected patients. Using sophisticated technologies, several monoclonal neutralizing antibodies were isolated from HIV-infected individuals. However, the majority of polyclonal antibody responses found in infected patients are nonneutralizing. Comprehensive analyses of the molecular targets of HIV-specific antibody responses identified that during natural infection antibodies are mainly misdirected towards gp120 epitopes outside of the CD4-binding site and against regions and proteins that are not exposed on the surface of the virus. We therefore argue that vaccines aiming to induce protective responses should include engineered immunogens, which are capable of focusing the immune response towards protective epitopes. "
5298,0.002,2.0,"More than 18 million persons in the world are estimated to have been infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). As immunodeficiency progresses, these persons become susceptible to a wide variety of opportunistic infections (OIs) The spectrum of OIs varies among regions of the world. Tuberculosis is the most common serious OI in sub-Saharan Africa and is also more common in Latin America and in Asia than in the United States. Bacterial and parasitic infections are prevalent in Africa; protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, and isosporiasis are also common in Latin America. Fungal infections, including cryptococcosis and Penicillium marneffei infection, appear to be prevalent in Southeast Asia. Despite limited health resources in these regions, some measures that are recommended to prevent OIs in the United States may be useful for prolonging and improving the quality of life of HIV-infected persons. These include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and bacterial infections; isoniazid to prevent tuberculosis; and 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine to prevent disease due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Research is needed to determine the spectrum of OIs and the efficacy of various prevention measures in resource-poor nations, and health officials need to determine a minimum standard of care for HIV-infected persons.

6127,0.002,2.0,"More than 75% of all Dutch haemophiliacs participated in a mail survey that included a section on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Although no cases of haemophilia-related AIDS had been reported in the Netherlands at the time of our survey, the threat of AIDS had caused considerable anxiety among Dutch haemophiliacs. This had led almost a third of the patients to change their therapy schedules. These changes were mostly not beneficial and possibly counterproductive, since they were not likely to reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Measures that were advised to prevent HIV transmission, such as the use of condoms, were seldom carried out, even by the 17% seropositive individuals. We conclude that an increase in the informational efforts towards the patients is called for to avoid ill-advised treatment changes and to enhance preventive behaviour."
1236,0.002,2.0,"The present study investigated the prevalence of HIV-1 multiple infections in a population composed by 47 patients under HAART failure and enrolled at the National DST/AIDS, Program, Ministry of Health, Brazil.Detection of multiple infections was done using a previously published RFLP assay for the HIV-1 protease gene, which is able of distinguishing between infections caused by a single or multiple HIV-1 subtypes. Samples with multiple infections were cloned, and sequence data submitted to phylogenetic analysis. We were able to identify 17 HIV-1 multiple infections out of 47 samples. Multiple infections were mostly composed by a mixture of recombinant viruses (94%), with only one case in which protease gene pure subtypes B and F were recovered. This is the first study that reports the prevalence of multiple infections and intersubtype recombinants in a population undergoing HAART in Brazil. Based on the data there was a steep increase of multiple infections after the introduction of the combined antiretroviral therapy in Brazil. Cases of multiple infections may be associated with HIV-1 genetic diversity through recombination allowing for the generation of viruses showing a combination of resistance mutations. "

A variety of cell types was studied including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a CD4-positive T-cell line, and a CD4-positive human monocyte cell line. The combination of rsT4 and AZT inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and multiplicities of infection in several different HIV-1 replication assays. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique using a computer analysis. In all of the cell types tested, combinations of rsT4 and AZT were synergistic in vitro, without additive cytotoxicity."
1950,0.002,2.0,"The life expectancy of HIV-infected persons has extended significantly since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapies. Although classical opportunistic infections are now rarely seen, the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs as well as liver disease caused by hepatitis viruses represent an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV-positive persons. Since the rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is high among HIV carriers (up to 75% among intravenous drug users), HCV/HIV coinfection is widely prevalent. Predisposing liver damage favors a higher rate of hepatotoxicity of antiretroviral drugs, which can limit the benefit of HIV treatment in some individuals. Overall, severe hepatotoxicity appears in around 10% of subjects who began triple combinations including either protease inhibitors or non-nucleosides. The progression to cirrhosis seems to occur faster in the setting of HIV infection, and conversely recent data demonstrate that HCV infection can accelerate the progression to AIDS in HIV-positive persons. Although clinicians have been reluctant to treat hepatitis C in HIV-infected people, this therapeutic nihilism is unwarranted. The availability of new more successful regimens to treat hepatitis C, in particular using the new pegylated forms of interferon in combination with ribavirin, open new hopes for the care of HIV-HCV-coinfected persons."

CD4 cell counts and other potential prognostic markers for disease progression were also evaluated. In January 1990 an open prospective cohort of police officers in Guinea-Bissau was initiated with yearly serological and clinical follow-up. Follow-up ended in June 1998. Symptoms were classified according to the World Health Organization staging system. The analysis included 148 HIV-2-seropositive subjects and 177 HIV-seronegative controls. 25 of the HIV-2-positive individuals were seroconverters (seroincident cases). The progression rate to stage 3 of HIV-2-positive subjects in stage 1+2 was 8.6/100 person-years (py) (rate ratio 6.2 compared with HIV-negative controls, 95% confidence interval 2.7-14.2, p < 0.001), and the progression rate to stage 4, i.e. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was 2.1/100 py. HIV-2-positive people in stage 3 at inclusion progressed to AIDS at a rate of 16.9/100 py. CD4% < or = 20 was found to be a significant prognostic marker for progression to stage 4, both from stage 1+2 and from stage 3.

287,0.002,2.0,"There is uncertainty as to how the effects of antiretroviral treatments on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels and CD4 cell counts can predict reductions in clinical progression to AIDS or death. A meta-analysis was conducted for 27 pairwise comparisons of antiretroviral treatments in 15 randomized trials of antiretroviral treatments. For each trial, three measures of treatment effect were used: (i) 16 week change from baseline in HIV-1 RNA; (ii) 16 week change from baseline in CD4 cell count; and (iii) rate of clinical progression. Treatments which caused greater increases in CD4 cell count and greater reductions in HIV-1 RNA were more effective at reducing the rate of clinical progression (P < 0.05 for each comparison). However, there was variability in the consistency of this correlation between different trials and treatments. The results support the use of both CD4 count and HIV-1 RNA levels as the primary markers of the efficacy of antiretroviral treatment."
8622,0.002,2.0,"We investigated the specific and cross-reactive CD8 T cell immunity to three natural variants (of different geno/serotype) of the small hepatitis B surface Ag (or S protein). The D(d)-binding variants of the S(201-209) epitope showed different immunogenicity. The loss of the consensus C-terminal (P9) anchor abrogated its immunogenicity. In contrast, a conservative (serine vs asparagine) exchange at P7 primed cross-reactive CD8 T cells that preferentially recognized the priming variant. Cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses to a variant could be primed in mice tolerant to an alternative variant of the D(d)-binding S(201-209) peptide. Loss of the C-terminal (P10) anchor in S(185-194) eliminated its immunogenicity in HLA-A*0201(A2)-transgenic mice but two conservative exchanges (leucine vs valine in P2, and leucine vs isoleucine in P6) in S(208-216) generated cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses with strong preference for the priming variant. Similar cross-reactive recognition of variant envelope epitopes were also found in S(208-216)-specific CD8 T cells from hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. Distinct CD8 T cell populations cross-reactive to natural variants of class I-restricted HBV epitopes can be primed by vaccination (of mice) or natural infection (of humans), and they may play a role in the ""spontaneous remission"" or the specific immunotherapy of chronic HBV infection."
5141,0.002,2.0,"Monitoring hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants periodically during nucleoside analogue treatment is of great clinical significance, particularly in persistently HBV DNA-positive patients. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD (Tyr-Met-Asp-Asp) and YVDD (Tyr-Val-Asp-Asp) populations in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients whilst undergoing lamivudine (LMV) treatment. In this study, we sought to investigate the dynamic changes of HBV YMDD and YVDD variants by ultrasensitive real-time amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (RT-ARMS-qPCR) and evaluate its significance for changes in the treatment of CHB patients. RT-ARMS-qPCR was established and evaluated with standard recombinant plasmids. Fifteen CHB patients receiving LMV (100 mg daily) were consecutively recruited and followed up for 60 weeks. Serum samples were obtained from each patient at baseline and every 12 weeks. The total HBV DNA, HBV YMDD DNA and YVDD DNA levels were measured using RT-ARMS-qPCR at all given time points after treatment. Routine liver biochemistry parameters, including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, were also measured every 12 weeks. The linear range of the assay was between 1×10(12) and 1×10(5) copies ml(-1). The low detection limit was 1×10(4) copies ml(-1). After 60 weeks of LMV treatment, nine patients experienced virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant could be detected 12-48 weeks before virological breakthrough. The YVDD variant was detected as the predominant population (range 69.4-100 %) in patients by the time virological breakthrough appeared. We concluded that RT-ARMS-qPCR was sensitive for the detection and quantification of low levels of HBV mutation. Periodic detection of HBV YM(V)DD every 12 weeks during LMV treatment is helpful for therapeutic decision making. "

The minimum prevalence of HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV were seen in HIV patients' wife (HIV(+) patients who were infected by monogamous sexual contact with their HIV positive husband) both of them were 8% (P<0.0001). This study showed that HBV-HIV and HCV-HIV coinfections are significant in patients with HIV/AIDS in Iran. A greater relevance was observed in the association between HCV and HIV. This study suggests that it is necessary to investigate risk factors and risk groups for these infections in Iran."

Forty-eight patients (47%) had CC genotype, 42 (42%) had CT, and 11 (11%) had TT, with the allelic frequency being 68% for C allele and 32% for T allele. The rate of serum HBsAg clearance was 29% (n=14) in CC compared to 13% (n=7) in non-CC, genotype carriers (P=0.039). Baseline HBV DNA levels<6 log cp/mL (odds ratio [OR], 11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-50.6; P=0.001), ALT levels>136 IU/L (OR, 6.5; 95% CI: 1.8-22.5; P=0.003), duration of IFN (OR, 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02-1.31; P=0.021), and genotype CC (OR, 3.9; 95% CI: 1.1-13.2; P=0.025) independently predicted HBsAg clearance."
4467,0.002,2.0,"To disclose the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the tuberculosis epidemic in Taiwan, we prospectively screened for HIV infection in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. A total of 378 patients who were admitted to the Taiwan Provincial Chronic Disease Control Bureau from January through December 1996 were enrolled. HIV serologic testing was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A positive ELISA test was confirmed by Western blot analysis. One patient was infected with HIV. We conclude that the impact of HIV infection on the epidemic of tuberculosis in Taiwan is not significant at present."
5564,0.002,2.0,"Adolescent Impact, a developmentally targeted behavioral intervention aimed at decreasing risk behaviors and promoting health care adherence, was delivered to 83 HIV-infected youth, aged 13-21 years, receiving care in five urban HIV centers. Participants completed a patient satisfaction survey following the 12 part intervention consisting of seven groups and five individual sessions. A feedback questionnaire was also completed during each group session to gain more insight on participant experiences. Several indicators suggested high levels of satisfaction. First, overall attendance was relatively high. Second, participants rated their subjective experience and group content favorably. No differences in satisfaction ratings emerged between perinatally infected adolescents and those who acquired HIV through risk behaviors. However, differences emerged regarding perceived intervention utility and content-specific preferences. Findings suggest that Adolescent Impact participants were satisfied with the intervention and that a heterogeneous group of HIV-infected youth could be advantageously integrated into the same secondary prevention program."
8773,0.002,2.0,"The DATTA panelists considered aerosolized pentamidine to be both safe and effective for primary and secondary prophylaxis of PCP. T4 helper cell counts offer guidance as to the best candidates for primary prophylaxis. Patients with a T4 helper cell count of fewer than 200/mm3 are the most appropriate group to receive primary prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine. However, T4 helper cell counts are not an exclusive criterion for aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. Some DATTA panelists suggested that certain patients, such as those with Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphomas and those with concomitant human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection, might be considered candidates for aerosolized pentamidine regardless of T4 helper cell counts. There is no current literature to support this, and this opinion is based solely on clinical experience. Perhaps the use of other markers of immune function (beta 2-microglobulin, neopterin) in conjunction with T4 helper cell counts will give a better indication of when to start primary prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine is not the only potential prophylactic regimen for PCP. Other drugs, including pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and dapsone, are currently being evaluated. Prior diagnosis and therapy for patients with M tuberculosis must occur before initiation of the use of aerosolized pentamidine. This and other appropriate environmental precautions should reduce transmission of M tuberculosis to health care workers and other patients. Whether any prophylactic treatment of an opportunistic infection will prolong survival in HIV-infected individuals has yet to be proved. The assumption is made, however, that a reduction in opportunistic infections should lower mortality and improve the quality of life."
4991,0.002,2.0,"The purpose of this article is to describe the psychosocial factors associated with alcohol and/or drug (AOD) use among HIV-infected individuals. Their attitudes toward AOD use are also examined. Three hundred and three HIV-infected adults completed a survey on AOD use while waiting for their appointment at the largest, HIV-outpatient clinic in the Gulf South. Logistic regression showed that associating with others who use drugs and hospitalization for a mental illness were associated with current AOD use. Variables derived from the AIDS Risk Reduction Model that integrates elements of the Health Belief Model, efficacy theory, and social network theory, indicated that 14% of the sample admitted to having an AOD problem. Twenty-six percent of the AOD users reported that they have little social support to help them stop their AOD use. A disturbing finding was that 24% of the AOD users have actively sought help or treatment for their AOD problem and have not been able to find help. These patients differ significantly from the AOD users who could find help in that they are primarily African-American and 46% have been hospitalized for a mental illness. Motivational strategies and mental health interventions are necessary, which provide peer counseling and social support, factors that have been found to greatly influence behavior change. The intervention may also need to include spiritual and humor components because the vast majority of AOD users are interested in treatment approaches that include these two elements."

2715,0.002,2.0,"Ten subjects received 600 to 1,200 mg of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor ritonavir per day. Following 2 weeks of therapy, plasma HIV RNA levels decreased by a mean of 1. 57 (range, 0.89 to 1.96) log units. With continued therapy, HIV RNA levels began to rise in eight subjects. The initial rise in plasma RNA levels was temporally associated with the development and quantitative increase in the V82 resistance mutation. Doubling times of the V82A mutant virus were estimated to be 2.4 to 4.8 days. An L63P/A mutation was commonly present at baseline even in subjects with a durable virologic response. The concomitant acquisition of an L63P/A mutation with the V82A/F mutation at the time when plasma RNA levels rebounded suggests a role for the L63P/A mutation in improving the fitness of the V82A/F mutation. Subsequent additional genotypic changes at codons 54 and 84 were often associated with further increases in plasma RNA levels. Ongoing viral replication in the presence of drugs resulted in the appearance of additional genotypic changes, including the L90M saquinavir resistance mutation, and decreased phenotypic susceptibility. The relative fitness of the protease V82A ritonavir resistance mutation and reverse transcriptase T215Y/F zidovudine resistance mutation following drug withdrawal were estimated to be 96 to 98% that of the wild type. Durability of the virologic response was associated with plasma RNA levels at the nadir. A virologic response beyond 60 days was not observed unless plasma HIV RNA levels were suppressed below 2,000 copies/ml, consistent with estimates from V82A doubling times for selection of a single resistance mutation to dominate the replicating population."
4391,0.002,2.0,"The host factors involved in the restriction of tumor growth were studied in nude mice transplanted with a cloned line of chronically human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected U937 cells. HIV-infected and uninfected U937 cells exhibited the same growth patterns in culture. However, HIV-infected cells were not tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously in nude mice, whereas large solid tumors were observed in mice injected with uninfected U937 cells. Injection of nude mice with antibody to alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) enabled HIV-infected U937 cells to grow progressively in approximately 90 to 100% of mice. HIV-infected U937 cells formed solid tumors in the majority (60 to 90%) of either immunosuppressed (splenectomized, irradiated, and anti-asialo-GM1-treated) or genetically immunodeficient (bg/nu/xid) nude mice. In mice treated with antibodies to IFN-alpha/beta with established HIV-positive tumors, a direct correlation was found between p24 antigenemia and tumor size. Treatment of established HIV-positive U937 cell tumors with human IFN-alpha or mouse IFN-alpha/beta resulted in a clear-cut inhibition of both tumor growth and p24 HIV antigenemia. In contrast, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha markedly inhibited tumor growth but did not significantly decrease serum p24 levels. 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine treatment did not affect either tumor growth or the levels of serum p24 antigen. These data indicate that endogenous IFN-alpha/beta is a crucial factor in the restriction of both tumor growth and p24 antigenemia in mice injected with HIV-infected tumor cells. Moreover, the results suggest that the development of HIV-1 p24 antigenemia in athymic immunosuppressed mice may represent an interesting in vivo model for anti-HIV therapy."
9412,0.002,2.0,"The absence of detectable anti-HBc antibodies in some hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients may be due to altered core-protein (HBc) sequences. To investigate this possibility we sequenced the pre-C/C-region of HBV isolated from 12 juvenile cancer patients who incurred a nosocomial infection of HBV during chemotherapy but did not develop anti-HBc antibodies or acute cytolytic episodes. The sequences demonstrated the highest sequence homology to the pre-C/C region of a previously cloned HBV genome (subtype ayw) and no deletions or striking mutations were detected. Up to 7 years after infection almost all the survivors developed low titers of anti-HBc antibodies but no clinical signs of hepatic damage. These results suggest that chemotherapy may induce a tolerance status to HBcAg, the most immunogenic HBV protein."
5832,0.002,2.0,"In some patients with chronic liver disease induced by hepatitis B virus, viral DNA is known to persist in low concentration in serum after seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antibody-positivity. This phenomenon has, however, not been documented in asymptomatic black African carriers of hepatitis B virus. Using nested amplification by the polymerase chain reaction, we detected low concentrations of hepatitis B virus DNA in the serum of 6 of 23 (26%) healthy black African adults with normal liver function and with hepatitis B virus surface antibody as the only serological marker of the virus. This finding offers one explanation for the earlier observation of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatocellular carcinomas in black Africans whose serum was positive for surface antibody alone. A number of genetic changes were found in the six isolates that might be responsible for evasion of the immune response and persistence of the virus. Isolated mutations were detected in the ""a"" determinant of the surface gene and in the encapsidation signal. In all five isolates sequenced in the core promoter, mutations were present in the upstream regulatory region. Recombination between genotypes A and D was present in three of the isolates, including both of those in which the entire genome was sequenced. This change in genotype also overlapped the amino end of the polymerase domain and may result in sufficiently low levels of replication to allow viral persistence. Topoisomerase 1 specific trinucleotides were concentrated in the vicinity of the recombination breakpoints."
5046,0.002,2.0,"To evaluate the contribution of acquired immune deficiency syndrome-defining conditions (ADCs) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated wasting, we analyzed longitudinal data from 671 participants in a nutrition and HIV cohort study. Data on ADCs, height, and weight were collected at baseline and during 6 monthly study visits. The frequency of ADCs decreased over time, but the relative risk (RR) of wasting (decrease in body mass index [BMI] to <20 kg/m(2)) increased with a history of >1 ADC; the RR of wasting increased 1.3-fold with each additional historical ADC. Any ADC during the 6 months prior to a study visit was associated with a decrease in BMI to <20 kg/m(2). The risk of wasting increased 2.7-fold with each additional recent ADC. These risks were not altered when adjusted for socioeconomic status, CD4 cell count, energy intake, or baseline BMI. Although ADCs contribute to the development of wasting, their contribution is relatively small."
9051,0.002,2.0,"We prospectively studied the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the presentation and outcome of tuberculosis. A total of 216 patients with tuberculosis were identified; 162 (75%) of these patients were tested for antibodies to HIV; 92 (57%) were seropositive. The patients who were seropositive for HIV were more likely to be male and Hispanic and to have been homeless or incarcerated. Eighty-one percent of these patients had CD4 lymphocyte counts of < or =200/mm3. The seropositive patients had extrapulmonary tuberculosis more often than did the seronegative patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-4.8). Smears for acid-fast bacilli were positive more often for non-HIV-infected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (74.5%) than for HIV-infected patients (54.3%) [OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.01-6.02]-even those with focal or cavitary disease. A delay in initiating therapy was associated with in-hospital mortality: the median time from admission to the start of treatment was 4 days for patients who survived and 15 days for those who died (P = .02). The median survival was 22.7 months for HIV-infected patients who did not die during the initial hospitalization. Factors independently associated with reduced rates of survival included the severity of immunodeficiency, nonuse of directly observed therapy, infection due to drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and a history of injection drug use."
6151,0.002,2.0,"Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) are thought to play an important role in prevention and control of HIV-1 infection and should be targeted by an AIDS vaccine. It is critical to understand how HIV-1 induces Nabs by analyzing viral sequences in both tested viruses and sera. Neutralization susceptibility to antibodies in autologous and heterologous plasma was determined for multiple Envs (3-6) from each of 15 subtype-C-infected individuals. Heterologous neutralization was divided into two distinct groups: plasma with strong, cross-reactive neutralization (n=9) and plasma with weak neutralization (n=6). Plasma with cross-reactive heterologous Nabs also more potently neutralized contemporaneous autologous viruses. Analysis of Env sequences in plasma from both groups revealed a three-amino-acid substitution pattern in the V4 region that was associated with greater neutralization potency and breadth. Identification of such potential neutralization signatures may have important implications for the development of HIV-1 vaccines capable of inducing Nabs to subtype C HIV-1."
6452,0.002,2.0,"Pakistan is experiencing a growing HIV epidemic. Antiretroviral drugs (ARV) have been smuggled into the country and available without prescription since the early 1990s, but are now provided free of cost by the government. We assessed the prevalence of HIV-1, drug resistance, and subtype distributions. Blood specimens were collected from HIV-1-infected participants registered in Sindh Province on dry blood spot (DBS) cards in 2008. Pol, protease, and partial reverse transcriptase regions were sequenced after reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). HIV-1 subtype was assigned by phylogenetic analysis. Primary drug resistance was analyzed by the Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool using the Stanford Surveillance Drug Resistance Mutation (SDRM) major mutation list. Out of 100 blood samples collected, 42 were suitable for testing. Out of 42, 11 were ARV-receiving and 31 ARV-naive patients. Among them, 24 were injection drug users (IDUs), four immigrants, two hijras (male transvestites), two men who have sex with men (MSM), four prisoners, one female sex workers, two spouses of HIV-infected persons, and four from the general population. ARV resistance among naive patients was 2/31 (6.5%) and 36.4% (4/11) among ARV-experienced patients making an overall resistance of 14.2%. HIV-1 subtype A1 was the predominant subtype found in 35/42 (83.3%) followed by CRF35_AD and C, 6.5% each. Subtype D and G were found in one (2.4%) each. A significant proportion of Pakistani HIV patients has ARV drug resistance. Physicians treating patients should consider the magnitude of drug resistance while selecting regimens, and address drug adherence aggressively."
2981,0.002,2.0,"In the context of the optimism around antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prevention of HIV/AIDS, addressing the barriers to long-term ART adherence is critical. This is particularly important given the tendency to individualise or use a blame discourse when exploring why HIV-infected patients ""fail"" to adequately adhere to ART, and not sufficiently exploring contextual reasons for poor adherence that may require varying solutions. This study took place at three clinics and one hospital in Khayelitsha, South Africa, to document the contextual factors that challenged ART adherence in this community. Interviews were conducted with 20 HIV-infected patients who had defaulted on their ART and were subsequently admitted to Khayelitsha hospital for clinical complications, and 9 ART service providers including doctors, nurses and HIV counsellors. Interviews assessed the reasons patients defaulted on ART and explored ways this could be prevented. Data from both groups were analysed collectively using thematic analysis. While the interviews revealed a landscape of environmental risks threatening adherence to ART, all patients managed to overcome the identified barriers at some point in their treatment phase, indicating the fluidity of patients' needs and decision making. Patients reported that distrustful relationships with service providers could inhibit their understanding of ART and/or interrupt their follow-up at clinics. Patients described their rationale and agency underlying non-adherence, such as testing their bodies' physical limits without ART medication. The study speaks to the need to appreciate contextual social and structural barriers related to ART adherence, and how these are negotiated differently by specific sub-groups, to support an appropriate response. It is imperative to not solely emphasise loss to follow-up but also assess patients' subjective trajectory of their ART journey, decision making and agency with adhering to ART, their relations with healthcare workers, and how these dynamics are intertwined with broader constraints in health systems."
1757,0.002,2.0,"Cytolytic activity of human mononuclear peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy donors, cultured in interleukin-2 conditioned medium, was abrogated by in vitro infection with the lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) isolate of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Although viral antigens are not expressed in cultured cells until 14 days postinfection, cytolytic activity was lost as early as 3 days after infection. Loss of cytolytic function was not a result of the release of suppressive factors from either infected cells or uninfected CEM cells since supernatants from neither infected cultures nor CEM cell cultures had any inhibitory effects on the function of uninfected cells. Cultured lymphocytes expressing Leu 11b were also shown to express HIV antigens via immunofluorescence after 14 days in culture. These results suggest that natural killer (NK) cells, as defined by expression of Leu 11b, were infected by HIV in vitro and the loss of lytic function was likely a direct consequence of that infection."
5783,0.002,2.0,"We have succeeded in growing the HTLV-IIIB strain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in cultured human thymic epithelial (TE) cells. Expression of the HIV-1 proteins p17 and p24 was detected by immunofluorescence and reached a peak at 3 days after infection. Antigen capture and reverse transcriptase assays were used to detect HIV-1 in culture fluids, with positive results also being realized. The infection was cytolytic; cellular disarrangement, increased numbers of Hassall's corpuscles, and giant cells first appeared in monolayers of TE cells at 2 days after inoculation. By 4 days these changes were increased, and by 7 days, retraction and involution of TE cells were evident. The infection of TE cells by HIV-1 was blocked by preincubation with monoclonal OKT4A antibodies directed against CD4 target molecules."
6283,0.002,2.0,The recombinant envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) of Chinese Yunan epidemic strain was expressed in E. coli for confirming the antigenic domains of the protein. The recombinant prokaryotic expressive plasmid pYNenv was constructed by inserting the env DNA fragment which encode the gp120 of HIV-1 Yunnan strain into pBV220. The env DNA fragment was obtained by nested polymerase chain reaction with the HIV-1 infected patients peripheral blood macrophage and monocyte genomes from Yunan HIV-1 epidemic area as template. The recombinant plasmid pYNenv was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli DH10b by pYNenv after vibration culture at 30 degrees C for 20 hours then at 42 degrees C for 5 hours and confirmed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. The protein can specifically react with the serum of HIV-1 infected patient from Yunan epidemic area by Western blot assay. The result showed that the recombinant protein can be used as antigen for detection of HIV-1 membrane glycoprotein antibody as well as for the further study of the role of envelope protein in pathology.
7313,0.002,2.0,"Shandong province has been providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to eligible HIV/AIDS patients since 2003 using first-line regimens. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess virological response and resistance development from ART patients. Between 2006 and 2008, blood was collected from 143 ART patients. Viral load (VL) was determined with a detection limit of 50 copies/ml; those with detectable VL were genotyped with dried plasma spots using a broadly sensitive genotyping assay. Resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Of the 143 patients, 72% [95% confidence interval (CI): 65.9-78.2] suppressed their VL to <50 copies/ml. Genotyping analysis of the remaining 40 patients revealed that 21 (53%, CI: 37.0-68.0) harbored one or more mutations. The most common mutations were thymidine-analog mutations (22.5%) and M184V (10%) to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and V106I/A /M (17.5%), Y181C (15%), and H221Y (12.5%) to non-NRTIs (NNRTIs); 13 patients had mutations to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. Patients with VL >1000 copies/ml appear to harbor more mutations than those with VL between 50 and 1000 (62.1% vs. 27.3%, p>0.05). Resistance mutations were intensified among 10 patients for whom two sequential specimens were obtained and accumulation of resistance mutations predicted compromised treatment outcomes and future drug selections. This study provides a snapshot of the virological responses and resistance profiles for patients on first-line regimens, indicating that patient monitoring is a critical component in preventing the accumulation of resistance mutations among patients failing their regimens and thus maintaining the effectiveness of the first-line regimens."

SECOND-LINE study participants were assessed at baseline for HIV-1 subtype, demographics, HIV-1 history, ART exposure, viral load (VL), CD4(+) count, and genotypic ART resistance. We used backward stepwise multivariate regression (MVR) to assess associations between baseline variables and presence of ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations, ≥1 NNRTI mutation, ≥3 thymidine analog-N(t)RTI [ta-N(t)RTI] mutations (TAMs), the K65/K70 mutation, and predicted etravirine (ETV)/rilpivirine (RPV) activity. The inclusion p-value for MVR was p < .2. The exclusion p-value from stepwise elimination was p > .05. Of 541 participants, 491 (91%) had successfully characterized baseline viral isolates.

Baseline CD4(+) 200-394 cells/mm(3) were associated with <3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 0.47; 95% CI 0.29-0.77; p = .003), absence of the K65/K70 mutation (OR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.26-0.73; p = .002), and higher ETV sensitivity (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.35-0.78; p = .002). Recent tenofovir (TDF) use was associated with K65/K70 mutations (OR = 8.91; 95% CI 5.00-15.85; p < .001). Subtype CRF01_AE was associated with ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.31-4.17; p = .004) and higher RPV resistance (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.30-3.49; p = .003), and subtype C was associated with <3 TAMs (OR = 0.45; 95% CI 0.21-0.99; p = .015). Subtypes CRF01_AE (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.26-4.78; p = .008) and G (OR = 4.77; 95% CI 1.44-15.76; p = .01) were associated with K65/K70 mutations. Higher VL at confirmed first-line VF was associated with ≥3 N(t)RTI mutations (OR = 1.39; 95% CI 1.07-1.78; p = .013) and ≥3 TAMs (OR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.15-2.29; p = .006). The associations of first-line resistance mutations across the HIV-1 subtypes in this study are consistent with knowledge derived from subtype B, with some exceptions.

7232,0.002,2.0,"To assess the role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the authors compared survival of tuberculosis patients and controls matched on year of HIV diagnosis and CD4+ lymphocyte count. Patients were selected in the Aquitaine Cohort, which follows, since 1985, all patients infected with HIV, aged more than 13 years, in five hospitals. Time of inclusion of controls was the date of diagnosis of tuberculosis for the corresponding tuberculosis patient. Patients who had received primary prophylaxis against mycobacteria other than tuberculosis were excluded. As of June 30, 1994, 104 tuberculosis patients and 620 controls were selected; they were similar, except for history of intravenous drug use (tuberculosis patients, 51%, vs. controls, 31%) and AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (40 vs. 29%). Survival was shorter in tuberculosis patients than in controls (risk ratio 1.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1) even after controlling for differences at entry. The risk of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or a decrease to fewer than 50 CD4+ cells/mm3 was slightly but not statistically greater in tuberculosis patients than in controls. Tuberculosis disease affected survival but not occurrence of subsequent opportunistic infections or rate of CD4+ count decline. Tuberculosis may be a marker of advanced HIV and may accelerate its course of infection."
9943,0.002,2.0,"To assess the hypothesis that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) might mimic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) allodeterminants and interact with T-cell receptors (TCRs) of alloreactive T-cells, we have done a preliminary analysis of the range of alpha beta TCR gene products in 16 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with normal CD4 counts and in 16 healthy HIV-1-negative controls. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies with a two-colour direct immunofluorescence method, we found a significant increase in the expression of the V beta 5.3 subfamily in the HIV-positive patient group compared with controls (p less than 0.01). Selected increase in expression of V beta sequences has been described in various autoimmune conditions and our findings raise the possibility that the immunopathological damage from HIV infection may be due to the induction of autoreactivity. If HIV does mimic MHC II, the normal immune response to the virus could represent an autoimmune process similar to graft-versus-host disease."

Of 926 undocumented migrants and refugees visiting one of the primary-level clinical centres from January 2012 to June 2013, 882 (95%) were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), total hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and antibodies against HCV and HIV. Of the 882 individuals enrolled, 78 (9%) were HBsAg positive, 35 (4%) anti-HCV positive and 11 (1%) anti-HIV positive (single infections); seven (1%) had more than one infection (three were HBsAg positive). Of the 801 HBsAg-negative patients, 373 (47%) were anti-HBc positive. The HBsAg-positivity rate was high (14%; 62/444) in individuals from sub-Saharan Africa and intermediate in those from eastern Europe (6%; 12/198), northern Africa (2%; 2/80) and Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka (the 'India-Pakistan area') (3%; 4/126). Anti-HCV was detected in 9/126 (7%) individuals originating from the India-Pakistan area, in 12/198 (6%) from eastern Europe, in 17/444 (4%) from sub-Saharan and in 2/80 (2%) from northern Africa. The HBV, HCV and HIV infections in the undocumented migrants and refugees screened serve as a reminder to the Italian healthcare authorities to carry out extensive screening and educational programmes for these populations.

97,0.002,2.0,"Cambodian Americans have an elevated risk of liver cancer. This health disparity is attributable to high rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Our study examined factors associated with HBV testing among Cambodian men and women. A population-based survey was conducted in the Seattle area. The Health Behavior Framework guided our survey instrument development. We attempted to interview a man and a woman in each household. The sample included 300 men and 367 women. About one-half of the male (45%) and female (54%) respondents had been tested for HBV. Two factors were independently associated with testing among men and women: a doctor had recommended testing and had asked a doctor for testing. Knowing that someone who looks and feels healthy can spread HBV was independently associated with testing among men. Low levels of HBV testing remain a public health problem among Cambodians. Interventions should improve patient-provider communication by encouraging providers who serve Cambodians to recommend HBV testing, as well as by empowering Cambodians to ask for testing."

Two of the three patients had acute myeloid leukemia and the other one acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two of the patients were known with HIV infection; the third was diagnosed on admission. All patients received antiretroviral therapy with standard doses of lamivudine, stavudine and efavirenz or lopinavir/retonavir. All three were diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis on one or more occasions: pulmonary or miliary involvement or tuberculous meningitis. One patient developed spinal paraplegia and needed an urgent laminectomy. Later he recovered almost completely.

8913,0.002,2.0,"To assess the prevalence of major drug resistance mutations in antiretroviral (ARV)-treated patients with detectable viral load (VL) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, genotypic resistance testing was performed among treated human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) patients attending the University Malaya Medical Center between July 2003 and November 2004. The reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes from 36 plasma samples with detectable VL were examined for major mutations associated with ARV resistance as reported by the International AIDS Society-USA Drug Resistance Mutations Group. The prevalence of patients with at least one major mutation conferring drug resistance to nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs), non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was 77.8%. In the RT gene, the frequency of mutations associated with NRTIs and NNRTIs resistance was 52.8 and 63.9%, respectively, with M184V and K103N mutations being selected most frequently by these drugs. A patient with Q151M mutation complex was also detected. Twenty-two percent of the patients had mutations associated with PIs. The following pattern of prevalence of ARV-resistant HIV-1 variants was observed: NNRTI-resistant > NRTI-resistant > PI-resistant. The prevalence of major drug resistance mutations among ARV-treated patients with detectable VL is high in Kuala Lumpur. Genotypic drug resistance testing is therefore important for monitoring patients experiencing ARV regimen failure."
3394,0.002,2.0,"Characteristic pathological alterations of the liver in chimpanzees inoculated with non-A, non-B hepatitis sera have been described, but no corresponding findings have been reported in humans. Electron microscopic studies of the liver biopsy specimens of two homosexual patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, one without hepatitis (Patient 1) and one with chronic active hepatitis in remission (Patient 2), revealed the cytoplasmic tubular structures which are characteristic of chimpanzee non-A, non-B hepatitis. A cluster of 23 nm double-shelled particles was also seen in the cytoplasm of a hepatocyte in patient 1 who had received a blood transfusion 8 days before the biopsy. These particles were smaller than the Dane particles, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex virus, and different from hepatitis A virus particles; the antibodies to all of which are found in high concentration in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients. These observations may reflect the morphologic findings for non-A, non-B hepatitis infection in humans."
7965,0.002,2.0,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are virulent intracellular pathogens that invade and multiply within macrophages. The effect of M. tuberculosis on HIV-1 infection and replication was analyzed in vitro using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation. Preinfection of MDM with M. tuberculosis followed by HIV-1 infection resulted in an increase in p24 release, reverse transcriptase activity, and infective virus production. In contrast, no increase in HIV-1 production was observed when MDM were infected with Mycobacterium avium complex or heat-killed M. tuberculosis. Coinfected MDM were potent stimulators of T cell proliferation, while HIV-1-infected MDM failed to present exogenous tuberculin to T cells. Furthermore, coinfected MDM showed an increased capacity to transmit HIV-1 to activated T cells. These results suggest that M. tuberculosis infection can both up-regulate HIV-1 infection and replication within MDM and increase the efficiency of virus transmission from infected MDM to T cells."
571,0.002,2.0,"The prevalence of a G1862T variant of hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been investigated in patients with fulminant hepatitis and chronic liver disease, using primer mismatch amplification, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. This variant was five times more common in patients with fulminant hepatitis (13.7%, 7 of 52) than in chronic carriers (2.5%, 2 of 81). The G-->T substitution at position 1862 leads to an amino acid change in codon 17 of the precore protein of the virus, which is part of a signal peptidase recognition motif. Variants with this mutation were only seen in patients infected with genotype B. In vitro translation experiments showed that this variant has greatly reduced capacity to produce hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) from its precore protein precursor. Furthermore, 88.5% of patients with fulminant hepatitis had mutations that are known to be associated with abrogated or reduced production of HBeAg. This suggests that, following HBV infection, the absence or reduced amounts of HBeAg may be a contributing factor in fulminant disease."

Sub-Saharan Africa is affected by simultaneous epidemics of ocular infections and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Ocular infection and its complications, along with cataract and ocular trauma, are common conditions in this region with great impact on daily life. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and microbial aetiology of the most important infectious ocular conditions in sub-Saharan Africa: conjunctivitis, keratitis and uveitis. We focus specifically on the potential association of these infections with HIV infection, including immune recovery uveitis. Finally, challenges and opportunities for clinical management are discussed, and recommendations made to improve care in this neglected but very important clinical field. "
2100,0.002,2.0,"VRC01, a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody (bnmAb), can neutralize a diverse array of HIV-1 isolates by mimicking CD4 binding to the envelope glycoprotein gp120. We have previously demonstrated the presence of VRC01-resistant strains in an HIV-1 infected patient during antiretroviral therapy. Here, we report follow-up studies of two subsequent samples from the same patient. With genetic and phenotypic analysis of over 70 full-length molecular clones of the HIV-1 envelope, we show that VRC01-resistant HIV-1 continued to exist and change in its proportion of the infecting virus during treatment with a highly active antiretroviral therapy. Consistent with our previous observation, the resistant phenotype was associated with a single asparagine residue at position 460 (N460), a potential N-linked glycosylation site in the V5 region. The persistence and continuing evolution of VRC01-resistant HIV-1 in vivo presents a great challenge to our future preventative and therapeutic interventions based on VRC01. "
3867,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by persistent replication of a complex mixture of viruses termed a ""quasispecies."" Transmission is generally associated with a stringent population bottleneck characterized by infection by limited numbers of ""transmitted/founder"" (T/F) viruses. Characterization of T/F genomes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been integral to studies of transmission, immunopathogenesis, and vaccine development. Here, we describe the identification of complete T/F genomes of HCV by single-genome sequencing of plasma viral RNA from acutely infected subjects. A total of 2,739 single-genome-derived amplicons comprising 10,966,507 bp from 18 acute-phase and 11 chronically infected subjects were analyzed. Acute-phase sequences diversified essentially randomly, except for the poly(U/UC) tract, which was subject to polymerase slippage. Fourteen acute-phase subjects were productively infected by more than one genetically distinct virus, permitting assessment of recombination between replicating genomes. No evidence of recombination was found among 1,589 sequences analyzed. Envelope sequences of T/F genomes lacked transmission signatures that could distinguish them from chronic infection viruses. Among chronically infected subjects, higher nucleotide substitution rates were observed in the poly(U/UC) tract than in envelope hypervariable region 1. Fourteen full-length molecular clones with variable poly(U/UC) sequences corresponding to seven genotype 1a, 1b, 3a, and 4a T/F viruses were generated. Like most unadapted HCV clones, T/F genomes did not replicate efficiently in Huh 7.5 cells, indicating that additional cellular factors or viral adaptations are necessary for in vitro replication. Full-length T/F HCV genomes and their progeny provide unique insights into virus transmission, virus evolution, and virus-host interactions associated with immunopathogenesis."

1599,0.002,2.0,"There are few studies on health-facility based prevalence rates for dual hepatitis B virus-hepatitis C virus (HBV-HCV) infection on a state-wide scale in Nigeria. In this study we determined the state-wide prevalence rate of dual positivity of hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV antibody among hospital patients of Ekiti State, Nigeria, and identified associated factors. Consenting apparently-healthy patients visiting health centers in all local government area (LGA) headquarters of Ekiti State were consecutively selected to a total of 2000 individuals. Patient demographic data pertinent to HBV and HCV transmission were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Subsequently, serum samples prepared from the aseptically collected blood was tested for the presence of both HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody using DiaSpot test strips. The results were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Dual positivity of 7.40% was recorded among the study participants, with 9.80% and 12.80%, respectively, testing positive for HBsAg and anti-HCV antibody. The study patients were, however, most likely to be anti-HCV antibody positive. Nine of the 10 factors studied were independently associated with dual positivity. Five of these, in descending order of odds ratio, were: illiteracy (15.76, p=0.001); having ≥4 sexual partners (9.46, p=0.001); age range of 35-44 y (8.46,p=0.001); farming (7.33, p=0.001); and ""not at all"" to use of condoms during sexual intercourse (4.39, p=0.001). The dual positivity rate was relatively high, with unprotected sexual intercourse as the most probable mode of acquisition of HBV and HCV by the seropositive study participants."
5555,0.002,2.0,"One hundred and seventy five subjects with chronic liver diseases which included patients with chronic active hepatitis (90), liver cirrhosis (31) and asymptomatic hepatitis B carriers (54), were included in the study. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific DNA-polymerase activity and HBe-markers were tested as markers of HBV-multiplication. In HBsAg positive samples, DNA-P activity was positive in 44.4% of the HBV carriers, 52.9% of the patients with chronic active hepatitis and 81.8% of the patients with liver cirrhosis. The corresponding figures for the presence of HBeAg in these groups were 18.5, 26.5 and 45.5% respectively. Virus multiplication was also observed in 41.1 and 44.4% patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis respectively, in the absence of HBsAg. The results of the present study show that hepatitis B virus is the most important etiological factor of chronic liver diseases in India. Most of our patients of chronic liver diseases seems to have contacted HBV infection as young adults and the mode of transmission is likely to be horizontal rather than vertical. The virus replicating markers correlate well with the severity of the liver injury and decreased with the age. DNA-P activity is a more sensitive marker of viral multiplication than HBeAg. Viral multiplication was also found to occur in the absence of the usual HBV markers. Continued viral multiplication in patients with chronic active hepatitis and liver cirrhosis is implicated in continued liver injury and progressive liver disease."
8567,0.002,2.0,"From June to December 1985 273 cases of hepatitis and jaundice were diagnosed in Maun, northern Botswana. It was known before the outbreak that most adults were immune to hepatitis A virus, most had markers indicating past infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), there was a mean prevalence of 13.6% (57/418) HBsAg carriers, and a proportion of people had antibodies to hepatitis delta virus (HDV). There was evidence that faecal contamination of water supplies preceded the outbreak; the epidemic curve suggested that there was a major common source of infection; the disease appeared to have affected 1-2% of the population; 90.3% (214/237) patients for whom information is available were aged 20 years or older; the disease was generally mild and affected pregnant women most severely. 49 patients were admitted to hospital and at least 4/273 died. There were prevalences of 47% (28/60) HBsAg and 69% (37/54) anti-HDV reactors among patients bled 1-43 d after the onset of illness. The main features of the outbreak conformed to published descriptions of water-borne epidemic non-A non-B hepatitis and it is postulated that the disease was most severe in patients with active HBV infection and in those with HDV superinfection, so that such patients were disproportionately represented amongst those seeking medical attention."

Figures for HIV prevalence are among the highest in the world, but the number of people receiving treatment is very small. Economic and political factors contribute to this important health crisis. Opportunistic diseases as a whole and their relative frequencies of presentation in southern Africa are discussed, emphasizing the lead role of tuberculosis. The limited data that do exist regarding neurological complications in Zimbabwe are summarized, and combined with anecdotal experience from practicing clinicians. Opportunistic infections in the nervous system are very common, the most important being cryptococcal meningitis, causing half of all adult meningitis in the country. Tuberculous and bacterial meningitis have also become more common and carry a high mortality in HIV-infected people in Zimbabwe. Intracranial mass lesions, including tuberculoma, bacterial abscesses and toxoplasmosis encephalitis are less common and difficult to diagnose in the absence of stereotactic biopsy. Spinal tuberculosis and transverse myelitis are the most frequent causes of spinal cord opportunistic infections. Peripheral neuropathy is probably similar in presentation to that seen elsewhere, whereas dementia is less frequently recognized."
1035,0.002,2.0,"UC781, a thiocarboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT), inhibited RT DNA polymerase activity in vitro with marked potency. Significant inhibition was noted at a 1:1 molar ratio of UC871 to RT, characteristic of a tight-binding inhibitor. Infectivity of the HIV-1(IIIB) laboratory strain was eliminated in a concentration-dependent manner following short exposure of isolated virion particles to UC781. Neither nevirapine nor certain other carboxanilide nonnucleoside inhibitors were effective in this manner. Endogenous reverse transcription in UC781-treated virus particles was markedly reduced. Treatment of chronically HIV-1-infected H9 cells with UC781 did not alter virus production, but the infectivity of the virus produced by the cells during drug exposure was markedly reduced. Moreover, the infectivity of nascent virus produced by the UC781-treated H9 cells after removal of exogenous drug was dramatically attenuated. Similarly, pretreatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from HIV-infected patients abolished the infectivity of virus produced by these cells after removal of exogenous drug, as measured by coculture experiments with uninfected cord blood mononuclear cells, indicating the utility of UC781 against a variety of clinical HIV samples. Importantly, preincubation of uninfected MT2 cells with UC781 rendered these cells refractory to subsequent HIV infection in the absence of extracellular drug, an effect that persisted for several days following removal of exogenous drug. These unique properties of UC781 indicate that this nonnucleoside inhibitor may have considerable promise for use in retrovirucidal formulations to minimize the spread of HIV from infected to noninfected individuals."

The most potent inhibition was obtained with rC.dG and dA.dT as template--primers. With rC.dG, reversible slow-binding non-competitive inhibition was observed. [3H]L-697,639 bound preferentially to enzyme-template-primer complexes. This binding was magnesium-dependent and saturable with a stoichiometry of 1 mol of [3H]L-697,639 per mol of RT heterodimer. Displacement of [3H]L-697,639 was seen with phosphonoformate. In human T-lymphoid-cell culture, L-697,639 and L-697,661 inhibited the spread of HIV-1 infection by at least 95% at concentrations of 12-200 nM. Synergism between 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine or dideoxyinosine and either of these compounds was also demonstrated in cell culture. Based upon their specificity for HIV-1 RT activity, template-primer dependence on potency and ability to displace [3H]L-697,639; a tetrahydroimidazo [4,5,1-jk] [1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione derivative R82150 and the dipyridodiazepinone BI-RG-587 appear to inhibit RT activity by the same mechanism as the pyridinones."

The only triphosphate found in cells incubated with 1592U89 was that of the guanine analog (-)-carbovir (CBV). However, the in vivo pharmacokinetic, distribution, and toxicological profiles of 1592U89 were distinct from and improved over those of CBV, probably because CBV itself was not appreciably formed from 1592U89 in cells or animals (<2%). The 5'-triphosphate of CBV was a potent, selective inhibitor of HIV-1 RT, with Ki values for DNA polymerases (alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon which were 90-, 2,900-, 1,200-, and 1,900-fold greater, respectively, than for RT (Ki, 21 nM). 1592U89 was relatively nontoxic to human bone marrow progenitors erythroid burst-forming unit and granulocyte-macrophage CFU (IC50s, 110 microM) and human leukemic and liver tumor cell lines. 1592U89 had excellent oral bioavailability (105% in the rat) and penetrated the CNS (rat brain and monkey cerebrospinal fluid) as well as AZT. Having demonstrated an excellent preclinical profile, 1592U89 has progressed to clinical evaluation in HIV-infected patients."
9917,0.002,2.0,"We attempted to determine whether HIV-1 developed resistance to (--)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine ((--)-3TC or 3TC, lamivudine) in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection during therapy with 3TC. Genotypic analysis of HIV-1 strains isolated from 6 patients receiving 3TC revealed that as early as 2 months of therapy, HIV-1 developed a Met to Val amino acid substitution at codon 184 (Met184-->Val) in the reverse transcriptase-coding region of the pol gene. A detailed study of a series of HIV-1 strains isolated from a patient demonstrated that Met at codon 184 was first substituted with Ile by 2 weeks of 3TC therapy, followed by the substitution with Val by 8 weeks. All HIV-1 strains with the Met184-->Val substitution were profoundly less susceptible to 3TC (1800- to 5500-fold decreased sensitivity) as compared to pretherapy virus strains. These strains were also moderately less sensitive to 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (4.5- to 9-fold), but more sensitive to 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (2- to 14-fold). A decrease in viremia levels and an increase in CD4 counts were observed early in therapy; however, these changes were only transient. Our data suggest that reversal of such beneficial changes is associated with the Met184-->Val substitution of the pol gene of HIV-1. The data also suggest that 3TC, as a single agent, may induce virologic and immunologic improvement in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection, but only transiently."
1895,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) DNA in peripheral blood cells of HIV-1 infected individuals may be present as integrated and/or unintegrated DNA. Several reports have indicated that a major proportion of HIV-1 DNA in the asymptomatic phase is linear, full-length, and unintegrated and in the symptomatic phase either circular unintegrated or integrated in the host genome. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to detect single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions, reflecting the presence of unintegrated single-LTR circles. In vitro infection of a CD4+ T-cell line resulted first in the increase of single-LTR junctions followed by syncytium formation and a rise of p24 antigen production. The number of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions was further studied in two acutely infected individuals and in 21 long-term infected individuals. The number of single-LTR junctions was significantly correlated with CD4+ cell decline, p24 antigen expression, and total HIV-1 DNA content of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions were absent from PBMC containing other forms of HIV-1 DNA in four of nine non/slow progressors relative to 2 of 12 rapid progressors/AIDS patients. We conclude from our data that quantitative detection of single-LTR HIV-1 DNA junctions can be used as an early DNA marker of the transition from clinical latency to active replication in the peripheral blood."
8390,0.002,2.0,"Over the previous years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV-1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR)-specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV-1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E.coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV-1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from chromosomal integration sites of HIV-1-infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells. The presented data confirm Tre-recombinase activity on integrated HIV-1 and provide the basis for the non-genetic transient application of engineered recombinases, which may be a valuable component of future HIV eradication strategies."

A total of 54 such individuals presented for services. Thirteen individuals reported participating in shared needle usage for the administration of medication or vitamins, in addition to other known risk factors for HIV. Only one of these 13 individuals had access to nonemergency medical care. Additional research is necessary to determine the reasons for these needle sharing behaviors.

Alanine was substituted for serine at amino acid position 65 in the modified GFP, resulting in markedly increased fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm as compared to wild-type GFP. The replication kinetics of R7-GFP were identical to that measured with an isogenic, nef-negative strain lacking GFP. Expression of GFP by replication-competent HIV-1 allowed simultaneous quantitation of viral infection and cell surface CD4 levels, revealing rapid and nearly complete CD4 downregulation on R7-GFP-infected PBMCs."

Specimens of fasting blood and overnight urines were used to determine HBV carrier status and excretion of aflatoxin in the subjects surveyed. While the prevalence of hepatitis-B virus carriers showed moderate variability, there was a 500-fold range in urinary aflatoxin levels. Mean log-transformed levels of aflatoxin metabolites were similar in males and females and in HBV carriers and non-carriers. In the 8 townships, HCC mortality correlated positively with both area HBV carrier prevalence and mean aflatoxin levels. The primary analyses, however, were conducted at the individual level. Each subject's aflatoxin level was treated as the response variable in a multiple regression model, and the corresponding sex-specific area HCC rate was included as a predictor along with the individual's carrier status, age and sex; alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were also considered. In these analyses, a significant association was again observed between the marker of aflatoxin exposure and the background rate of HCC mortality. In females, the slope of the regression line was somewhat steeper in HBV carriers, but this pattern was not seen in males and formal testing yielded no statistically significant evidence of an interaction. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that aflatoxin plays an independent role in hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan."
67,0.002,2.0,"AbFew reports have shown the relationship between the distribution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA in CD4 subsets during acute HIV-1 infection and HIV disease progression. In this study, we enrolled two groups with distinct differences in disease progression. The CD4 counts of one group fell below 200 cells/μL within 2 years (rapid progressors), whereas the other group maintained CD4 counts above 500 cells/μL (slow progressors). We collected blood samples during Fiebig stage III-IV of the two groups, and sorted CD4+ naïve, central memory, and effector memory lymphocytes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify HIV-1 DNA of the subsets. We found that HIV-1 DNA content was higher in memory T-cells than in naïve cells in both groups, and a higher HIV DNA content was found in naïve CD4+ T-cells during acute HIV-1 infection in rapid progressors. This suggests that higher HIV DNA in naïve CD4+ T-cells may associated with rapid progression."

Early diagnostic methods are based on isolating the virus in culture or PCR but the sensitivity of this test is only 50% at birth, although rising to nearly 100% by 6 months of age. In the infant, the main characteristic of the disease is the existence of a subgroup (comprising 15 to 20% of the patients) that develops AIDS early, in association with opportunistic infection and encephalopathy in the first months of life. Treatment choices remain very limited, with the hope of eventual prevention of maternal-fetal transmission.

9426,0.002,2.0,"Recombinant clones of the carboxyl terminus of the major surface glycoprotein (MsgC) of Pneumocystis jirovecii are useful for analyzing serologic responses in humans. However, there is no standardized set of antigens in general use, which could lead to conflicting results. We have previously shown that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients with prior Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP+) responded more frequently and more strongly to a clone of MsgC than did HIV-1-infected patients without PcP (PcP-). Here we test three new clones of MsgC to determine the effect of antigenic sequence variation on immune reactivity in blood donors and HIV-infected patients previously analyzed for reactivity to our original MsgC clone. In Western blot analyses, PcP+ patients exhibited the highest frequency of reactivity to each MsgC clone, and the frequency of reactivity with all four MsgC clones together was significantly higher in sera from PcP+ patients than in sera from the other patient groups. Furthermore, in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we found that the PcP+ population had the highest level of reactivity to two of the four clones tested. One of the new clones could distinguish between PcP+ and PcP- populations, and two MsgC clones could distinguish blood donors from the other patient populations. The results show that inherent differences in MsgC amino acid sequence can affect recognition by antibodies independently of variations in protein length or patient population, and the utility of a clone depends on its sequence and on the populations tested."

Fourteen had chronic HBV infection of whom 12 initially were positive for HBeAg and HBV DNA; 11 remained positive during follow-up, whereas one seroconverted to anti-HBe and lost HBV DNA. Two patients with chronic HBV infection were initially negative for HBeAg and HBV DNA: one later had reactivated HBV replication and one cleared HBeAg following onset of hepatitis D infection. The last two HBsAg-positive patients had resolving acute HBV infection. Six of the 57 patients who initially were negative for HBV markers acquired HBV infection during follow-up. Four of these six patients developed chronic infection whereas two patients had acute subclinical resolving hepatitis. In addition, four patients became HBsAg positive with their last serum samples, possibly indicating reactivation of HBV infection following progressive immunological and clinical deterioration. None of the patients developed clinical symptoms that could be ascribed to HBV infection, and transaminase elevations were only sporadically recorded. It is concluded that acquisition of HBV infections is not infrequent in HIV-seropositive patients with immune deficiency. Furthermore, the course of both previously established chronic HBV infection and newly acquired HBV infection is modified in such patients, whereas reactivation of past HBV infection seems to be a rare event."
4605,0.002,2.0,"The role of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) during virus rebound in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy is poorly understood. Three patients in this study had NAbs to preexisting autologous HIV-1 and an episode of virus rebound after a prolonged period of virus suppression. To investigate the influence of NAbs on virus evolution, envelope genotypes of preexisting and rebound viruses were examined. Phylogenetic analysis of env (V1-V5) sequences indicated that rebound viruses had evolved from or preexisted in baseline populations. By use of envelope pseudotype viruses, rebound viruses were found to be significantly resistant to neutralization by autologous antibody in all 3 patients, indicating that rebound viruses were selected by NAbs. The site responsible for conferring neutralization resistance against autologous antibody was identified in the upstream C3 region in 2 of 3 patients."
2077,0.002,2.0,"Retroviral reverse transcriptase-associated RNase H enzymes are responsible for degradation of viral RNA, including removal of the tRNA primer after plus-strand strong-stop synthesis and cleavage of the polypurine tract primer. These activities are required for the complex viral replication and result in generation of the long terminal repeats. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNase H domain has been expressed independently of the polymerase domain and possesses Mn2+-dependent activity with a hexahistidine tag. The isolated domain maintains the ability to specifically remove a tRNA primer mimic. In this study, the substrate determinants for recognition of the cognate tRNA3Lys are defined. Model substrates were constructed which mimic the RNA-DNA hybrid obtained from plus-strand strong-stop synthesis. Deletion substrates containing only 12, 9, or 6 positions of the tRNA primer were capable of being cleaved by the isolated RNase H domain. Mismatch and bromodeoxyuridine mutagenesis analysis indicated that positions 2, 3, 4, and 6, when mutated, affected the specificity of RNase H activity. Substitution substrates indicated that positions 4 and 6 within the RNA primer were important for recognition and cleavage by the HIV-1 isolated RNase H domain. Moloney murine leukemia virus-HIV-1 hybrid substrates were constructed which demonstrated that changes to HIV-1 sequences at positions 4 and 6 were sufficient but not optimal for regaining cleavage by the isolated HIV-1 RNase H domain. Optimal site-specific cleavage between the terminal ribonucleotide A and ribonucleotide C requires additional sequences beyond the first six positions but less than nine."
7350,0.002,2.0,"This study evaluated the prevalence of hepatitis Delta virus (HDV) infections in various groups of HBsAg carriers including drug addicts and patients with hemophilia in the Federal Republic of Germany. HDV was found only occasionally (less than 1%) in individuals found HBsAg positive during an examination as potential blood donors or in hemodialysis patients, but in 3% in patients with chronic hepatitis and up to 50% in drug addicts and hemophilia patients. These findings are in agreement with data reported from other European countries. Presence of antibodies to HDV in two hemodialysis patients indicates the presence of HDV in this group and screening for HDV infections in hemodialysis units is indicated to prevent outbreaks of this disease in HBsAg-positive patients with possibly serious consequences."
4282,0.002,2.0,"Primary HIV-1 infection is a relevant period for its virological and epidemiological consequences. Most patients present a symptomatic disease that can be potentially serious, but neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of primary HIV-1 infection patients presenting neurological symptoms and to compare them with primary HIV-1 infection patients without neurological involvement. Retrospective case-control study (1:3) comparing primary HIV-1 infection patients with and without neurological involvement enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016. Matching criteria included age (±10 years), gender, year of diagnosis (±4 years), and Fiebig stage. The conditional logit model was used for comparisons. Fourteen out of 463 patients (3.02%) enrolled in the Acute/Recent Hospital Clinic PHI Cohort between 1997 and 2016 presented neurological symptoms. 28.5% of cases presented as meningitis and 71.5% as meningoencephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid showed non-specific findings, including pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance and increased protein levels. All cases required hospitalisation, whereas only 19% of the controls did. No other pathogen was identified in any case, but five patients initiated empirically antimicrobial treatment for other aetiologies until diagnosis was confirmed. CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly lower (p = 0.039) and plasmatic viral load significantly higher in the case group, compared to controls (p = 0.028). Risk factors, HIV-1 tropism, subtype distribution, and prescribed ART regimens were comparable between cases and controls. After 6 months on ART, 92% of cases had undetectable viral load, similar to controls, and CD4/CD8 ratio became also comparable between groups. All cases recovered rapidly with ART and were discharged without sequels. Neurological involvement during primary HIV-1 infection is unusual but serious, always requiring hospitalisation. Diagnosis is difficult because of the wide range of symptoms and similarities with other viral aetiologies. Neurological manifestations during primary HIV-1 infection are associated with a lower CD4/CD8 ratio and with a higher viral load than controls. Immediate ART initiation and rapid viral load decrease are required, allowing complete clinical recovery."
7071,0.002,2.0,"Efavirenz (EFV) is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor indicated for treatment of HIV-1 infection. Despite concern over EFV tolerability in clinical trials and practice, particularly related to central nervous system (CNS) adverse events, some observational studies have shown high rates of EFV continuation at one year and low rates of CNS-related EFV substitution. The objective of this study was to further examine the real-world rate of CNS-related EFV discontinuation in antiretroviral therapy naïve HIV-1 patients. This retrospective cohort study used a nationally representative electronic medical records database to identify HIV-1 patients ≥12 years old, treated with a 1st-line EFV-based regimen (single or combination antiretroviral tablet) from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2013. Patients without prior record of EFV use during 6-month baseline (i.e., antiretroviral therapy naïve) were followed 12 months post-medication initiation. CNS-related EFV discontinuation was defined as evidence of a switch to a replacement antiretroviral coupled with record of a CNS symptom within 30 days prior, absent lab evidence of virologic failure. We identified 1742 1st-line EFV patients. Mean age was 48 years, 22.7% were female, and 8.1% had a prior report of CNS symptoms. The first year, overall discontinuation rate among new users of EFV was 16.2%. Ten percent of patients (n = 174) reported a CNS symptom and 1.1% (n = 19) discontinued EFV due to CNS symptoms: insomnia (n = 12), headache (n = 5), impaired concentration (n = 1), and somnolence (n = 1). The frequency of CNS symptoms was similar for patients who discontinued EFV compared to those who did not (10.3 vs. 9.9%; P = .86). Our study found that EFV discontinuation due to CNS symptoms was low, consistent with prior reports."

3995,0.002,2.0,"Despite three decades of dramatic treatment breakthroughs in antiretroviral regimens, clinical outcomes for people living with HIV vary greatly. The HIV treatment cascade models the stages of care that people living with HIV go through toward the goal of viral suppression and demonstrates that <30% of those living with HIV/AIDS in the United States have met this goal. Although some research has focused on the ways that patient characteristics and patient-provider relationships contribute to clinical adherence and treatment success, few studies to date have examined the ways that contextual factors of care and the healthcare environment contribute to patient outcomes. Here, we present qualitative findings from a mixed-methods study to describe contextual and healthcare environment factors in a Ryan White Part C clinic that are associated with patients' abilities to achieve viral suppression. We propose a modification of Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization, and its more recent adaptation developed by Ulett et al., to describe the ways that clinic, system, and provider factors merge to create a system of care in which more than 86% of the patient population is virally suppressed."
4949,0.002,2.0,"Since the introduction of antiviral compounds such as lamivudine and famciclovir in the treatment schedules of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the accumulation of a variety of mutations in the HBV polymerase gene has been observed. The selection of these mutations is generally considered the cause of viral nonresponsiveness and treatment failure. Therefore, the detection of these mutations is of clinical importance. Previously genotyped HBV strains isolated from treated and untreated patients were amplified with primers specific for the HBV polymerase region from amino acids 465 to 562. Amplified products were cloned into plasmid vectors. The clones were used as reference strains. A set of 38 highly specific oligonucleotide probes covering three different codon positions, L528M, M552V/I, and V/L/M555I, were selected. These probes were applied as 19 different lines on a membrane strip. The strips were then hybridized with PCR fragments from the reference panel, revealing the amino acids at the three codon positions simultaneously for each clone. PCR products generated from two patients infected with HBV genotypes A and C, respectively, and treated with nucleoside analogs were analyzed on these strips. A gradual increase in genetic HBV polymerase complexity was observed in follow-up samples compared to that in pretreatment samples. Additional analysis of HBV polymerase DNA fragments in recombinant plasmid clones demonstrated the existence of (i) clones with double mutations, (ii) clones with single mutations at either codon 528, 552, or 555, and (iii) the simultaneous occurrence of two or more viral populations within one sample. This line probe assay detected the complex quasispecies nature of HBV and provided some insight into the dynamics of resistance mutations."
2989,0.002,2.0,"To improve the utility of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) vectors for gene therapy, the viral envelope needs to be manipulated to achieve cell-specific gene delivery. In this report, we have engineered an HSV-1 mutant virus, KgBpK(-) gC(-), deleted for the glycoprotein C (gC) and the heparan sulfate-binding domain (pK) of gB, in order to express gC:preS1 and gC:preS1 active peptide (preS1ap) fusion molecules. PreS1, and a 27 amino acid active peptide inside preS1 (preS1ap), are supposed to be the molecules that the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) needs to bind specifically to hepatocytes. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the gC:preS1ap fusion molecule was expressed and incorporated into the envelope of the recombinant HSV-1 virus KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap. Moreover, KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap recombinant virus gained a specific binding activity to an hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) with a consequent productive infection. In addition, anti-preS1-specific antibodies were shown to neutralize recombinant virus infectivity, and a synthetic preS1ap peptide was able to elute KgBpK(-)gC:preS1ap virus bound on HpeG2 cells. These data provide further evidence that HSV-1 can productively infect cells through a specific binding to a non-HSV-1 receptor. Furthermore, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the HBV preS1ap molecule is an HBV ligand to hepatocytes."
9964,0.002,2.0,"We developed a recombinant virus technique to determine the coreceptor usage of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from plasma samples, the source expected to represent the most actively replicating virus population in infected subjects. This method is not subject to selective bias associated with virus isolation in culture, a step required for conventional tropism determination procedures. The addition of a simple subcloning step allowed semiquantitative evaluation of virus populations with a different coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) usage specificity present in each plasma sample. This procedure detected mixtures of CCR5- and CXCR4-exclusive virus populations as well as dualtropic viral variants, in variable proportions. Sequence analysis of dualtropic clones indicated that changes in the V3 loop are necessary for the use of CXCR4 as a coreceptor, but the overall context of the V1-V3 region is important to preserve the capacity to use CCR5. This convenient technique can greatly assist the study of virus evolution and compartmentalization in infected individuals."
3526,0.002,2.0,"In Brazil, current trends of the AIDS epidemic include an increase in transmission through heterosexual contact, predominantly from men to women, with more cases of AIDS in women and more children contaminated by vertical transmission. There is also a high proportion of cases in poor people or people living in small towns. HIV-infected patients with high levels of immunodeficiency are frequently hospitalized after their first visit to the clinic due to opportunistic infections, characteristic of advanced disease. This study characterized the clinical and laboratory pattern of AIDS in a sample of patients attended for the first time in the AIDS clinic of the Federal University of Bahia Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador, Brazil. We revised medical charts of cases of subjects registered at the outpatient AIDS clinic from January 1997 to December 2003. The demographics, clinical data, and laboratory characteristics were analyzed to determine the degree of immunodeficiency at the time of admission. A total of 377 patients were evaluated (58.6% were male, with a mean sample age of 33.4 years). The most frequent clinical manifestations were asthenia, weight loss, fever, anemia, dermatitis, oral thrush and diarrhea. CDC criteria were not adequate to define the initial cases. After admission to the outpatient clinic, nearly 25% of the patients were hospitalized immediately, indicating delay in the diagnosis. In Bahia, the initial presentation of HIV-infected patients to health care assistance is occurring at a late stage of the disease, when signs and symptoms of immunodeficiency are already established. Efforts are necessary to construct strategies to make an early diagnosis of these patients, improve the quality of care, and guarantee the benefits of antiretroviral therapy, when it is indicated."
7357,0.002,2.0,"Individualized treatment on the basis of early viral kinetics has been discussed to optimize antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Individually tailored reduction in treatment duration in HCV type 1-infected patients represents one possible strategy. Four hundred thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5 microg/kg peginterferon alfa-2b weekly plus 800-1,400 mg ribavirin daily for 48 weeks (n = 225, group A) or an individually tailored treatment duration (18-48 weeks; n = 208, group B). In the latter group, treatment duration was calculated using the time required to induce HCV RNA negativity (branched DNA [bDNA] assay; sensitivity limit, 615 IU/mL) multiplied by the factor 6. All bDNA negative samples were retested with the more sensitive transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay (sensitivity limit, 5.3 IU/mL). Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were significantly lower in group B (34.6% versus 48.0% [P = 0.005]) due to higher relapse rates (32.7% versus 14.2% [P< 0.0005]). Important predictors of response were the levels of baseline viremia as well as the time to TMA negativity on treatment. Taking the simultaneous presence of low baseline viral load (<800,000 IU/mL) and a negative TMA test within the first 4 weeks as predictors for treatment response, SVR rates were comparable between both treatment schedules with an SVR probability of >80% obtained in patients treated for only 18 or 24 weeks."

We examine the demographic, background, and risk factors associated with HBV infection in this high-risk population. This paper presents a secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey and clinical data for 370 male veterans who were residents of a domiciliary care program for homeless veterans in Los Angeles, using chi(2), Fisher's Exact, and logistic regression analysis. About one-third (30.8%) of the sample tested positive for current or past HBV infection (ie, seropositive for either the HBV core antibody or surface antigen). After multivariate analysis, rates of HBV were significantly higher among veterans who were older, non-white, or who had a history of regular heroin use (a proxy measure for injection drug use), drug overdose, or drug detoxification treatment. The rate of current or past HBV infection among veterans in this sample (30.8%) was high compared to an estimated 5% to 8% of the general US population. Also, 3% of the sample were currently infected with HBV. Strategies for intervention include broader screening, immunization, and treatment interventions with this high-risk group."
6326,0.002,2.0,Chronic hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) cause a significant public health burden. Introduction of telaprevir (TVR) and boceprevir (BOC) has increased sustained virologic response rates (SVR) in genotype 1 patients but were accompanied by higher treatment costs and more side effects.

2988,0.002,2.0,"The benefit of routine HIV-1 viral load (VL) monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-constrained settings is uncertain because of the high costs associated with the test and the limited treatment options. We designed a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the use of routine VL testing at ART-initiation and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, versus our local standard of care (which uses immunological and clinical criteria to diagnose treatment failure, with discretionary VL testing when the two do not agree)."
8210,0.002,2.0,"HIV/AIDS has the highest mortality among infectious diseases in China. In ongoing efforts to alleviate this crisis, the national government has placed great emphasis on efforts in Henan province where HIV-infected former plasma donors in the 1990s contributed to AIDS becoming a public health crisis. Concomitant with a national initiative focusing the use of pharmacogenetics for the better prediction of treatment response, we studied genetic variants with known pharmacokinetic phenotypes in a set of 298 HAART-treated (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients infected with HIV from the Henan cohort. We measured the association of response to treatment, assessed as changes in CD4+ T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy, of five polymorphisms in four genes (CYP2B6, ABCB1/MDR1, ABCG2, and ABCC4) in which variation has been suggested to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly employed to treat HIV/AIDS. We show that genotyping for ABCB1 variations (rs1045642 and rs2032582) may help predict HIV treatment response. We found variations in this gene have a significant association with outcome as measured by CD4+ T cell counts in a discovery subset (N= 197; odds ratio (OR) = 1.58; 95% CI 1.02-2.45), these results were confirmed in a validation subset of the cohort (N = 78; OR= 2.81; 95% CI 1.32-5.96). Exploratory analysis suggests that this effect may be specific to NVP (nevirapine) or 3TC (lamivudine) response. This publication represents the first genetic analysis in a continuing effort to study and assist the patients in a very large, unique, and historically significant HIV-AIDS cohort. Genotyping of AIDS patients for ABCB1 variation may help predict outcome and potentially could help guide treatment strategies."
8295,0.002,2.0,"This study evaluated risk factors associated with prevalent HIV-1 infection among pregnant women in a semi-rural but densely populated area surrounding the town of Butare in Rwanda. Overall seroprevalence was 9.3% in 5690 pregnant women who sought antenatal care at one of five health centres. Factors associated with higher seroprevalence of HIV-1 included history of multiple sexual partners, history of at least one sexually transmitted disease (STD), relatively high socioeconomic status (SES), being unmarried, young age at first pregnancy, and low gravidity. Women who had used oral contraceptives, smoked more than one cigarette per day, whose partners were circumcised, and had had sex to support themselves were also at higher risk of being infected. A history of blood transfusion in the past 5 years was not associated with HIV-1 infection. History of multiple sexual partners, history of STD, high household income, partner circumcision, and past oral contraceptive use remained strongly associated with HIV-1 infection even when simultaneously controlling for other covariates. Among legally married women who lacked sexual behaviour risk factors, history of STD, high SES, young age at first pregnancy, and low gravidity were significantly associated with HIV-1 seroprevalence."

Patients were treated with 100% oxygen at two atmospheres of absolute pressure three times per week for two months, then two times per week on an ongoing basis. Laboratory markers were assessed monthly. All patients experienced relief of debilitating fatigue within one month of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. It was concluded that hyperbaric oxygen therapy is an effective adjunctive treatment in the medical management of HIV/AIDS. Laboratory markers, clinical significance, nursing implications, and cost-effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy are discussed."
1448,0.002,2.0,"The difference between regional rates of HIV-associated dementia (HAD) in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV suggests that genetic determinants exist within HIV that influence the ability of the virus to replicate in the central nervous system (in Uganda, Africa, subtype D HAD rate is 89%, while subtype A HAD rate is 24%). HIV-1 nef is a multifunctional protein with known toxic effects in the brain compartment. The goal of the current study was to identify if specific three-dimensional nef structures may be linked to patients who developed HAD. HIV-1 nef structures were computationally derived for consensus brain and non-brain sequences from a panel of patients infected with subtype B who died due to varied disease pathologies and consensus subtype A and subtype D sequences from Uganda. Site directed mutation analysis identified signatures in brain structures that appear to change binding potentials and could affect folding conformations of brain-associated structures. Despite the large sequence variation between HIV subtypes, structural alignments confirmed that viral structures derived from patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than to structures derived from patient sequences without HAD. Furthermore, structures derived from brain sequences of patients with HAD were more similar to subtype D structures than they were to their own non-brain structures. The potential finding of a brain-specific nef structure indicates that HAD may result from genetic alterations that alter the folding or binding potential of the protein."
5387,0.002,2.0,"We used a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a quantitative real-time PCR to determine the distribution of three enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) virulence-related genes in stool samples from hospital patients and school children in the Venda region of South Africa. At least one gene was found in 52 (16.5%) samples, 50 (19.6%) from hospitals and 2 (3%) from schools. The AA probe was found in 36 (69%), the aggR gene was found in 41 (79%), and the aap gene was found in 49 (94%) of all positive samples. EAEC was significantly associated with diarrhea and intestinal inflammation and was significantly higher (chi(2) = 5.360, P = 0.021) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive persons (29.5%) than in HIV-negative persons (13.7%). The presence of EAEC genes was significantly associated with occult blood (chi(2) = 30.543, P < 0.0001) in the stool samples. This study suggests that the clinical presentation of EAEC infection may be directly related to the bacterial load as well as to the genetic characteristics of the strains involved."
8176,0.002,2.0,"Two chimpanzees with persistent non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis were superinfected with marmoset-passaged MS-1 HAV. Two control chimpanzees were also infected with marmoset-passaged HAV. Neither animal with persistent NANB hepatitis developed elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, whereas both control chimpanzees exhibited ALT elevations within 3 weeks after inoculation. In addition, both NANB-infected chimpanzees demonstrated a delayed anti-HAV antibody response in which one animal failed to produce detectable IgM anti-HAV. With the exception of one stool, all serial liver biopsy specimens and daily stool suspensions from the superinfected chimpanzees were negative for HAV antigen. One chimpanzee with a chronic HBV infection was superinfected with non-A, non-B hepatitis and was shown to develop elevated ALT activity and hepatocyte ultrastructural alterations accompanied by a marked reduction in the titer of serum HBsAg. Our combined findings indicate that acute and persistent non-A, non-B hepatitis infections are capable of interferring with two distinctly different hepatotropic viruses. These results also suggest that in vitro detection of non-A, non-B hepatitis infection or virus(es) may be achieved by antibody-independent methodologies that employ the basic principle of viral interference."
3559,0.002,2.0,"The number of new HIV diagnoses is increasing in the western world and transmission clusters have been recently identified among men having sex with men despite Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy efficacy. The objective of this study was to assess temporal trends, epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics of primary HIV infections. A retrospective analysis of 79 patients presenting primary HIV infections from 2005 to 2012 was performed in Marseille University Hospitals, southeastern France. Clinical, epidemiological and immunovirological data including phylogeny based on the polymerase gene were collected. 65 males and 14 females were enrolled. The main transmission route was homosexual contact (60.8%). Patients were mostly infected with subtype B (73.4%) and CRF02_AG (21.5%) HIV-1 strains. An increase in the annual number of HIV seroconversions among new HIV diagnoses from 5% in 2005 to 11.2% in 2012 (P = 0.06) and of the proportion of CRF02_AG HIV strains among primary HIV infections in 2011-2012 as compared to 2005-2010 (P = 0.055) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four transmission clusters including three transmission clusters among men having sex with men: two large clusters of nine CRF02_AG, six B HIV strains; and one small cluster of three B HIV strains. Clusters involved more frequently men (P = 0.01) belonging to caucasian ethicity (P = 0.05), with a higher HIV RNA load at inclusion (P = 0.03). These data highlight the importance of improving epidemiological surveillance and of implementing suitable prevention strategies to control the spread of HIV transmission among men having sex with men."
9170,0.002,2.0,"Perinatal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission is characterized by acquisition of a homogeneous viral quasispecies, yet the selective factors responsible for this genetic bottleneck are unclear. We examined the role of maternal autologous neutralizing antibody (aNAB) in selective transmission of HIV-1 escape variants to infants. Maternal sera from 38 infected mothers at the time of delivery were assayed for autologous neutralizing antibody activity against maternal time-of-delivery HIV-1 isolates in vitro. Maternal sera were also tested for cross-neutralization of infected-infant-first-positive-time-point viral isolates. Heteroduplex and DNA sequence analyses were then performed to identify the initial infecting virus as a neutralization-sensitive or escape HIV-1 variant. In utero transmitters (n = 14) were significantly less likely to have aNAB to their own HIV-1 strains at delivery than nontransmitting mothers (n = 17, 14.3% versus 76.5%, P = 0.003). Cross-neutralization assays of infected-infant-first-positive-time-point HIV-1 isolates indicated that while 14/21 HIV-1-infected infant first positive time point isolates were resistant to their own mother's aNAB, no infant isolate was inherently resistant to antibody neutralization by all sera tested. Furthermore, both heteroduplex (n = 21) and phylogenetic (n = 9) analyses showed that selective perinatal transmission and/or outgrowth of maternal autologous neutralization escape HIV-1 variants occurs in utero and intrapartum. These data indicate that maternal autologous neutralizing antibody can exert powerful protective and selective effects in perinatal HIV-1 transmission and therefore has important implications for vaccine development."
9478,0.002,2.0,"The functional status of circulating human immunodeficiency (HIV)-specific CD8 T cells in chronically infected subjects was evaluated. By flow cytometry, only 5 of 7 subjects had detectable CD8 T cells that produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with HIV-infected primary CD4 T cells. In 2 subjects, the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing cells increased 4-fold when IL-2 was added to the culture medium; in another subject, IFN-gamma-producing cells could be detected only after IL-2 was added. IFN-gamma-producing cells ranged from 0.4% to 3% of CD8 T cells. Major histocompatibility complex-peptide tetramer staining, which identifies antigen-specific T cells irrespective of function, was used to evaluate the proportion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells that may be nonfunctional in vivo. CD8 T cells binding to tetramers complexed to HIV gag epitope SLYNTVATL and reverse transcriptase epitope YTAFTIPSI were identified in 9 of 15 and 5 of 12 HLA-A2-expressing seropositive subjects at frequencies of 0.1% to 1.1% and 0.1 to 0.7%, respectively. Freshly isolated tetramer-positive cells expressed a mixed pattern of memory and effector markers. On average, IFN-gamma was produced by less than 25% of tetramer-positive CD8 T cells after stimulation with the relevant gag or reverse transcriptase peptide. In all subjects tested, freshly isolated CD8 T cells were not cytolytic against peptide-pulsed B lymphoblastoid cell line or primary HIV-infected CD4 T-cell targets. Exposure to IL-2 enhanced the cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells against primary HIV-infected CD4 targets in 2 of 2 subjects tested. These results suggest that a significant proportion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells may be functionally compromised in vivo and that some function can be restored by exposure to IL-2."

Drug adherence and outcomes were assessed in a subset of patients suspected of treatment failure based on discordant clinical and immunologic responses to ART. A total of 913 patients were included in this analysis, with a median time of 744 days (Q1, Q3: 511, 919 days) from ART initiation to viral load (VL) measurement. On aggregate over the period of follow-up, 531 (58%) had optimal adherence (MPR > or =95%), 306 (34%) had suboptimal adherence (MPR 80-94%), and 76 (8%) had poor adherence (MPR <80%). Of the 913 patients, 238 (26%) had VL > or =400 copies/ml when tested. When compared to individuals with optimal adherence, there was increasing risk for virologic failure in those with suboptimal adherence [adjusted relative risk (ARR): 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0, 1.6] and those with poor adherence (ARR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.4) based on MPR. During the antiretroviral treatment course, 676 patients (74%) reported no missed doses. The proportion of patients with virologic failure did not differ significantly among those reporting any missed dose from those reporting perfect adherence (26% vs. 26%, p = 0.97). Among patients with suspected treatment failure, a lower MPR was associated with higher rates of detectable viremia. However, the suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of MPR limit its utility as a sole predictor of virologic failure."

6105,0.002,2.0,"Cardiovascular diseases have become a significant cause of morbidity in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Heart transplantation (HT) is a well-established treatment of end-stage heart failure (ESHF) and is performed in selected HIV-infected patients in developed countries. Few data are available on the prognosis of HIV-infected patients undergoing HT in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) because current evidence is limited to small retrospective cohorts, case series, and case reports. Many HT centers consider HIV infection to be a contraindication for HT; however, in the era of cART, HT recipients with HIV infection seem to achieve satisfactory outcomes without developing HIV-related events. Consequently, selected HIV-infected patients with ESHF who are taking effective cART should be considered candidates for HT. The present review provides epidemiological data on ESHF in HIV-infected patients from all published experience on HT in HIV-infected patients since the beginning of the epidemic. The practical management of these patients is discussed, with emphasis on the challenging issues that must be addressed in the pretransplant (including HIV criteria) and posttransplant periods. Finally, proposals are made for future management and research priorities. "
6021,0.002,2.0,"We have tested whether breakdown of phosphatidylcholine (PC) initiated by exogenous addition of a PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) from Bacillus cereus or by endogenous overexpression of PC-PLC induces functional activation of NF-kappa B and increases human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enhancer activity. PC-PLC-activated hydrolysis of PC was found to induce bona fide p50/p65 NF-kappa B binding activity in three different cell lines of human or murine origin. No significant changes in the turnover of other cellular phospholipids were detected in PC-PLC-treated cells. Induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC did not depend on de novo synthesis of proteins or autocrine secretion of either tumor necrosis factor or interleukin 1. In human monocytic and lymphoblastoid T-cell lines, induction of NF-kappa B by PC-PLC resulted in clear induction of luciferase expression vectors placed under the control of synthetic kappa B enhancers or wild type, but not kappa B-mutated, HIV long terminal repeat constructs. HIV replication was increased by PC-PLC in chronically infected monocytes and T lymphocytes. NF-kappa B activation promoted by addition of exogenous PC-PLC correlated with an intense production of diacylglycerol. However, addition of a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC from B. cereus also induced diacylglycerol but did not activate kappa B enhancer-directed vectors. PC-PLC-induced NF-kappa B activation could not be blocked by a specific inhibitor of phorbol ester-inducible protein kinases C. These results indicate that a cellular transduction pathway, dependent on specific PC breakdown, is functional in T lymphocytes and monocytes and may be used by various transmembrane receptors to activate HIV transcription through NF-kappa B-dependent induction of the HIV enhancer."

Over a one-year period, 35 patients with pyomyositis, 20 male and 15 female, mean age 28.31 years, were admitted to Dr Ambrosoli Memorial Hospital of Kalongo (Kitgum District, Northern Uganda). Among these patients, II were HIV-antibody-positive, with a seroprevalence of 31.42%. In the age and sex-matched control group of 35 healthy subjects, selected in the same period from volunteers admitted to the surgical ward for orthopaedic trauma, two were HIV-antibody-positive, with a seroprevalence of 5.71%. The matched analysis produced a Mantel-Haenszel matched odds ratio of 5.50 and a maximum likelihood estimate of OR (MLE) of 5.50 (exact 95% confidence limits for MLE = 1.20 < OR < 51.07). Among the II HIV-seropositive patients, 9 (81.8%) fulfilled the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition (CCD) for AIDS, compared with I of twenty-four (4.1%) HIV-negatives. The chi-square test for difference in fulfilling the CCD for AIDS between patients with pyomyositis seropositive and seronegative gave a statistically significant result (P < 0.0001). The authors conclude that pyomyositis is a bacterial infection very significantly associated with HIV infection, to be considered a strong sign of stage III-IV of HIV disease."

Not surprising therefore overall, drug users were the heaviest users of the inpatient facilities (74% of the discharges and 65% of the bed days) although homosexuals had the highest discharge rate (114 per 100 person years) and rate of bed day use (1654 days per 100 person years). Immunodeficiency (CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) and a clinical diagnosis of AIDS were both associated with greater inpatient and outpatient resource use compared to those without immunodeficiency (CD4 count > or = 200 CD4 cells/ul) or AIDS. Gender effects were complex; the ALOS for women was increased for all risk groups whatever the CD4 count whilst there was no consistent trend of more resource use for women by risk group. Drug users were the heaviest overall users of the local hospice (84% of all admissions, 83% of the bed days and a discharge rate of 76.4 per 100 person years), more than double the rates experienced by the other risk groups. Thus both clinical and immunological staging (AIDS or a CD4 count < 200 cells/ul) were associated with increased resource use in HIV infection and estimates of resource use for AIDS need to be increased by around one-third to take into account hospice use. Despite the preponderance of drug users in Edinburgh, comparisons with other centres did not reveal increased resource use."

Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is defined in a patient with the presence of HBV-DNA but a lack of HBsAg in the serum and hepatocytes. OBI can be considered as a high potential risk factor for inducing post transfusion hepatitis (PTH), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cirrhosis, and reactivation of the HBV. Recently, several investigations from various regions of the world have reported PTH as well as HCC and cirrhosis among blood recipients with diseases such as thalassemia and other disorders requiring regular hemodialysis. This form of hepatitis also causes complications for individuals that are co-infected with other viruses such as HCV and HIV. Because of its extreme disease potential, OBI can be considered a high risk for PTH, HCC, and cirrhosis. Therefore, an understanding of the prevalence of OBI among blood donors is a critical strategy in most transfusion services. This review addresses the recent information regarding the prevalence of OBI worldwide, with an additional focus on Iranian blood donors."
4279,0.002,2.0,"Covalent linkage of myristic acid to the N-terminal glycine residue of Pr55gag, the precursor of the major structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), facilitates an essential step in virus assembly and propagation. Substitution of the myristoyl-acceptor glycine with alanine, in a functional clone of HIV-1, eliminates virus replication. Complementation of this defect, in trans, restores infectious particle production. The nonmyristoylated (myr-) gag precursor accumulates in infected cells and is not processed into the mature capsid components of the intact virion. However, myr- Pr55gag can be processed by purified HIV protease in vitro, demonstrating that the myristoyl moiety is not required for cleavage by the protease. Myristoylation of Pr55gag is not necessary for localization but is required for stable membrane association and assembly of HIV-1."

However, the mechanism of those effects remained unclear. Here, we report on enhanced cytotoxicity of the lentiviral lytic peptide I (LLP-I) of gp41, the envelope transmembrane glycoprotein of HIV-1, in the presence of gamma-GCE. Without gamma-GCE, the cytotoxic effect of LLP-I was transient, whereas with gamma-GCE, cell death induced by LLP-I remained continuous until termination. Of note, such effects by gamma-GCE were also observed with another unrelated amphipathic peptide toxin, melittin. These results suggest that the synergistic cytotoxic effect of gamma-GCE and LLP-I may play a central role in the molecular mechanism of the selective cytotoxicity of gamma-GCE in HIV-1-infected T lymphocytic cells."

In this scenario, a precise knowledge of the situation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HCV chronic co-infection is required to adequately address this disease. This cross-sectional study was performed in 21 hospitals in Andalusia (Spain). The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients with an active HCV chronic infection who were not receiving HCV treatment at the time of inclusion. A total of 13,506 HIV-infected patients were included in the study. Of them, 2561 (18.9 %) presented chronic HCV infection. The majority of the patients included were on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART; 96.2 %), showed plasma levels with an undetectable HIV viral load (92.5 %), and had a good immunological status (median CD4+ cell count of 486 cells/mL). The HCV genotype distribution was as follows: 58.1 % were genotype 1, 1.1 % were genotype 2, 16.1 % were genotype 3, and 22.1 % were genotype 4 (2.6 % were missing data). In total, 24.8 % of the patients showed liver fibrosis stage F0-F1, 27.9 % showed stage F2, 16.7 % showed stage F3, and 21 % showed stage F4 (9.6 % were missing data). With regards to previous HCV treatment experiences, 68.05 % of the patients were naïve and 31.95 % had failed to respond to a previous treatment. The burden of HCV/HIV co-infected patients in our population was reported as one in five HIV-infected patients requiring HCV treatment.

About 25% of these chronic carriers evolve towards liver cirrhosis, a disease that is significantly associated with reduced survival and quality of life. Antiviral therapy can eradicate the infection - a process that is associated with a reduced disease progression rate. Several oral direct agents have been developed and tested for the treatment of HCV infection. This review focuses on the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and resistance of GS-9669, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of viral polymerase, active against HCV genotype 1. In combination with other oral antivirals, GS-9669 results: in very high rates of viral eradication (90-100%) in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, with a good tolerability and safety profile. In conclusion, GS-9669 is a good candidate to be used in interferon-free combinations for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. "

We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for hepatotoxicity among patients coinfected with tuberculosis and HIV in two hospitals in Recife, Pernambuco State, Brazil. The sample consisted of 57 patients (36.5% of the total) who developed hepatotoxicity and a control group of 99 patients (63.5% of the total), who did not present this effect. Hepatotoxicity consisted of jaundice or a high concentration of AST/ALT or total bilirubinemia. Multivariate logistic regression showed that a T CD4+ count of < 200 cells/mm(3) increased the risk of hepatotoxicity by a factor of 1.233 (p < 0.001) and that coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus increased this risk by a factor of 18.187 (p = 0.029). Discharge occurred among 66.1% of the case group (p = 0.026). The absence of hepatotoxicity was a protective factor against death (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.20-0.91).

Reverse transcriptase (RT) is a crucial enzyme in the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), and thereby has been the prime drugs target for antiretroviral (ARV) therapy against AIDS. To date, two classes of RT inhibitors (RTIs), e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and a lot of compounds tested as RTIs have been described. To our knowledge, bis(heteroaryl)piperazines (BHAPs) have been considered as one class of promising NNRTIs, such as structurally and chemically related NNRTI delavirdine, which was approved by the U.

This patient was found to have a non-sense mutation in the second codon of the pre-C region of the hepatitis B virus genome after her anti-HBe seroconversion but not in her serum when she was HBeAg+. As controls, serial blood specimens were analyzed from 12 other American patients who spontaneously converted from HBeAg to anti-HBe, who underwent an interferon alfa-associated HBeAg to anti-HBe seroconversion, and who did not seroconvert with interferon alfa therapy. No mutations in the pre-C region were observed to arise in these individuals. In conclusion, non-sense mutations that occur in the pre-C region in locations other than the 28th codon can be associated with HBeAg negative progressive liver disease. This report of a non-sense mutation occurring over time is unusual in that it occurred in a white American patient."

This work was carried out to study the effect of HCV-induced liver cirrhosis on NO levels among Egyptian patients. The study included 46 patients with liver cirrhosis, and 30 healthy individuals of matched age and sex. NO levels determined as the stable endproduct nitrate, showed a statistically significant increase among patients compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, NO levels increased proportionally with the severity of liver cirrhosis as assessed by Child's classification (P < 0.05). Moreover, schistosomial infection enhanced NO levels in cirrhotic patients with HCV infection compared to non-bilharzial patients (P < 0.001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and branched DNA assays were used for detection of HCV RNA positivity, and measurement of the virus load, respectively. Both showed a positive correlation with the NO levels (P < 0.001). At a nitrate cutoff value of 70 micromol/L, the sensitivity and specificity were 83.0% and 73.0%, respectively. Chi square analysis showed a significant correlation between ALT levels and both HCV RNA positivity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (P < 0.02), and virus load (P<0.05). Interestingly enough, there was a significant positive correlation between HCV RNA and schistosomal antibody titer as measured by hemaglutination inhibition assay (HAI) (P < 0.05). The data presented in this report indicated an association between NO levels and the development and progression of liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, the findings obtained from this study demonstrated that schistomiasis is an important risk factor involved in enhancement of NO levels and virus replication. The latter may aggravate liver cell injury and hence the development of cirrhosis."
9690,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a significant cause of morbidity. The requirements for HIV adaptation to the CNS for neuropathogenesis and the value of CSF virus as a surrogate for virus activity in brain parenchyma are not well established. We studied 18 HIV-infected subjects, most with advanced immunodeficiency and some neurocognitive impairment but none with evidence of opportunistic infection or malignancy of the CNS. Clonal sequences of C2-V3 env and population sequences of pol from HIV RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma were correlated with clinical and virologic variables. Most (14 of 18) subjects had partitioning of C2-V3 sequences according to compartment, and 9 of 13 subjects with drug resistance exhibited discordant resistance patterns between the two compartments. Regression analyses identified three to seven positions in C2-V3 that discriminated CSF from plasma HIV. The presence of compartmental differences at one or more of the identified positions in C2-V3 was highly associated with the presence of discordant resistance (P = 0.007), reflecting the autonomous replication of HIV and the independent evolution of drug resistance in the CNS. Discordance of resistance was associated with severity of neurocognitive deficits (P = 0.07), while low nadir CD4 counts were linked both to the severity of neurocognitive deficits and to discordant resistance patterns (P = 0.05 and 0.09, respectively). These observations support the study of CSF HIV as an accessible surrogate for HIV virions in the brain, confirm the high frequency of discordant resistance in subjects with advanced disease in the absence of opportunistic infection or malignancy of the CNS, and begin to identify genetic patterns in HIV env associated with adaptation to the CNS."

Recently, with increasing use of PCP prophylaxis and multidrug antiretroviral therapy, the clinical manifestations of HIV infection have changed dramatically and the predictors of inpatient mortality for PCP may have also changed. We developed a new staging system for predicting inpatient mortality for patients with HIV-associated PCP admitted between 1995 and 1997. Trained abstractors performed chart reviews of 1,660 patients hospitalized with HIV-associated PCP between 1995 and 1997 at 78 hospitals in seven metropolitan areas in the United States. The overall inpatient mortality rate was 11.3%. Hierarchically optimal classification tree analysis identified an ordered five-category staging system based on three predictors: wasting, alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaPO(2)), and serum albumin level. The mortality rate increased with stage: 3.7% for Stage 1, 8.5% for Stage 2, 16.1% for Stage 3, 23.3% for Stage 4, and 49.1% for Stage 5. This new staging system may be useful for severity of illness adjustment in the current era while exploring current variation in HIV-associated PCP inpatient mortality rates among hospitals and across cities."

We compared clinicopathologic variables of patients who were treated in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HAART eras and investigated whether exposure to antiretroviral agents with differing cerebrospinal fluid penetrations was associated with risk for PCL. All statistical tests were two-sided. Incidence of PCL was lower in the HAART era (1.2 cases per 1000 patient-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.8 to 1.9) than in the pre-HAART era (three cases per 1000 years, 95% CI = 2.1 to 4.0; P<.001), and overall survival was longer (median survival = 32 days, range = 5-315 days, versus 48 days, range = 15-1136 days; log rank P = .03). In the HAART era, fewer patients had prior acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illnesses than in the pre-HAART era (64% versus 90%; P = .013), and patients were more likely to have the diagnosis of PCL confirmed histologically or by polymerase chain reaction (77% versus 26%; P<.001).

Numerous in-house assays have been developed for the quantification of the different cellular HIV-1 DNA forms; these implement conventional or real-time PCR methodology. In this review we discuss recent findings about the longitudinal monitoring of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA in naïve and pre-treated patients, as a marker for clinical progression, treatment initiation and long-term success of HAART. These findings underline the importance of monitoring HIV-1 DNA in clinical practice, in addition to HIV-RNA and CD4(+) T Cell counts, for the better assessment of HIV-treatment and disease progression. The lack of a standardized real-time PCR assay is major impediment to more wide-spread HIV-1 DNA monitoring."
9525,0.002,2.0,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most prevalent AIDS-associated tumour, occurring in 20-30% of HIV-1-infected individuals in the early 1980s. The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced the incidence of the disease and might therefore support the concept of 'opportunistic malignancies' requiring immune impairments to occur. The relationship between the immune system and the epidemiology of this virus-induced tumour is of importance in order to identify new therapeutic approaches for treating or preventing its occurrence. As a model of impaired angiogenesis, therapeutic options for treating AIDS patients with KS should therefore target cell division, anti-angiogenic processes, immune modulators, cytokines and potentially antiviral drugs."

The distribution of these CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes was examined among 703 participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the District of Columbia Gay (DCG) Study, and the San Francisco Men's Health Study (SFMHS). Highly exposed and persistently seronegative (HEPS; n = 90) Caucasian men from MACS more frequently carried heterozygous G*2 (Delta32) genotypes (especially A/G*2) and less frequently carried the homozygous E/E genotype compared with 469 Caucasian seroconverters (SCs) from the same cohort (P = 0.004 to 0.042). Among 341 MACS Caucasian SCs with 6- to 12-month human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroconversion intervals and no potent antiretroviral therapy, mean plasma HIV-1 RNA level during the initial 42 months after seroconversion was higher in carriers of the E/E genotype and lower in those with the 64I-bearing haplotype F*2 or the Delta32-bearing haplotype G*2 (and especially genotypes A/G*2 and F*2/G*2). A multivariable model containing these CCR markers showed significant composite effects on HIV-1 RNA at each of four postconversion intervals (P = 0.0004 to 0.050). In other models using time to AIDS as the endpoint, the same markers showed more modest contributions (P = 0.08 to 0.24) to differential outcome during 11.5 years of follow-up. Broadly consistent findings in the larger MACS Caucasian SCs and the smaller groups of MACS African-American SCs and the DCG and SFMHS Caucasian SCs indicate that specific CCR2-CCR5 haplotypes or genotypes mediate initial acquisition of HIV-1 infection, early host-virus equilibration, and subsequent pathogenesis."
3520,0.002,2.0,"It is now generally accepted that mono- and bitherapy for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection are only transiently efficient mainly due to virus drug resistance. To obtain a sustained benefit from antiviral therapy, current guidelines recommend at least triple-drug combinations, or the so-called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In some patients, HAART can be problematic, either because it is difficult to remain compliant or because previous suboptimum therapies have limited the choice of drugs. For compliant drug-naive patients, HAART should be able to offer long-term virus suppression, when changing from first- to second- to third-line HAART at drug failure. Long-term treatment might ultimately result in multi-drug resistant virus leaving few options for salvage therapy. HIV drug resistance testing to guide this salvage therapy and the development of new drugs to allow new options will therefore remain priorities in anti-HIV drug research."
9353,0.002,2.0,"It has been previously shown that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection of HeLa cells results in augmentation of gene expression directed by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR). This effect is presumably mediated by protein interactions with the LTR. We have used two different assays of DNA-protein interactions to study the HSV-induced activation of the HIV LTR. Activation of the HIV LTR is associated with increased protein binding to LTR sequences in a region including the NF-kappa B/core enhancer and the Sp1 binding sequences as monitored by an exonuclease protection assay. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that HSV-1 infection resulted in the induction of a nuclear factor(s) that binds to the NF-kappa B/core enhancer sequence. In addition to the activation of the HIV LTR, HSV induction of NF-kappa B activity may be important for the regulation of HSV gene expression during a herpesvirus infection."
7449,0.002,2.0,"The close association between AIDS and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is well known. Few studies are available that evaluate the profile of NHL in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who reside in Puerto Rico. The present study was performed in a cohort of 2,843 HIV-infected patients followed in the Retrovirus Research Center at Bayamón, Puerto Rico, evaluated between January 1992 until December 2000. NHL prevalence was determined and differences between AIDS defining and non-AIDS defining NHL were evaluated with the Fisher and ANOVA test. NHL prevalence was 0.9%. Nine (33%) were AIDS-defining (AIDS-d) NHL and 18 (67%) were non-AIDS-d NHL. Both groups were similar in gender distribution and mean diagnosis age. The median CD4+ T cell count at diagnosis was below 150/mm3 in both groups. Injecting drug use was higher in AIDS-d NHL patients and Homo-Bisexual contact was higher in non-AIDS-d NHL patients. Death rate in the first year after the NHL was 67% in the AIDS-d group and 56% in the non-AIDS-d group. AIDS-d NHL incidence decreased after the implementation of combined antiretroviral therapy in the cohort, a finding not seen in the non-AIDS-d NHL. In summary the study detected low NHL prevalence, with high degree of immunological damage at the time of the lymphoma diagnosis. Conversely dissimilar response to the antiretroviral therapies was also perceived in the incidence of the two NHL groups."
1863,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. While infection of macrophages by HIV-1 is generally not cytopathic, it does impair macrophage function. In this study, we examined the effect of HIV-1 infection on intracellular signaling in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) stimulated with the growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is an important growth factor for cells of both the macrophage and granulocyte lineages and enhances effector functions of these cells via the heterodimeric GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR). A major pathway which mediates the effects of GM-CSF on macrophages involves activation of the latent transcription factor STAT5A via a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-dependent pathway. We demonstrate that GM-CSF-induced activation of STAT5A is inhibited in MDM after infection in vitro with the laboratory-adapted R5 strain of HIV-1, HIV-1(Ba-L), but not after infection with adenovirus. HIV-1 infection of MDM did not decrease the STAT5A or JAK2 mRNA level or STAT5A protein level or result in increased constitutive activation of STAT5A. Surface expression of either the alpha-chain or common beta(c)-chain of GM-CSFR was also unaffected. We conclude that HIV-1 inhibits GM-CSF activation of STAT5A without affecting expression of the known components of the signaling pathway. These data provide further evidence of disruption of cellular signaling pathways after HIV-1 infection, which may contribute to immune dysfunction and HIV-1 pathogenesis."
4288,0.002,2.0,"Clinical and subclinical mastitis increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 through breastfeeding. We hypothesized that a field test for mastitis used for bovine milk, the California Mastitis Test, would detect high cell counts in milk of HIV-infected women. We also investigated whether total milk cell count would positively correlate with viral HIV-1 RNA in the milk of 128 HIV-positive Zambian women. Mean cell counts in each California Mastitis Test scoring category were significantly different (p < 0.01, n = 232). In a subset of 4-month postpartum milk samples tested for HIV-1 RNA, viral RNA levels did not significantly correlate with total cell count (r = 0.166, p = .244). The CMT may serve as a screening tool for mastitis in breastmilk, but total cell count does not correlate with HIV-1 RNA levels. Since both cell-free and cell-associated virus are associated with increased risk of MTCT, investigation of the relationship between total milk cell count and HIV-1 proviral DNA is warranted before a conclusive determination is made regarding use of the CMT as a clinical screening tool to detect cases at high risk for breastmilk transmission."
7066,0.002,2.0,"Viral sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major health problem for women. Over many years the incidence of these infections has increased steadily to epidemic proportions. These infections not only cause short-term morbidity but also have been associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. This paper focuses on two of the most common viral STDs-Genital Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection of the female. The steady increase in the incidence of HIV infection and subsequent adult immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) among women requires health care providers to assume an active role in detection and treatment in order to avoid transmission, to protect the health of women with HIV/AIDS, and to reduce the risk of maternal-fetal (vertical) transmission. Because treatment with zidovudine has been shown to reduce vertical transmission, routine offering of HIV testing is currently recommended for all pregnant women. The approach to testing nonpregnant patients, i.e., the choice between selective screening or routine testing, rests with the individual clinician. Testing large numbers of patients within a practice may be facilitated by the availability of an oral antibody testing system. The sensitivity and specificity of the oral test is equivalent to blood testing. Serum and oral specimens are tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and confirmatory Western blot assays specifically designed for use with oral samples. Controversies in diagnosis as well as the most updated treatments for these infections are discussed."
6182,0.002,2.0,"Despite a decade of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity, a few individuals termed as long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) maintain a stable CD4+ T-cell count for a period of time. The aim of this study was to establish, through the sequential determination of all known predictors of HIV disease, the proportion of such patients having stringent criteria of true long-term nonprogression. Among 249 individuals who were HIV-infected and prospectively followed up over a 10-year period (1985 to 1995), 12 having a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 500/microL (LTNP I group) and 9 having a CD4+ T-cell count less than 500 but stable over time (LTNP II group) after at least 10 years of infection without intervention of antiviral therapy, were studied over the entire follow-up period. The plasma HIV RNA copy number and the serum concentrations of p24 antigen, each anti-HIV antibody, neopterin, beta-2-microglobulin, Immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were determined every 18 months over the study period. Cellular and plasma viremias were cross-sectionaly assayed in all 21 patients. Only two patients had strictly no marker of progression over the follow-up period. They were the only ones who had, over the 10-year period, a viral copy number too low to be detected. The other patients had a viral copy number higher than 400/mL at at least one visit and increasing over the follow-up period, and they evidenced one or more markers of virological or immunological deterioration. Cellular viremia was positive in all patients but two, while plasma viremia was negative in all but one. The population of individuals termed as LTNPs is not virologically and immunologically homogeneous. The majority present biological signs of HIV disease progression. A new pattern of true LTNP can be drawn through stringent criteria based on the whole known predictors. This pattern appears to be rare in HIV-positive population."
9988,0.002,2.0,"Variation at the IL-28B locus was recently reported to be a significant predictive factor of viral response to pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy against chronic hepatitis C. Predictive factors for the effect of therapy, including IL-28B polymorphism rs8099917 and viral and clinical factors were investigated. A total of 288 patients were enrolled who were chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b and treated with combination therapy. Among them, 87 patients completed 48 weeks of therapy without dose reduction or discontinuation. In multivariate regression analysis, the rs8099917 TT genotype was the only independent factor significantly associated with sustained viral response (P = 0.016, OR 61.5), whereas substitutions at amino acid 70 (aa 70) of the HCV core protein (P = 0.038, OR 5.9) and non-TT genotypes (P = 0.002, OR 17.2) were associated with nonvirological response. Both factors were also associated with viral dynamics during the initial stage of the therapy. Correlation analysis revealed that rs8099917 genotype was correlated with γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, hyaluronic acid, and HCV core aa 70. In conclusion, host (IL-28B polymorphism) and viral (aa 70) factors independently affect response to combination therapy."
3888,0.002,2.0,"The interferon (IFN)L4 polymorphism rs368234815 is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) spontaneous clearance and response to IFN-based treatments. The role of this polymorphism in HIV-1 infection is controversial. We investigated whether genetic variation at IFNL4 is associated to HIV-1 acquisition. The HCV protective allele TT was associated with decreased likelihood of HIV-1 infection in male intravenous drug users [odds ratio (OR): 0.3; P = 0.006], and this association was not modified by the genotype of CCR5. These results suggest that genetic susceptibility to HCV and HIV-1 infection shares common molecular pathways. "
8797,0.002,2.0,"We examined the association between IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphism rs12979860, hepatitis C virus (HCV) kinetic, and pegylated interferon alpha-2a pharmacodynamic parameters in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients from South America. Twenty-six subjects received pegylated interferon alpha-2a + ribavirin. Serum HCV-RNA and interferon concentrations were measured frequently during the first 12 weeks of therapy and analyzed using mathematical models. African Americans and whites had a similar distribution of IL28B genotypes (P = 0.5). The IL28B CC genotype was overrepresented (P = 0.015) in patients infected with HCV genotype-3 compared with genotype-1. In both genotype-1 and genotype-3, the first-phase viral decline and the average pegylated interferon-alpha-2a effectiveness during the first week of therapy were larger (trend P <= 0.12) in genotype-CC compared with genotypes-TC/TT. In genotype-1 patients, the second slower phase of viral decline (days 2-29) and infected cells loss rate, [delta], were larger (P = 0.02 and 0.11, respectively) in genotype-CC than in genotypes-TC/TT. These associations were not observed in genotype-3 patients."
291,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B and C virus infections are relatively common among patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients. These conditions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality after kidney transplant. Careful management of the transplant candidate by viral replication assessment and liver biopsy allows to achieve excellent kidney transplant results in these patients, also thanks to the antiviral therapies available today including pretransplant interferon for hepatitis C and nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors for hepatitis B.         Until recently, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was an absolute contraindication to solid organ transplantation. At the end of the 1990s, it became clear that HIV infection, once a fatal disease, could be effectively turned into a chronic condition by the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy. As a result, a growing number of HIV patients develop HIV-associated end-stage renal disease. For this reason we have to reconsider kidney transplant as a possible treatment option. During the last decade, the results of many studies have shown that transplantation can be safe and effective in these patients, as long as HIV infection is effectively controlled by antiretroviral therapy."
2006,0.002,2.0,"The objective of this study was to evaluate immune cytokine expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) using a novel cytokine array assay. HIV-1 induces a condition resembling classical subcortical dementia, known as HAD. The immune mechanisms contributing to HAD have not been elucidated. Cytokine expression in CSF was determined by solid-phase protein array in 33 neurologically asymptomatic HIV-positive male patients and were compared to levels in non-HIV controls and patients with HAD. Neurological examinations and lumbar and venous punctures were conducted in all patients and controls. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, and IL-10, were up-regulated in all treated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients independent of neurological status compared to controls. In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-1alpha, IL-15, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were highly expressed in patients with HAD compared to undemented HIV-positive patients. These results show that solid-phase protein array can detect immunological changes in patients infected with HIV. Cytokine expression levels differ in different disease stages and in patients on different treatment paradigms. Pending further validation on a larger number of patients, this method may be a useful tool in CSF diagnostics and the longitudinal evaluation of patient with HAD."
5665,0.002,2.0,"Since the introduction of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), solid organ transplantation (SOT) has become a therapeutic option for the HIV-positive population. In contrast with liver and kidney transplantation, only three simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (SPKT) have been reported among HIV-infected patients. Herein we have reported the first SPKT in an HIV-infected patient in Spain. The pancreas graft failed at 2 weeks and the patient died at 9 months because of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The three recipients reported in the literature lived, despite the failure of both the pancreas and kidney grafts in one subject. Despite the poor outcome of our case, HIV-1 infection was controlled after transplantation (stable CD4(+) cells and no AIDS-related events), and the kidney graft functioned with no episodes of rejection. The cART regimen used in the pretransplant period was switched at the time of transplantation to raltegravir and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI). Raltegravir has no interactions with immunosuppressive drugs. Target plasma levels of tacrolimus were achieved at a dose similar to that used in HIV-negative transplant recipients. The most adequate antiretroviral regimen for HIV-infected SOT recipients has not yet been established; however, one may consider switching protease inhibitors or non-NRTI-based regimens for a raltegravir-based regimen at the time of transplantation."
272,0.002,2.0,"The acyclic nucleoside phosphonates HPMPC (cidofovir), PMEA (adefovir), and PMPA (tenofovir) have proved to be effective in vitro (cell culture systems) and in vivo (animal models and clinical studies) against a wide variety of DNA virus and retrovirus infections: cidofovir against herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesviruses 6, 7, and 8), polyomavirus, papillomavirus, adenovirus, and poxvirus (variola virus, cowpox virus, vaccinia virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and orf virus) infections; adefovir against herpesvirus, hepadnavirus (human hepatitis B virus), and retrovirus (human immunodeficiency virus types 1 [HIV-1] and 2 [HIV-2], simian immunodeficiency virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus) infections; and tenofovir against both hepadnavirus and retrovirus infections. Cidofovir (Vistide) has been officially approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis in AIDS patients, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Viread) has been approved for the treatment of HIV infections (i.e., AIDS), and adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) has been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Nephrotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect for cidofovir (Vistide) when used intravenously (5 mg/kg); no toxic side effects have been described for adefovir dipivoxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, at the approved doses (Hepsera at 10 mg orally daily and Viread at 300 mg orally daily)."
808,0.002,2.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) are major sources of acute and chronic hepatitis. HDV requires the envelope proteins of HBV for the processes of assembly and infection of new cells. Both viruses are able to infect hepatocytes though previous studies have failed to determine the mechanism of entry into such cells. This study began with evidence that suramin, a symmetrical hexasulfated napthylurea, could block HDV entry into primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and was then extrapolated to incorporate findings of others that suramin is one of many compounds that can block activation of purinergic receptors. Thus other inhibitors, pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonate (PPADS) and brilliant blue G (BBG), both structurally unrelated to suramin, were tested and found to inhibit HDV and HBV infections of PHH. BBG, unlike suramin and PPADS, is known to be more specific for just one purinergic receptor, P2X7. These studies provide the first evidence that purinergic receptor functionality is necessary for virus entry. Furthermore, since P2X7 activation is known to be a major component of inflammatory responses, it is proposed that HDV and HBV attachment to susceptible cells, might also contribute to inflammation in the liver, that is, hepatitis."
5177,0.002,2.0,"CD8(+) T lymphocytes control human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by a cytotoxic major histocompatibility complex-restricted pathway as well as by secretion of noncytotoxic soluble inhibitory factors. Several components of CD8(+) cell supernatants have been identified that contribute to the latter activity. In this study we report that prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha), a protein found in the cell culture medium of the herpesvirus saimiri-transformed CD8(+) T-cell line, K#1 50K, has potent HIV-1-inhibitory activity. Depletion of native ProTalpha from an HIV-1-inhibitory fraction of CD8(+) cell supernatants removes the inhibitory activity, supporting its role in inhibition via soluble mediators. ProTalpha is an abundant, acidic peptide that has been reported to be localized in the nucleus and associated with cell proliferation and activation of transcription. In this report we demonstrate that ProTalpha suppresses HIV-1 replication, its activity is target cell specific, and inhibition occurs following viral integration. Native and recombinant ProTalpha protein potently inhibit HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression in macrophages. Furthermore studies using different promoters in lentiviral vectors (cytomegalovirus and phosphoglycerate kinase) revealed that suppression of viral replication by ProTalpha is not HIV LTR specific."

158,0.002,2.0,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) became more widely available in the Russian Federation in 2006 when the Global Fund made a contribution to purchase ART with a mandate to increase numbers of patients receiving it. Funds were distributed to AIDS Centers and selected hospitals, and numbers quickly increased. Though ART is highly effective for adherent patients, dropout has been a problem; thus understanding characteristics of patients who remain on ART vs. those who leave treatment may provide information to facilitate engagement. We retrospectively assessed depression, hopelessness, substance use, viral load, and CD4+ counts of 120 patients who dropped out of ART for ≥12 months (Lost-to-Care, LTCs) and 120 who continued for ≥12 months (Engaged-in-Care, EICs). As expected, LTCs had higher viral loads and depression, lower CD4+ counts, more alcohol, heroin, and injection drug use in the past 30 days. A binary logistic regression with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score, Beck Hopelessness score, whether drugs/alcohol had ever prevented them from taking ART, and past 30 days' alcohol use [χ(2)(4) = 64.27, p = .0.000] correctly classified 74.5% of participants as LTC or EIC, suggesting that integrated treatment for substance use, psychiatric, and HIV could reduce dropout and improve outcomes."
8590,0.002,2.0,"This study examined the prevalence and characteristics of attempted suicide among a representative sample of French Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. In 2003, a face-to-face survey was conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) selected in a random, stratified sample of French hospital departments. Among solicited individuals, 2,932 agreed to participate and were asked if they had ever AS. Among the respondents, 23% had AS. Female gender, younger age, native French citizenship, reporting household financial difficulties, having been HIV-contaminated through homosexual contact or through injection drug use and suffering from lipodystrophy-related symptoms were all independently associated with AS. HIV-discrimination and the lack of social support from family remained independently associated with AS. Our findings indicate a high level of AS among PLWHA and emphasize the multiple roles of factors associated with living with HIV, together with sociodemographic factors. The results enable the possibility for vulnerable groups to be targeted for specific future interventions in order to prevent attempted suicide."

Herein, we report the main clinical and virological features of cases reported in Spain. All individuals with HTLV-1 infection recorded at the national registry since 1989 were examined. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the long terminal repeat (LTR) region. A total of 229 HTLV-1 cases had been reported up to December 2012. The mean age was 41 years old and 61% were female. Their country of origin was Latin America in 59%, Africa in 15%, and Spain in 20%. Transmission had occurred following sexual contact in 41%, parenteral exposure in 12%, and vertically in 9%. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) was diagnosed in 27 cases and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) in 17 subjects. HTLV-1 subtype could be obtained for 45 patients; all but one belonged to the Cosmopolitan subtype a. One Nigerian pregnant woman harbored HTLV-1 subtype b. Within the Cosmopolitan subtype a, two individuals (from Bolivia and Peru, respectively) belonged to the Japanese subgroup B, another two (from Senegal and Mauritania) to the North African subgroup D, and 39 to the Transcontinental subgroup A. Of note, one divergent HTLV-1 strain from an Ethiopian branched off from all five known Cosmopolitan subtype 1a subgroups. Divergent HTLV-1 strains have been introduced and currently circulate in Spain. The relatively large proportion of symptomatic cases (19%) suggests that HTLV-1 infection is underdiagnosed in Spain."
8311,0.002,2.0,"Since modulation of the glutathione (GSH) level has been implicated in the regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transcription and expression, we have undertaken an analysis of the effect of sodium valproate (VPA) on HIV-1 replication. VPA, which is an anti-epileptic drug in widespread use in clinical medicine, has been shown to depress the activity of GSH reductase, an enzyme required for maintaining high cellular levels of reduced GSH. The effect of this drug on HIV-1 replication has been studied in primary infected cells, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte/macrophages, in the CEM-SS cell line, and in chronically infected stimulated and non-stimulated U1 cells. We have shown that VPA markedly enhanced viral replication in all infected cells tested. Virus production was induced in U1 cells by VPA treatment and the stimulatory effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor were augmented. The LTR-driven gene expression in Jurkat T cells was increased. However, the elevated viral production did not correlate with the effect of VPA on the intracellular GSH level. Thus, VPA stimulated in vitro HIV-1 replication in acutely and chronically infected cells and enhanced LTR-driven gene expression. These effects were observed for concentrations that are reached in the plasma of VPA-treated patients. Therefore, although the clinical significance of these data remains to be demonstrated, these results should be considered in the choice of an anticonvulsant drug in HIV-infected individuals."

Sociodemographic and clinical data and medical expenditures were obtained retrospectively from medical charts and computerized billing records. All 16 students were men who had sex with men, and 3 had also used intravenous drugs. Dermatologic conditions, upper respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal conditions, anemia, lymphadenopathy, sexually transmitted diseases, and ophthalmologic conditions were more frequent among HIV-infected students than among the general student population using the health center. On average, HIV-infected students visited the student health service about 3 times more often and incurred charges about 10 times higher than the general population of students visiting the health center. Student health centers, which have been at the forefront of developing strategies for HIV prevention, education, and counseling, must also develop treatment programs for HIV-infected students."

This cross sectional study was an attempt to determine the level and factors associated with HQoL among the people living with HIV. A convenient sample of 82 HIV-infected people from three NGOs and one Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), were interviewed using an interviewer administered, semi structured questionnaire developed by adopting the ""WHOQOL-HIV BREF instrument"". A majority of the respondents were with low Quality of Life (QoL) in all the domains of HQoL. The proportion of respondents with low QoL was highest in the domain of social relationship (64.6%) followed by psychological domain (59.8%), physical domain (58.5%), level of independence domain (56.1%), environmental domain (52.4%) and spirituality domain (52.4%) of HQoL. Bivariate analysis revealed that the overall perception of QoL was better in the respondents living in urban area, who were employed and asymptomatic of the centre for disease control (CDC) stage of HIV. The perception of overall health was higher in females, all respondents less than 35 years of age, asymptomatic of the CDC stage of disease and with a current CD4 count greater than 200 cell/mm3. These findings highlight the need for enhanced socio-psychosocial support and a better environment for improving the health related quality of life among people living with HIV."

The median diagnosed duration of HIV infection, similar in men and women, was 5 years, while the median CD4 count was 381 cell/mm. Age-standardized prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension was 38.6% (95% CI: 34.3-42.9), 46.3% (37.7-54.9), 76.4% (61.1-91.7), and 81.1% (62.9-99.3) in the overall sample; 40.0% (30.0-50.0), 36.3% (17.6-55.0), 84.8% (38.3-131.3), and 87.0% (38.2-135.8) in men; and 37.7% (32.9-42.5), 48.9% (38.9-58.9), 75.8% (59.1-92.5), and 81.3% (61.1-101.5) in women. Age and education were weakly associated with prevalent hypertension, while CD4 count and diagnosed duration of HIV infection were unrelated to prevalent hypertension.Similar to reports in the general population in this and other countries in the region, hypertension is frequent in young South Africans receiving care for HIV infection, with similar diagnostic and treatment gaps. Integrating HIV and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and care will, at least in part, reduce missed opportunities for implementing NCD prevention in HIV-infected people in care."
2374,0.002,2.0,"Currently available human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA quantification assays can detect most viruses of the group M subtypes, but a substantial number are missed or not quantified reliably. Viruses of HIV-1 group O cannot be detected by any commercially available assay. We developed and evaluated a quantitative assay based on nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) technology, with primers and probes located in the conserved long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the HIV-1 genome. In 68 of 72 serum samples from individuals infected with HIV-1 subtypes A to H of group M, viruses could be detected and quantified. In serum samples from two patients infected with HIV-1 group O viruses, these viruses as well could be detected and quantified. In contrast, the currently used gag-based assay underestimated the presence of subtype A viruses and could not detect subtype G and group O viruses. The discrepancy between the results of the two assays may be explained by the number of mismatches found within and among the probe and primer regions of the subtype isolates. These data indicate that LTR-based assays, including the NASBA format chosen here, are better suited to monitoring HIV-1 therapy than are gag-based assays in an era in which multiple HIV-1 subtypes and groups are spreading worldwide."
9080,0.002,2.0,"Elevation of the levels of circulating immune complexes frequently accompanies HIV-1 infection and is a prognostic indicator of clinical progression from asymptomatic infection to AIDS. Here we report that cross-linking of Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RII by adherent human IgG or by specific anti-Fc gamma R mAb activates HIV-1 gene expression in the human monocytic cell line BF24 and increased HIV RNA expression in monocytes from HIV infected patients as assayed by reverse transcription-PCR. In THP-1 cells, Fc gamma R cross-linking induced NF-kappa B, which is known to bind to the regulatory region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1 and to activate HIV-1 transcription. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody but not anti-IL-1 beta antibody strongly inhibited both the induction of HIV-1-LTR-driven transcription and the induction of NF-kappa B by Fc gamma R cross-linking. These results indicate that Fc gamma R can mediate a TNF-alpha-dependent induction of HIV-1 gene transcription and suggest that immune complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of HIV-1 infection by augmenting viral replication in monocytes."

Consenting adults underwent HIV testing, >/=2 sputum smears and cultures, and mycobacterial blood culture. Patients were defined as having TB on the basis of any positive smear or culture. Between January and September 2002, 465 of 498 consecutive patients consented to enrollment. A total of 384 patients (83%) were infected with HIV, and 175 (38%) had TB; the mycobacterial blood culture was the sole source of diagnosis for 26 patients (15%) with TB. Among the tests evaluated, the sensitivity was 0%-63%, the specificity was 39%-99%, the positive predictive value was 0%-39%, and the negative predictive value was 63%-65%. We conclude that the serodiagnostic tests evaluated in this study lacked sufficient sensitivity as sole tests for TB in this population."

This article presents a review of the available evidence on this subject, indexed in MEDLINE-PUBMED, BVS-BIREME, and BioMed Central. The review covers the definition, epidemiology, classification, and diagnostic criteria related to IRS. In addition, the clinical particularities of the most frequent etiologies are described, and a proposal for a therapeutic approach is formulated. The prognosis and future implications of this syndrome in the epidemiology of some infectious illnesses in the HIV-positive population are included. Several unresolved aspects are mentioned, such as those related to the pathophysiology of the condition, use of biomarkers for the diagnosis, and the need for evidence-based therapeutic algorithms to enable standardization of treatment for these patients."
4768,0.002,2.0,"Thrombocytopenia is a relatively frequent complication in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most frequent mechanisms of thrombopenia are destruction of half-filled platelets by immunocomplex and defects in production. We present two cases of severe thrombocytopenia associated to HIV infection. Case 1: A male patient, 45 years old with fever and diarrhea that lasted for 1 month that presented with thrombopenia of 3,000 platelets/mm3. After beginning zidovudine and lamivudine therapy, he normalized the platelet count in 5 days. Case 2: A male patient of 30 years old, who suffered during one day migraine, nausea, vomits and then seizures. A criptococccal meningitis was confirmed. Concomitantly he had a platelet count of 59,000/mm3. He started antiretroviral therapy with zidovudina and lamivudina, then was changed to didanosine plus stavudine plus nevirapine. After 6 months of severe thrombocytopenia, platelets count was restored to normal values. A literature review is presented."
688,0.002,2.0,"Tat is a multifunctional transactivator encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Tat transactivating activity is controlled by nicotinamide adenine nucleotide(+) (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of nicotinamide into NAD(+), which is crucial for SIRT1 activation. Thus, the effect of Nampt on Tat-regulated SIRT activity was studied in Hela-CD4-beta-gal (MAGI) cells. We demonstrated that Tat caused NAD(+) depletion and inhibited Nampt mRNA and protein expression in MAGI cells. Resveratrol reversed Tat-induced NAD(+) depletion and inhibition of Nampt mRNA and protein expression. Further investigation revealed that Tat-induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity was potentiated in Nampt-knockdown by Nampt siRNA compared to treatment with Tat alone. Nampt siRNA potentiated Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation in MAGI cells. Altogether, these results indicate that Nampt is critical in the regulation of Tat-induced inhibition of SIRT1 activity and long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation. Nampt/SIRT1 pathway could be a novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of HIV-1 infection."

A four-month follow-up was carried out in 221 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and in 40 staff members caring for the patients in 2 centers. 62 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 126 hemodialysis patients who transited through a center (HDT) were screened once. A questionnaire exploring risk factors was completed for each patient and staff member. Sera were tested for HIV I antibodies by ELISA (ELAVIA) and confirmed by Western Blot. Of the 347 HD + HDT patients, 4 were found to be positive. Of the 221 HD patients, 1 multi-transfused hemophiliac and 1 multitransfused Nigerian without other risk factors were positive in the first screening. Another patient seroconverted after transfusion during the study; no other risk factors existed and the donor has not yet been found. One of the 126 HDT patients had received infected plasma. No staff members or PD patients were positive. No transmission within centers, from patient-to-patient or patient-to-staff was evidenced. Although HIV I seems to be less infectious than HBV, precautions to prevent transmission of HIV I in dialysis centers should be maintained."
7180,0.002,2.0,"Identifying microbial pathogens with zoonotic potential in wild-living primates can be important to human health, as evidenced by human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and Ebola virus. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ancient retroviruses that infect Old and New World monkeys and apes. Although not known to cause disease, these viruses are of public health interest because they have the potential to infect humans and thus provide a more general indication of zoonotic exposure risks. Surprisingly, no information exists concerning the prevalence, geographic distribution, and genetic diversity of SFVs in wild-living monkeys and apes. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of SFVcpz infection in free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) using newly developed, fecal-based assays. Chimpanzee fecal samples (n = 724) were collected at 25 field sites throughout equatorial Africa and tested for SFVcpz-specific antibodies (n = 706) or viral nucleic acids (n = 392). SFVcpz infection was documented at all field sites, with prevalence rates ranging from 44% to 100%. In two habituated communities, adult chimpanzees had significantly higher SFVcpz infection rates than infants and juveniles, indicating predominantly horizontal rather than vertical transmission routes. Some chimpanzees were co-infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz); however, there was no evidence that SFVcpz and SIVcpz were epidemiologically linked. SFVcpz nucleic acids were recovered from 177 fecal samples, all of which contained SFVcpz RNA and not DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of partial gag (616 bp), pol-RT (717 bp), and pol-IN (425 bp) sequences identified a diverse group of viruses, which could be subdivided into four distinct SFVcpz lineages according to their chimpanzee subspecies of origin. Within these lineages, there was evidence of frequent superinfection and viral recombination. One chimpanzee was infected by a foamy virus from a Cercopithecus monkey species, indicating cross-species transmission of SFVs in the wild. These data indicate that SFVcpz (i) is widely distributed among all chimpanzee subspecies; (ii) is shed in fecal samples as viral RNA; (iii) is transmitted predominantly by horizontal routes; (iv) is prone to superinfection and recombination; (v) has co-evolved with its natural host; and (vi) represents a sensitive marker of population structure that may be useful for chimpanzee taxonomy and conservation strategies."

Although recommendations to modify diet and exercise remain a first-line approach to the management of HIV-infected patients with dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance, it is important to determine to what extent, if any, these metabolic abnormalities may be attributed to or modified by dietary behaviors. I review previous work evaluating dietary behaviors and their relationship to lipid levels and insulin resistance in HIV-infected patients with and without lipodystrophy and discuss the implications of possible dietary interventions and results of preliminary studies of the effects of diet on dyslipidemia. Sound dietary guidelines based on investigational research among HIV-infected patients are clearly needed to help face the challenges of the emerging problems of hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and the possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with HIV infection and lipodystrophy."
5232,0.002,2.0,"India has approximately 5.2 million persons infected with HIV. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being widely introduced in public clinics, many HIV-infected persons still seek care via the private sector. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2004 at six public and private sites to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of ART among patients with HIV receiving care in India. Of 1667 persons surveyed, 609 (36%) had heard of ART and 19% of these persons reported that ART could cure HIV. Twenty-four percent reported that they were currently taking ART, with 18% of these patients not actually on ART according to their provider. Major barriers to taking ART were cost (33%), lack of knowledge of ART (41%), and deferral by physician (30%). More than half of all public and private patients had not heard of CD4 (57%) or viral load testing (80%), and even fewer had received these tests (32% and 11%, respectively). Private clinic attendees were almost 4 times more likely to be on ART (35% versus 9%, p < 0.0001), more likely to be male, have a higher education, be partnered, have a higher income, and have had a CD4 or viral load (p < 0.0001). Overall, low levels of ART knowledge and access were observed among HIV infected patients, with access to ART being particularly low among patients attending public clinics. In order to make widespread dissemination of ART effective in India, further educational and programmatic efforts are likely needed to optimize access, treatment awareness, and compliance among patients with HIV."
5025,0.002,2.0,"Exenatide is an incretin mimetic indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, metformin, or metformin plus a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione. Exenatide lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety. Therapy with exenatide often results in weight loss, which further assists in decreasing insulin resistance. This feature makes the drug an attractive therapeutic option for obese patients. We report the successful off-label use of exenatide in an obese, 40-year-old man with type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who had gastrointestinal intolerance to pramlintide. The patient had experienced a dramatic weight gain secondary to his antiretroviral drugs. This weight gain led to insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes; thus he had characteristics of both types 1 and 2 diabetes, or double diabetes. Before the start of exenatide therapy, he weighed 123 kg, had a body mass index of 42.3 kg/m(2), and had a suboptimal hemoglobin A(1c) value of 8.7%. After 11 months of therapy, the patient lost 24 kg (19.5% of his body weight) and achieved a hemoglobin A(1c) value of 7.3%. His basal insulin requirement was reduced by 25%, and his use of short-acting insulin before breakfast and before dinner was discontinued. In addition, the patient's quality of life substantially improved, as he was able to return to work and exercise after being nearly incapacitated by his weight. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of the use of exenatide in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus or human immunodeficiency virus infection. Given this experience, exenatide may prove to be a useful alternative in selected patients with type 1 diabetes."
6165,0.002,2.0,"We examined the longitudinal association between alcohol use and liver fibrosis, measured by FIB-4 Score, among HIV-infected individuals by (1) antiretroviral therapy (ART) class, and (2) the presence of hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection. This was a prospective cohort study of 550 individuals in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort initiating ART between 2000 and 2012. The relationship between alcohol consumption (defined using NIAAA categories of non-, moderate, and hazardous drinkers) and liver fibrosis (FIB-4 score) by ART class was assessed using linear mixed effects models. Additionally, we examined whether the presence of HCV modified and whether viral load mediated the relationship between alcohol use and liver fibrosis. Overall, FIB-4 levels were 15.6% higher in hazardous drinkers compared to moderate drinkers (p = 0.025) after adjusting by age, sex, and race. Hazardous drinkers on PI-based regimens had FIB-4 scores 26.9% higher than moderate drinkers (p = 0.015). However, there was no difference in FIB-4 levels between hazardous drinkers on non-PI-based regimens compared to moderate drinkers (1.83% versus moderate drinkers, p = 0.848). There was no significant difference in FIB-4 between nondrinkers and moderate drinkers, irrespective of ART regimen. These associations were not modified by HCV status or mediated by viral load changes. Individuals with hazardous alcohol consumption and on PI-based regimens had significantly increased liver fibrosis, as measured by the FIB-4. These data suggest that providers should consider level of alcohol consumption when choosing an ART regimen to minimize detrimental effects on the liver."
4521,0.002,2.0,"T-cell host immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been suggested to play an important role in determining HCV infection outcome. However, data from human studies are not available. This study examined the effect of primary T-cell deficiency along with other factors on the spontaneous clearance of HCV in a large population-based cohort in British Columbia, Canada. The BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort includes all individuals tested for HCV in BC in 1990-2013 linked with data on their medical visits, hospitalizations and prescription drugs. HCV-positive individuals with at least one valid HCV PCR test on/after HCV diagnosis (n=46 783) were included in this study. To examine factors associated with the spontaneous clearance of HCV, multivariable logistic regression was fitted on the full sample, and Cox proportional hazards model on the HCV seroconverters. Spontaneous clearance was observed in 25.1% (n=11 737) of those tested for HCV. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of spontaneous clearance of HCV was lower in people with primary T-cell immunodeficiency (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.32-0.94), and higher in females (aOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.54-1.68) and in those coinfected with HBV (aOR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.93-2.77). Similar results were observed in HCV seroconverters except HBV coinfection was not significant. In conclusion, primary T-cell immunodeficiency is associated with a lower spontaneous clearance of HCV while female sex and coinfection with HBV are associated with a higher spontaneous clearance."
5391,0.002,2.0,"The absolute number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was determined by an immunomagnetic technique directly in the blood of 75 healthy controls and 223 HIV-infected individuals. The HIV-seropositive individuals were also classified clinically according to the system recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the CDC classification was correlated with the patients' T cell subset counts. Compared to the control group, the HIV-infected individuals demonstrated an early and sustained increase in the number of CD8+ T cells with median values of CDC groups II, III, and IV C2 twice that observed in the control group. Patients with AIDS had CD8+ T cell counts comparable to those of the control group. The HIV-infected individuals showed a decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells correlating with clinical deterioration of the disease. T cell subset counts significantly distinguished the group of healthy seropositive individuals from those with HIV-related disease, and the group of patients with AIDS from those with other HIV-related opportunistic infections."
3492,0.002,2.0,"HLA antigens, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated antigens and lymphocyte subsets in liver tissue from 35 patients with HBs antigenemia were studied using an immunoperoxidase double staining method and immunoelectron microscopy in order to clarify the immune mechanism of hepatocyte lysis in type B hepatitis. Immune light and electron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies to lymphocyte subsets revealed that infiltrating lymphocytes in the areas of piecemeal necrosis and focal necrosis were predominantly CD8-positive, showing direct contact with hepatocytes. In contrast, CD4(+) cells were infrequently observed in necrotizing inflammatory lesions. HLA-A,B,C antigens were mainly found on hepatocytes in areas of piecemeal necrosis and focal necrosis, in association with CD8(+) lymphocyte infiltration. HLA-DR antigens were demonstrated on a few hepatocytes in the same lesions. In cases of CAH with serum HBeAg positive, HLA-A,B,C, antigens and HBV antigens simultaneously demonstrated on the same hepatocytes. Especially, hepatocytes expressing both HLA-A,B,C antigen and HBsAg on the plasma membrane showed direct contact with CD8(+)lymphocytes. This finding fulfilled the morphological requirements for HBsAg as a target antigen. On the other hand, HBcAg was hardly demonstrated in the liver cell membrane but was demonstrated mainly in the cytoplasm. Compared with the nuclear localization of HBcAg in cases of NSR, cytoplasmic localization of this antigen may be associated with membranous expression of new antigens induced by HBV infection."
340,0.002,2.0,"With the increasing prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the possibility of a transmission of HIV via allogenic transplants has increased. To assess the risk of transferring HIV with allogenic cartilage grafts we investigated the susceptibility of chondrocytes to the virus. Our results indicate the absence of the HIV receptor (CD-4-molecule) on chondrocytes by immunohistochemistry and FACS analyses. Furthermore cultures from chondrocytes and high doses of HIV-1 did not show an active replication. Hence, we conclude that normal cartilage cells cannot be infected by HIV. This means that the risk of HIV transmission by cartilage allografts is very low if no contaminating tissues like blood, perichondrium and calcifications etc. are present."
5781,0.002,2.0,"This paper examines utilization of paid and unpaid home health care using data from a nationally representative sample of HIV-positive persons receiving medical care in early 1996 (N = 2,864). Overall, 21.0% used any home care, 12.2% used paid care and 13.6% used unpaid care. Most (70.0%) users of home care received care from only one type of provider. Substantially more hours of unpaid than paid care were used. We also found evidence of a strong association between type of service used and type of care provider: 62.4% of persons who used nursing services only received paid care only; conversely, 55.5% of persons who used personal care services only received care only from unpaid caregivers. Use of home care overall was concentrated among persons with AIDS: 39.5% of persons with AIDS received any home health care, compared to 9.5% of those at earlier disease stages. In addition to having an AIDS diagnosis, logistic regression analyses indicated that other need variables significantly increased utilization; a higher number of HIV-related symptoms, lower physical functioning, less energy, a diagnosis of CMV and a recent hospitalization each independently increased the odds of overall home care utilization. Sociodemographic variables had generally weak relationships with overall home care utilization. Among users of home care, non-need variables had more influence on use of paid than unpaid care. Both paid and unpaid home health care is a key component of community-based systems of care for people with HIV infection. The results presented in this paper are the first nationally representative estimates of home care utilization by persons with HIV/AIDS and are discussed with reference to policy and future research."

7712,0.002,2.0,"There is substantial evidence for ongoing replication and evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), even in individuals receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. Viral evolution in the presence of antiviral therapy needs to be considered when developing new therapeutic strategies. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences can be used for this purpose but may give rise to misleading results if rates of intrapatient evolution differ significantly. To improve analyses of HIV-1 evolution relevant to studies of pathogenesis and treatment, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates all available sequence data while simultaneously allowing the phylogenetic parameters of each patient to vary. We used this method to examine evolutionary changes in HIV-1 coreceptor usage in response to treatment. We examined patients whose viral populations exhibited a shift in coreceptor utilization in response to therapy. CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated. By phylogenetically reconstructing the evolutionary relationship of HIV-1 obtained longitudinally from each patient, it was possible to examine the origin of the reemergent R5 virus. Using our Bayesian hierarchical approach, we found that the reemergent R5 virus detectable after therapy was more closely related to the predecessor R5 virus than to the X4 strains. The Bayesian hierarchical approach, unlike more traditional methods, makes it possible to evaluate competing hypotheses across patients. This model is not limited to analyses of HIV-1 but can be used to elucidate evolutionary processes for other organisms as well."

We used 1998-1999 data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance of the Emerging Infections Program Network to compare IPD infections between adults aged 18-64 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and other adults. Of 2346 patients with IPD, 416 (18%) had HIV or AIDS (HIV/AIDS). Certain serotypes (serotypes 6A, 6B, 9N, 9V, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were more common among patients with HIV/AIDS than in adults with no underlying disease (P<.05, vs. serotype 4), even when TMP-SMZ-nonsusceptible isolates were excluded. HIV/AIDS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-2.59), immunocompromising conditions other than HIV/AIDS (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.12-2.18), and black race (aOR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.20-1.88) were independent risk factors for infection with these serotypes.

A cohort of patients initiating ART in a provincial national hospital was set up at the beginning of the program to monitor the impact of treatment on patients. Patients provided information on behaviors through face-to-face interviews. Medical data were obtained from clinical files. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 21-Items Short Form (MOS SF-21). Patients were interviewed when initiating ART and followed up at 3 months, 6 months, and each consecutive 6 months thereafter. From March 2005 through January 2008, the cohort included 549 patients followed for a total of 645 person-years. The 4.0% of patients lost to follow-up were considered dead in the analysis. Incidence of mortality was 9.1 per 100 person-years, which is comparable to international standards. HRQOL subscale scores increased dramatically in the first year after initiating ART. The mean of overall HRQOL score rose from 63.0 at baseline to 81.1 at 1 year and 89.9 at 30 months of follow-up (chi(2) for trends p < 0.001). Simultaneously, the proportion of patients with full-time employment increased from 48.8% to 95.7%.We conclude that the rapid scaling-up of ART delivery in a resource poor Asian setting dramatically improved the survival and well-being of its beneficiaries, who in turn resumed productive lives within their communities."
1780,0.002,2.0,"Viral tropism plays an important role in HIV pathogenesis. However, its correlation with the clinical outcome and following exposure to antiretroviral drugs are still unclear. HIV-1 co-receptor usage was examined in 206 infected individuals: 67 seroconverters, 52 chronically drug-naïve, and 87 antiretroviral-experienced patients. The V3 loop was sequenced from plasma HIV-RNA and co-receptor usage was inferred using a phenotype predictor software (http://genomiac2.ucsd.edu:8080/wetcat/v3.html), which classifies V3 sequences as R5 or X4. The overall prevalence of X4 viruses was 26.2%, with significant differences among groups: 13.4% in seroconverters, 25% in drug-naïve, and 36.8% in antiretroviral- experienced patients (P = 0.001). The presence of X4 variants in the latter group was associated with higher viral load (P = 0.002) but not with lower CD4 counts. There was no association between HIV tropism and gender, transmission route or age. Neither with the CCR5 Delta32 genotype. Moreover, no association was found between HIV-1 tropism and drug resistance mutations nor with failure to regimens based on either protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Finally, no significant association was found between IL-7 plasma levels with HIV-1 tropism. In summary, X4 viruses are particularly frequent among antiretroviral-experienced patients with high viral loads, irrespective of the CD4 count. Thus, CCR5 antagonists should be used with special caution in this subset of patients."

559,0.002,2.0,"Aerolysin is a channel-forming toxin secreted by Aeromonas spp. that binds to glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as Thy-1, on sensitive target cells. Receptor binding is followed first by oligomerization of the toxin and then by insertion of the oligomers into the membrane to form stable channels that disrupt the permeability barrier. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) produced from T cells is known to incorporate Thy-1 and other GPI-anchored proteins into its membrane. Here, we show that aerolysin is capable of neutralizing HIV-1 in a dose-dependent manner and that neutralization depends upon the presence of these proteins in the viral envelope. Pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to remove GPI-anchored proteins greatly reduced HIV-1 sensitivity to the toxin, and virus originating from a mutant cell line that lacks GPI-anchored proteins was not neutralized. Aerolysin variants with single amino acid changes that prevent oligomerization or insertion of the toxin were unable to inactivate the virus, implying that channel formation is necessary for neutralization to occur. These findings represent the first evidence that a pathogenic human virus can be neutralized by a bacterial toxin."

Several studies have reported the occurrence of PBL in HIV-negative patients, but comparative data are lacking. The goal of this study was to compare the characteristics of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL. A MEDLINE search was undertaken through August 2009 for cases of PBL in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Cases were identified and clinicopathological data were gathered. χ(2) was used to compare categorical and t-test to compare continuous variables between groups. Calculated Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were compared using the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used for multivariate analysis. From 228 identified cases of PBL, 157 were HIV-positive and 71 HIV-negative. HIV-positive patients were younger, and more likely to be men, present with oral involvement, respond to chemotherapy, and express CD20, CD56, and EBV-encoded RNA than HIV-negative patients. In univariate analysis, age ≥60, advanced stage, bone marrow involvement, no chemotherapy, Ki-67 expression >80%, and HIV-negative status were associated with worse overall survival. In multivariate analysis, advanced stage and no chemotherapy were independent adverse prognostic factors. In conclusion, HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with PBL have different clinicopathological characteristics, including a better response to chemotherapy and longer survival in HIV-positive patients."
465,0.002,2.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein gp41 mediates viral fusion with human host cells. The peptide segment T20/DP178, located in the C-terminus of the ectodomain of gp41, interacts with the N-terminal leucine zipper-like domain on gp41 to establish the fusogenic conformation of the virus. Synthetic T20/DP178 peptide is highly efficacious in inhibiting HIV-1 infection in vitro by disrupting the transformation of fusogenic status of viral gp41; thus, it has been proposed for clinical trial. We report that synthetic T20/DP178 is a chemoattractant and activator of human peripheral blood phagocytes but not of T lymphocytes. We further demonstrate that T20/DP178 specifically activates a seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled phagocyte receptor for N-formylated chemotactic peptides, formyl peptide receptor (FPR). Moreover, synthetic T20/DP178 analogs lacking N-terminal amino acids acted as FPR antagonists. Our results suggest that gp41 peptides regulate phagocyte function via FPR and identify a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 may modulate innate immunity."

In contrast, cytoplasmic HBcAg expression was significantly greater in patients with CPH and CAH (P < .0108). In addition, cytoplasmic HBcAg correlated significantly with lobular activity, portal inflammation, and hepatitic activity (P < or = .007). Expression of cytoplasmic HBcAg also exceeded cytoplasmic HBeAg and nuclear HBcAg in liver specimens showing significant damage (P < .038). HBsAg, however, showed no secular trend and was not related to liver histology. The authors' findings support the theory that HBcAg is also the viral target antigen for immune-mediated liver damage in Chinese patients with chronic HBV infection."
8020,0.001,1.0,"CD4+ central memory T cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of simian immunodeficiency virus disease, and the CCR5 density on the surface of CD4 T cells is an important factor in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 disease progression. We hypothesized that quantifying central memory cells and CCR5 expression in the early stages of HIV-infection could provide useful prognostic information. We enrolled two different groups of acute HIV-infected subjects. One group progressed to CD4 T cell numbers below 250 cells/µl within 2 years (CD4 Low group), while the other group maintained CD4 cell counts above 450 cells/µl over 2 years (CD4 High group). We compared the CCR5 levels and percentage of CD4 subsets between the two groups during the 1st year of HIV infection. We found no differences between the two groups regarding the percentage of naïve, central memory and effector memory subsets of CD4 cells during the 1st year of HIV-1 infection. CCR5 levels on CD4+ CM subset was higher in the CD4 Low group compared with the CD4 High group during the 1st year of HIV-1 infection. High CCR5 levels on CD4 central memory cells in acute HIV infection are mostly associated with rapid disease progression. Our data suggest that low CCR5 expression on CD4 central memory cells protects CD4 cells from direct virus infection and favors the preservation of CD4(+) T cell homeostasis."

A total of 2,647 centers, representing 224,954 patients and 54,194 staff members, responded. Seventy-seven percent of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers. At the end of 1995, 65% of patients were treated with an arteriovenous graft, 22% an arteriovenous fistula, and 13% a temporary or permanent central catheter. By the end of 1995, at least three doses of hepatitis B vaccine had been administered to 35% of patients and to 82% of staff members. Acute infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) occurred in 0.06% of patients, and was more likely to be reported by centers with lower proportions of patients vaccinated against HBV. The prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) was 10.4% among patients and 2.0% among staff. At least one patient with vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) was reported by 11.5% of centers, more commonly by hospital (vs freestanding centers not located in hospitals) and government centers, and centers located in certain geographic areas. Vancomycin was received by 7.2% of patients in December 1995. The percentage of centers reporting patients with other pathogens was 7.9% for active tuberculosis, 39% for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 40% for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."

746,0.001,1.0,"The authors conducted a preliminary study of the 4-session Holistic Health for HIV (3H+), which was adapted from a 12-session evidence-based risk reduction and antiretroviral adherence intervention. Improvements were found in the behavioral skills required to properly adhere to HIV medication regimens. Enhancements were found in all measured aspects of sex-risk reduction outcomes, including HIV knowledge, motivation to reduce sex-risk behavior, behavioral skills related to engaging in reduced sexual risk, and reduced risk behavior. Improvements in drug use outcomes included enhancements in risk reduction skills as well as reduced heroin and cocaine use. Intervention effects also showed durability from post-intervention to the follow-up assessment point. Females responded particularly well in terms of improvements in risk reduction skills and risk behavior. This study suggests that an evidence-based behavioral intervention may be successfully adapted for use in community-based clinical settings where HIV-infected drug users can be more efficiently reached."
4009,0.001,1.0,"The mechanisms underlying chronicity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are poorly understood, but the importance of impaired viral clearance by the immune system has been suggested. The prevalence of HCV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was in investigated in 34 persistently infected patients with anti-HCV (7 with liver cirrhosis, 10 with chronic active hepatitis, 5 with chronic persistent hepatitis, 4 with chronic lobular hepatitis, and 8 healthy carriers) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCV infection of 116 T cell clones derived from liver infiltrating mononuclear cells obtained from 3 patients with chronic liver disease was examined using the same methods. HCV genomic sequences were found in fresh, unstimulated PBMC from 20 patients with cirrhosis, and chronic active and persistent hepatitis, but in none of the healthy carriers and only in mitogen-activated cells from 1 out of 4 patients with autoresolving chronic lobular hepatitis. Active PBMC infection was confirmed by identification of anti-genomic HCV sequences in the majority of HCV RNA-positive cells (fresh or mitogen-stimulated). A high percentage of T cell clones obtained from liver infiltrates were found to be infected by HCV. These findings suggest that HCV infection of lymphatic cells plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronically evolving liver damage. PBMC may represent a reservoir for latent infection and a site for viral multiplication."
5652,0.001,1.0,"LAV/HTLV-III has been closely linked to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have studied and correlated the prevalence of AIDS-associated retrovirus and retroviral antibodies in several groups of male homosexuals from Greenwich Village. Retrovirus was detected in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes by testing for reverse transcriptase (RT) and confirmed by establishment of virus-producer cell lines, and electron microscopy. Seventy-six percent of patients with AIDS, 93% with AIDS-related complex (ARC), 69% with generalized lymphadenopathy (LAS), and 35% of asymptomatic homosexuals were positive for virus in the RT assay. Transmission of the virus from RT-positive lymphocytes into the CEM cell line was successful in 10 of 11 randomly chosen cases. No virus isolates were obtained from lymphocytes of 8 heterosexual individuals. Serum antibodies against AIDS-associated virus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay and confirmed by Western blotting, using an LAV/HTLV-III-producer cell line, LAV-N1, which we established. LAV/N1 virus was purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradient and the pattern of its proteins was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using sera from an AIDS patient. The major polypeptides of LAV/HTLV-III (19, 25-27, 32, 42 and 54 kilodalton) were present. These proteins did not react in Western blots with sera positive for Adult T cell leukemia virus (ATLV). thus, LAV-N1 and ATLV were not antigenically related. In our assay for LAV/HTLV-III antibodies, 18 (100%) of patients with AIDS, 13 (100%) of patients with ARC, 24 (69%) of 35 patients with LAS and 9 (39%) of 23 asymptomatic homosexuals were sero-positive. Heterosexual controls were negative. All IF-positive sera tested by Western blot contained antibodies against specific viral proteins. High titers (greater than or equal to 1:1280) of serum antibodies against LAV/HTLV-III virus were detected in 71% of AIDS patients, 62% with ARC, 38% LAS and 13% among asymptomatic homosexuals. Our data show that the presence of LAV/HTLV-III antibodies correlates with the presence of infectious virus. Antibody titers may also correlate with progression toward AIDS."
7747,0.001,1.0,"An evolving dominance of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 subtype C (HIV-1C) in the AIDS epidemic has been associated with a high prevalence of HIV-1C infection in the southern African countries and with an expanding epidemic in India and China. Understanding the molecular phylogeny and genetic diversity of HIV-1C viruses may be important for the design and evaluation of an HIV vaccine for ultimate use in the developing world. In this study we analyzed the phylogenetic relationships (i) between 73 non-recombinant HIV-1C near-full-length genome sequences, including 51 isolates from Botswana; (ii) between HIV-1C consensus sequences that represent different geographic subsets; and (iii) between specific isolates and consensus sequences. Based on the phylogenetic analyses of 73 near-full-length genomes, 16 ""lineages"" (a term that is used hereafter for discussion purposes and does not imply taxonomic standing) were identified within HIV-1C. The lineages were supported by high bootstrap values in maximum-parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses and were confirmed by the maximum-likelihood method. The nucleotide diversity between the 73 HIV-1C isolates (mean value of 8.93%; range, 2.9 to 11.7%) was significantly higher than the diversity of the samples to the consensus sequence (mean value of 4.86%; range, 3.3 to 7.2%, P < 0.0001). The translated amino acid distances to the consensus sequence were significantly lower than distances between samples within all HIV-1C proteins. The consensus sequences of HIV-1C proteins accompanied by amino acid frequencies were presented (that of Gag is presented in this work; those of Pol, Vif, Vpr, Tat, Rev, Vpu, Env, and Nef are presented elsewhere [http://www.aids.harvard.edu/lab_research/concensus_sequence.htm]). Additionally, in the promoter region three NF-kappa B sites (GGGRNNYYCC) were identified within the consensus sequences of the entire set or any subset of HIV-1C isolates. This study suggests that the consensus sequence approach could overcome the high genetic diversity of HIV-1C and facilitate an AIDS vaccine design, particularly if the assumption that an HIV-1C antigen with a more extensive match to the circulating viruses is likely to be more efficacious is proven in efficacy trials."

692,0.001,1.0,"Given the continued high incidence of HIV infection in the United States among racial/ethnic minority young men who have sex with men (YMSM), and an appreciation that antiretroviral therapy (ART) can provide personal and public health benefits, attention is needed to enhance the detection of HIV-infected youth and engage them in medical care and support services that encourage sustained HIV treatment and suppression of viremia. Poor retention in clinical care has been associated with higher mortality, an increase in HIV RNA, and decreased CD4 cell count. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the health care utilization and health outcomes of HIV-infected racial/ethnic minority YMSM enrolled in an outreach, linkage, and retention study funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB). We hypothesized that among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, baseline CD4 counts and usage of ART are influenced by age, race, drug and alcohol use, and mental health symptoms. Overall, 155 subjects had at least a baseline CD4 count recorded at study entry. There was a low rate of ART use in this population with only one-half of the cohort with CD4 counts ≤ 350 cells/mm(3) being prescribed ART to treat their infection. However, of those youth who were started on ART, the majority (74%) did achieve undetectable viral loads (< 400 copies). Given the continued increase in cases of HIV infection among racial/ethnic minority YMSM, efforts to increase both the provision of ART and support services that encourage adherence in this population are warranted."

Between June 2000 and September 2002, 1,480 participants (1,183 HIV-infected persons and 297 controls) were enrolled in FRAM. Measurements taken included whole-body magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of regional fat, anthropometric measurements, central laboratory analysis of metabolites, and assessment of symptoms, sociodemographic factors, and lifestyle. Similar measurements were repeated among FRAM participants 4 years later (FRAM 2) for investigation of the progression of fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. In FRAM 2, which is ongoing, investigators are also determining the associations of subclinical cardiovascular disease, as measured by carotid intimal-medial wall thickness, with HIV infection, fat distribution changes, insulin resistance, and other proatherogenic changes in serum lipid levels. The demographic characteristics of HIV-infected FRAM men and women were comparable to those reported from a national random sampling of HIV-infected men and women receiving medical care in the United States. The representativeness of the FRAM sample increases its value as a resource for studies on fat distribution, metabolic changes, and atherosclerosis in HIV infection."
4932,0.001,1.0,"The objective was to determine the current use of their general practitioner (GP) by patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and whether such patients would be interested in having 'shared care' between a specialist HIV clinic and their GP. A questionnaire was administered to 203 HIV-positive men attending the HIV outpatient clinic of a central London teaching hospital. The main outcome measures were patient characteristics, numbers of patients registered with a GP, numbers of patients with a GP aware of their diagnosis, contacts with the GP in the last year and level of interest and shared care. Eighty-five per cent of patients were registered with a GP of whom 67% knew of the diagnosis. Those diagnosed for more than 2 years were significantly more likely to have an informed GP. A total of 73% of those registered had visited their GP in the previous year although only 27% had visited for an HIV-related problem. Only 19% had a GP actively involved in their HIV care. In all 51% of the patients indicated an interest in having shared care between the clinic and their GP. A high proportion of HIV patients are registered with and attend a GP although they rarely consult for HIV-related problems. A significant proportion of patients expressed interest in having shared care suggesting that there is the potential for increased GP involvement in the care of patients with HIV infection."

HIV-1-seropositive donors at 20 blood centers were studied for information to be used in evaluating the safety of the US blood supply and making recommendations to increase that safety. From June 1988 to August 1989, 829 (0.04%) of 2,192,000 donors were found to be seropositive; 512 were interviewed. Of 388 seropositive men, 56 percent had had sex with men, 10 percent had used drugs intravenously, 8 percent had had sex with intravenous drug users, and 27 percent had no identified risk. Of 124 seropositive women, 58 percent had had sex with men at risk for HIV (81% of whom used drugs intravenously), 5 percent had used drugs intravenously, and 41 percent had no identified risk. Racial and ethnic minorities made up 68 percent of seropositive donors (black, 38%; Hispanic, 30%) and approximately 14 percent of all donors. The 157 persons with no identified risk had demographic characteristics and serologic test results for syphilis and hepatitis B that were more similar to those of HIV-1-seropositive donors with recognized risk than to those of seronegative donors.

7631,0.001,1.0,"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents one of the strongest predictors of progression to AIDS, yet it is difficult for most patients to sustain high levels of adherence. This study compares the efficacy of a personalized cell phone reminder system (ARemind) in enhancing adherence to ART versus a beeper. Twenty-three HIV-infected subjects on ART with self-reported adherence less than 85% were randomized to a cellular phone (CP) or beeper (BP). CP subjects received personalized text messages daily; in contrast, BP subjects received a reminder beep at the time of dosing. Interviews were scheduled at weeks 3 and 6. Adherence to ART was measured by self-report (SR, 7-day recall), pill count (PC, past 30 days at baseline, then past 3 weeks), Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; cumulatively at 3 and 6 weeks), and via a composite adherence score constructed by combining MEMS, pill count, and self report. A mixed effects model adjusting for baseline adherence was used to compare adherence rates between the intervention groups at 3 and 6 weeks. Nineteen subjects completed all visits, 10 men and 9 females. The mean age was 42.7 ± 6.5 years, 37% of subjects were Caucasian and 89% acquired HIV heterosexually. The average adherence to ART was 79% by SR and 65% by PC at baseline in both arms; over 6 weeks adherence increased and remained significantly higher in the ARemind group using multiple measures of adherence. A larger and longer prospective study is needed to confirm these findings and to better understand optimal reminder messages and user fatigue."

5905,0.001,1.0,"The identification of HIV-1 coreceptors has provided a molecular basis for the tropism of different HIV-1 strains. CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) mediates the entry of both primary and T cell line-adapted (TCLA) syncytia-inducing strains. Although macrophages (M phi) express CXCR4, this coreceptor is assumed to be nonfunctional for HIV-1 infection. We addressed this apparent paradox by infecting human monocyte-derived M phi with primary and TCLA isolates that were rigorously characterized for coreceptor usage and by adding the natural CXCR4 ligand, stem cell differentiation factor-1, to specifically block CXCR4-mediated entry. Our results show that primary HIV-1 isolates that selectively use CXCR4 productively infected both normal and C-C chemokine receptor-5-null M phi. By contrast, M phi supported the entry of CXCR4-dependent TCLA strains with variable efficiency but were not productively infected. Thus, the tropism of HIV isolates results from complex virus/host cell interactions both at the entry and postentry levels."
7323,0.001,1.0,"Over a period of 3 months a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected patient showed a sequence of positive-negative-positive anti-HIV screening test results. During this period the level of HIV p24 antigen declined and the HIV antibody pattern by Western blot gradually became complete, suggesting recent HIV infection. However the patient's weight loss, esophageal candidiasis, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, together with the severely and persistently lowered CD4 cell counts and the absence of an IgM anti-HIV response, suggest late-stage HIV infection. Despite additional and follow-up testing, it was impossible to determine whether the patient suffered from acute, primary HIV infection with severe immunodepression or from advanced HIV infection (AIDS) with hampered HIV antibody production leading to false-negative test results by the anti-HIV enzyme immunoassay and Western blot. This case illustrates that HIV serology does not always follow the rules. The presence of HIV infection should be considered in a patient showing clinical signs of acute or late-stage HIV infection, even if the anti-HIV assay is negative."
7297,0.001,1.0,"A 39-year-old man with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was admitted with right-sided weakness, right-sided vision loss and slurred speech, which worsened over several weeks. Brain imaging revealed bilateral intraparenchymal ring-enhancing lesions and enhancement of the right optic nerve. Serological findings were positive for venereal disease research laboratory test, whereas the cerebrospinal fluid venereal disease research laboratory test was nonreactive. Brain biopsy suggested a diagnosis of syphilitic cerebral gummata, and the patient's improvement with penicillin and dexamethasone further supported this etiology. Syphilitic cerebral gummata have rarely been reported in patients with HIV infection. This patient demonstrates that cerebral gummata should be considered in the differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients with characteristic brain masses, that HIV and syphilis often coexist with early neurosyphilis appearing more frequently in this patient population and that normal cerebrospinal fluid studies may not represent a true lack of syphilitic activity in HIV patients."
5363,0.001,1.0,"There is increasing evidence that CD8 lymphocytes may represent targets for infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo whose destruction may contribute to the loss of immune function underlying AIDS. HIV-1 may infect thymic precursor cells destined to become CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and contribute to the numerical decline in both subsets on disease progression. There is also evidence for the induction of CD4 expression and susceptibility to infection by HIV-1 of CD8 lymphocytes activated in vitro. To investigate the relationship between CD8 activation and infection by HIV-1 in vivo, activated subsets of CD8 lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-seropositive individuals were investigated for CD4 expression and HIV infection. Activated CD8 lymphocytes were identified by expression of CD69, CD71, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, the beta-chain of CD8, and the RO isoform of CD45. CD4(+) and CD4(-) CD8 lymphocytes, CD4 lymphocytes, other T cells, and non-T cells were purified using paramagnetic beads, and proviral sequences were quantified by PCR using primers from the long terminal repeat region. Frequencies of activated CD8 lymphocytes were higher in HIV-infected study subjects than in seronegative controls, and they frequently coexpressed CD4 (mean frequencies on CD69(+), CD71(+), and HLA class II(+) cells of 23, 37, and 8%, respectively, compared with 1 to 2% for nonactivated CD8 lymphocytes). The level of CD4 expression of the double-positive population approached that of mature CD4 lymphocytes. That CD4 expression renders CD8 cell susceptible to infection was indicated by their high frequency of infection in vivo; infected CD4(+) CD8 lymphocytes accounted for between 3 and 72% of the total proviral load in PBMCs from five of the eight study subjects investigated, despite these cells representing a small component of the PBMC population (<3%). Combined, these findings provide evidence that antigenic stimulation of CD8 lymphocytes in vivo induces CD4 expression that renders them susceptible to HIV infection and destruction. The specific targeting of responding CD8 lymphocytes may provide a functional explanation for the previously observed impairment of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) function disproportionate to their numerical decline in AIDS and for the deletion of specific clones of CTLs responding to HIV antigens."

9202,0.001,1.0,"Among the various mechanisms proposed to explain the pathogenesis of cerebral lesions in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced encephalitis, a cytokine-mediated action has found most favour. Indeed, elevated expression of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), thought to be neurotoxic, has been found in AIDS patients. As a previous study had demonstrated the presence of HIV proviral DNA in brain tissue of a number of HIV-positive non-AIDS patients, we undertook this present investigation using morphological, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, the presence of HIV-1 proviral DNA and of the cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha, IL-4 and IL-6 in brains of the same group of individuals. The study included brains of 36 asymptomatic HIV-1 positive patients and the results were compared with those of AIDS patients either affected by HIV encephalitis (n = 8) or exempt from any neuropathological changes (n = 10) as well as of normal controls (n = 5). Results show that: HIV proviral DNA could be detected by PCR in 17 out of the 36 brains from HIV-positive pre-AIDS cases; most (15 of 17) of PCR-positive brains showed minimal to severe expression of MHC class II antigen; and cytokines could be detected predominantly within white matter even at this early stage. The data demonstrated that the state of immune activation described in AIDS is already present at the pre-AIDS stage and suggest that the presence of cytokines may already trigger the cascade of events leading to brain damage."
3961,0.001,1.0,"Recent studies suggest human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be the cause of HIV-associated idiopathic esophageal ulcer (IEU). However, other causes of esophageal disease in HIV-infected patients have not been evaluated for appropriate comparison. Over a 14-month period 13 patients with IEU as determined by clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic criteria were identified. During the same period nine HIV-infected patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis and one HIV-infected patient each with herpes simplex virus esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were also identified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ DNA hybridization (ISH) were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue formed on paraffin-embedded tissue of endoscopic biopsies of ulcer tissue using standard techniques. Eleven of 13 IEU patients (85%) as compared to seven of nine patients (78%) with CMV had HIV detected by PCR (P = 0.38). HIV was also detected in ulcer tissue from biopsy material from the patient with GERD but not herpes simplex virus esophagitis. In PCR-positive patients, ISH confirmed the presence of HIV in four patients (57%) with CMV and eight (73%) with IEU (p = 0.31). HIV was found only in inflammatory cells and not squamous epithelial cells. Given the similar prevalence of detection of HIV by PCR and ISH in ulcer tissue from both groups of HIV-infected patients as well as the location in rare inflammatory cells, we conclude that HIV infection of squamous mucosa does not appear to be the primary cause of IEU."

Symptoms of acute HIV infection are nonspecific (e.g., fever, malaise, myalgias, rash), making misdiagnosis common. Because a wide range of conditions may produce similar symptoms, the diagnosis of acute HIV infection involves a high index of suspicion, a thorough assessment of HIV exposure risk, and appropriate HIV-related laboratory tests. HIV RNA viral load testing is the most useful diagnostic test for acute HIV infection because HIV antibody testing results are generally negative or indeterminate during acute HIV infection. After the diagnosis of acute HIV infection is confirmed, physicians should discuss effective transmission risk reduction strategies with patients. The decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy should be guided by consultation with an HIV specialist."

The absence of an external cocarcinogenic effect in the well-monitored woodchucks indicates the carcinogenicity of WHV and suggests the same for the genetically and biologically similar human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Laboratory infections of woodchucks with two strains of WHV, not reported here in detail, resembled human and chimpanzee HBV infections histologically and serologically. In these studies, eight woodchucks became carriers of surface antigen of WHV for greater than 1 year. All eight woodchucks developed HCC, indicating a 100% risk of HCC in experimentally infected chronic WHV antigen carriers, which is analogous to the high risk of HCC in human hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. Histologically, the absence of cirrhosis in the examined pericarcinomatous tissue permits recognition of gradual transition from normal parenchyma to neoplastic nodules to HCC of rising anaplasia, indicating a continuum of increasingly more malignant neoplastic stages, as known for chemical carcinogenesis. The HCC developed in carrier woodchucks infected as newborns with only minor, if any, hepatitic changes but is associated with antigen-carrying hepatocytes and sometimes with hyperplastic nodules. This stage was preceded in infected adults by an early, acute, weeks-long hepatitis coinciding with the appearance of surface antigen. These findings are also analogous to typical HBV infection in human newborns and young adults, respectively. At the time of HCC development in all animals with adequate histologic material, an acute recent necroinflammation appeared around the tumor, associated with abnormal hematopoietic cells around and within the tumor. A promoting role in carcinogenesis of this necroinflammation of yet unestablished pathogenesis is being postulated, to be confirmed by determination of the status of the WHV DNA in the HCC and by prospective histologic study of the inflammatory reaction."
7131,0.001,1.0,"Hepatitis is a feature of many viral diseases usually resulting as a part of generalised infection which involves the liver. In contrast, there are at least five different hepatitis viruses (HAV to HEV) that primarily target the liver in humans--called hepatitis viruses, whereas the role of sixth virus (HGV) is doubtful. Although symptoms produced are similar, these viruses differ greatly in their structure, mode of replication and transmission. The aim of this article is to bring out salient features of these viruses and approach towards their control/prevention, laying emphasis on HBV which has attained/ become one of major public health problems in India."
9226,0.001,1.0,"A heterosexual partner study was carried out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from August 1990 to December 1991. The main objectives were to determine the rate of male-to-female transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and to determine risk factors. Male index cases were recruited according to the following criteria: 1) confirmed HIV positivity, 2) 18 years old or older; 3) heterosexual contact within the past year. Only female partners who reported not to have other risk factors but to have had sexual contact with the index case were invited to participate. Couples were interviewed for risk factors and had blood collected for laboratory studies. The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 45 percent among 204 female partners in the study. Using logistic regression, the authors found the following factors to be independently (p < 0.05) associated with HIV infection: 1) anal sex (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-7.45); 2) condom use during vaginal sex sometimes (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96), rarely (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.15-3.83), or never (OR = 3.04, 95% CI 1.23-7.50) as compared with always; 3) frequency of sexual contacts in the year prior to interview (100+) (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.03-3.91); and 4) oral contraceptive use (OR = 2.04, 95% CI 0.97-4.29). In addition to a borderline significance of oral contraceptive use, there was a strong suggestion of an interaction with history of sexually transmitted diseases."
1261,0.001,1.0,"GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV), a recently discovered orphan flavivirus, is distantly related to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although both GBV-C/HGV and HCV can be transmitted by the parenteral route, their principal modes of transmission and associated risk behaviors may differ. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, the 5'-noncoding regions of GBV-C/HGV and HCV were amplified from plasma or sera of 209 individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). As verified by Southern blot analysis, GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection were detected in 37 (17.7%) and 22 (10.5%) of 209 HIV-1-infected individuals, respectively. GBV-C/HGV infection was significantly associated with homosexual sex (P = 0.044) and was more common than HCV infection among HIV-1-infected homosexual men (P = 0.006). The prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection was nearly equal in women infected with HIV-1 via high-risk heterosexual sex (14.0%) or injection drug use (IDU) (17.5%). By contrast, HCV infection was associated significantly with women reporting IDU when compared to women reporting high-risk heterosexual sex (P < 0.0001). Alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated in HIV-1-infected individuals who were co-infected with HCV (P = 0.009), but not with GBV-C/HGV (P = 0.9). The high prevalence of GBV-C/HGV infection in HIV-1-infected nondrug-injecting homosexual men and among women engaging in high-risk heterosexual sex is consistent with transmission by the mucosal route and with acquisition of infection by the receptive rather than insertive partner."
1651,0.001,1.0,"The seroprevalence and risk factors for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were determined among 1,497 heterosexuals with no history of intravenous drug use (median age 32, range 15-78) treated at a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Rome. A total of 329 (22.0%) had antibodies to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), a rate nearly four times as high as the 5.8% found recently in a national sample of young male adults, ages 18-26 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of anti-HBc positivity was independently associated with male sex, increasing age, lower level of education, three or more sexual partners in the previous year, and positive syphilis serology. Lack of condom use, history of nonulcerative sexually transmitted diseases, and genital herpes were not associated with anti-HBc positivity. These findings confirm that heterosexual exposure plays an important role in the spread of HBV infection. Furthermore, these data indicate that individuals with more than two sexual partners a year and those with positive syphilis serology should be immunised against HBV."
1703,0.001,1.0,"To explore the introduction of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into intravenous drug abusing populations, risk behaviors of 1,154 intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) in four U.S. cities with low prevalence of IVDA/HIV infection (0.9-13.0%) were examined. Seropositive subjects (N = 54) were compared with demographically matched seronegative controls regarding drug use practices, homosexual contact, blood transfusions, risk behaviors while traveling or living in high prevalence areas, and acquaintance with persons with AIDS. With the exception of needle sharing with homosexual/bisexual males, no differences in risk behaviors were found between seropositive subjects and matched seronegatives. Seropositives were substantially more likely than matched seronegatives to report having shared a needle with a homosexual or bisexual male, suggesting that needle sharing between homosexual/bisexual IVDAs and heterosexual IVDAs may be an important means by which HIV is introduced among heterosexual IVDAs in low prevalence areas."
6125,0.001,1.0,"Increased coronary heart disease risk in HIV-positive patients using antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been a controversial topic since 1998 when the dyslipidaemic effect of protease inhibitors (PIs) was recognised. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between ART and increased coronary heart disease risk. In 2003, the large, prospective D:A:D (Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs) study reported a 26% relative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first 4-6 years of use. As the HIV-population grows older, infectious disease specialists have to consider unfamiliar areas of internal medicine such as lipid-lowering therapy and smoking cessation. Moreover, the ART regimen itself may be a modifiable risk factor, as there are both class differences and within-class differences in the tendency to increase lipids. Most nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), including the newer agents tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine, have little or no effect on lipid levels or glucose metabolism. One exception is the highly effective NRTI stavudine, which has a dyslipidaemic profile and a negative effect on glucose metabolism. In contrast the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nevirapine may increase the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and thus reduce the total cholesterol : HDL cholesterol index. Most of the PIs have some dyslipidaemic effect, especially ritonavir (alone or in combination with other PIs), fosamprenavir and the novel PI tipranavir. Only atazanavir, and to some extent saquinavir, seem to have little effect on lipid levels and glucose metabolism. Studies on blood pressure in HIV-positive patients have been contradictory. Apart from a recent report from the D:A:D study where lower blood pressure was found in patients receiving NNRTIs, the influence of the individual drugs on blood pressure is unknown. When hypertension is detected in a HIV-positive patient, creatinine clearance (CL(CR)) should be calculated and the urine checked for proteinuria. When CL(CR) is <30 mL/min, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended. Many hypertensive HIV-positive patients have proteinuria and an ACE inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is a better choice than a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel antagonist in these patients. In addition, physicians treating patients with ART should be especially aware of the long list of possible interactions between PIs and anti-hypertensive- and lipid-lowering drugs. This review discusses important clinical aspects of treating middle-aged HIV-positive patients who have an increased risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event."
4043,0.001,1.0,"The ""natural killer"" (NK) cells preferentially kill targets lacking surface major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule expression. NK cells recognize these targets through membrane receptors, which can trigger activating or inhibitory signals for killing. Several tumors or virus-infected cells downregulate MHC-I expression as a mechanism to evade recognition and killing by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). They, however, become targets for NK cells cytotoxic activity. NK cell activity is reduced during disease progression in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and in individuals with AIDS-associated tumors linked with infection by the oncogenic human herpes virus type-8 (HHV8), including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). We have demonstrated that AIDS-related KS (AIDS-KS) is characterized by an increased expression of inhibitory receptors by T lymphocytes, and that HIV-non-infected patients with KS (classic KS, C-KS) have a substantial number of NK cells bearing these same receptors. NK cells from patients with C-KS are normally equipped with cytolytic molecules including granzyme A and perforin. However, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is reduced in patients with C-KS, AIDS-KS, or PEL patients, who are all infected by the HHV8, and this correlates with disease severity. Moreover, we have found that HHV8-infected cell lines established from PELs have a reduced surface expression of MHC-I molecules and are sensitive to the lysis mediated by NK cells. Since PEL cells express the same HHV8 latency program as KS cells, these data point to MHC-I downregulation by HHV8 as a primary immune evasion mechanism against CTL responses, further reinforced by upregulation of inhibitory receptors on T and NK cells in the setting of HIV and/or HHV8 infection. Thus, studies on killing receptor regulation and signaling in T and NK cells may shed light on the pathogenesis of HHV8-associated tumors both in HIV-infected or -noninfected patients."
7764,0.001,1.0,"CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells have been shown to maintain peripheral tolerance against self and foreign antigens. In this study we analyzed the effect of circulating CD4+ CD25+ T cells on CD8+-T-cell responses of patients with chronic and resolved hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We demonstrated that circulating CD4+ CD25+ T cells modulate the function and expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ cells ex vivo in all patients, regardless of whether they have chronic or resolved HBV infection. The possible role of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the pathogenesis of chronic HBV infection is not supported by these data. However, these results might have implications for optimizing future immunotherapeutic approaches to HBV treatment."
3014,0.001,1.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health concern worldwide and only a minority of treated patients develop a sustained protective response following a short course of therapy, and most patients require prolonged treatment to suppress viral replication. However, several recent reports showed that inhibition of certain host cell proteins prevented viral infection, specifically the human abhydrolase domain containing 2 (ABHD2) has been confirmed by our previous study to be upregulated in HepG2.2.15 cells but downregulated by lamivudine. These observations suggested that ABHD2 was important for HBV propagation and could be a target of novel anti-HBV drugs. To assess the importance of ABHD2 to the HBV infection process, antisense oligonucleotides (ASODNs) were used to downregulate ABHD2 expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. From 5 ASODNS candidates tested, AB3 significantly downregulated ABHD2 mRNA and protein expression levels. Further, AB3 significantly reduced HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B ""e"" antigen protein expression levels in cell medium without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that downregulation of ABHD2 using ASODNs blocked HBV replication and expression without affecting host cell physiology. Further, data demonstrated an essential role of ABHD2 in HBV propagation, suggesting it can serve as a novel target for anti-HBV drug development."
9849,0.001,1.0,"The case of a young female patient with chronic active hepatitis B, vasculitic purpura, edema, and circulating immune complexes due to mixed cryoglobulinemia is described. Serum transaminases were elevated. Serological assays showed hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) antibodies but no antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) or antibody to hepatitis delta virus (anti-HDV) antibodies. Using hepatitis B virus-polymerase chain reaction (HBV-PCR) and direct sequencing a precore/core (preC/C) mutant unable to synthesize HBeAg was detected in serum. HBV antigens were demonstrated in the circulating immune complexes. Following 1 month of treatment with interferon-alpha 2b3 miu three times weekly, alanine aminotransferases returned to normal levels while cryoglobulins and immune complexes disappeared from serum. In addition, 2 months after the onset of treatment serum HBV-DNA was no longer detectable by PCR. Prior to treatment the analysis of cellular immune reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a major proliferative response to HBcAg, preS1Ag and HBxAg and a minor response to HBeAg and HBsAg. One month after conclusion of treatment a decline in T-cell reactivity against all HBV antigens was observed. During clinical response to the therapy, however, a strong proliferative response of T cells to HBcAg and HBeAg was demonstrated. In conclusion, immune complex disease may complicate chronic hepatitis B in patients expressing HBe-minus HBV mutants. Treatment with interferon-alpha was found to be effective in mixed cryoglobulinemia even in the presence of HBe-minus HBV mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
492,0.001,1.0,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) has been reported in some cases of allogenic bone marrow transplantation, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and organ transplantation. However, to our knowledge, no reports have been made on the frequency and risk factors involved in HBV reactivation after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). Forty seven patients who underwent APBSCT were retrospectively analyzed. Three patients who were HBsAb positive before APBSCT contracted post-transplant HBV acute hepatitis. All 3 patients had multiple myeloma. HBV DNA could not be demonstrated in preserved samples of transfused blood. Therefore, we speculated that reactivation of latent HBV had occurred. The 3 patients with HBV hepatitis had relatively lower titers of pre-transplant HBsAb, and the total dose of steroids they received after APBSCT was significantly higher than for other patients who did not experience post-transplant HBV reactivation. There were no significant differences in pre-transplant hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) titer or total post-transplant blood transfusion volume. Our study suggested that immunocompromised states, especially those induced by high-dose steroid therapy, may allow the reactivation of HBV after APBSCT, even in patients who had HBsAb before APBSCT."
9371,0.001,1.0,"Human Immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) share common modes of transmission which include blood borne and the vertical routes. Although, the natural course of HIV does not appear altered by HBV, the rate of liver-related deaths is several times higher among HIV/HBV co-infected persons. Clinicians providing care for HIV positive individuals, including pregnant women, need to be aware of this problem. This is a 2-year cross-sectional study that commenced in January 2006, among HIV positive pregnant women seen at the University College Hospital, Ibadan. During the study period, 721 HIV positive pregnant women were screened for hepatitis B virus infection. Sixty-four women (8.9%) were positive for HBsAg, 14(1.9%) were HCV positive and 642 (89.2%) were negative for both HBV and HCV. One patient was positive forboth HBV and HCV. There were no remarkable differences between HIV infected and HIV-HBV coinfected patients in terms of the hematological, albumin and bilirubin measurements. Alanine transaminase was however higher in the HIV-HBV co-infected patients than HIV patients and this was statistically significant (17.5 iu/ ml vs. 15.0 iu/ml, p value--0.009). In addition, the CD4 cell count was lower and the viral load marginally higher in the hepatitis B virus positive patients. The differences were however not statistically significant (p value--0.114 and 0.644 respectively). HIV-HBV co-infection in HIV positive pregnant women is not of negligible proportions as demonstrated in this study. Thus, HIV positive pregnant women should be screened for HBV and assisted to access care targeted at preventing morbidity and vertical transmission."

3586,0.001,1.0,"Human immunodeficiency virus antigen (HIV-ag) was determined by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in HIV-antibody (anti-HIV) positive as well as pre-anti-HIV seroconversion sera and the results analysed according to stage of infection, risk group, age and geographic origin. Eleven (19%) of 58 homosexual men tested showed HIV-ag in a serum taken 3-4 months before or one at the time of anti-HIV seroconversion. In another eight (14%) HIV-ag persisted after seroconversion and half of them developed AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) in contrast to none of the other 50 anti-HIV seroconversions. Two (13%) of 16 haemophiliacs tested had HIV-ag only in the first anti-HIV seropositive sample. HIV-ag was present in 86% (30/35) of Dutch homosexual men with AIDS, in 32% (7/22) of men with ARC and in 17% (24/145) of men with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) or without symptoms. Three percent (2/60) of sera of asymptomatic i.v. drug users from Amsterdam were HIV-ag positive. Ten percent (1 of 10) of sera from Central Africans with 'Slim Disease' were HIV-ag positive. Among infected children from the USA or Europe 89-100% (8/9 and 2/2) of AIDS cases, 67-100% (6/9 and 3/3) of children with ARC and 75% (3/4) of asymptomatic children were HIV-ag positive. The HIV-ag EIA appears to be able to identify HIV infection earlier than the available anti-HIV assays in a significant number of cases. Since persistence of HIV-ag, except possibly in African cases, is strongly associated with clinical deterioration, HIV-ag appears to be a suitable marker for, independent of their clinical status, selecting individuals for antiviral therapy and also for monitoring the efficiency of such therapy."
2731,0.001,1.0,"It is still unclear whether hepatitis G virus (HGV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection influences the natural course of chronic HCV infection and the response to interferon (IFN) therapy. In this study, we investigated the HGV RNA changes and responses to IFN therapy of HGV RNA-positive hepatitis C patients. The presence of HGV RNA in 264 patients who received IFN therapy at our institute was examined using the nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers deduced from the 5' non-coding region (5'-NCR) of the HGV. We also analysed the nucleotide sequences of the 5'-NCR and HGV before and after IFN therapy. Twelve (4.5%) of the 264 patients with chronic hepatitis C were HGV RNA positive. Of these 12 patients, full information was available in nine. Of those nine, seven became HGV RNA negative during IFN therapy but in six of the seven a relapse occurred. HCV RNA was not detected 1 year after IFN therapy in six patients. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of all the HCV RNA-negative patients post-treatment was within the normal range, irrespective of their HGV RNA status. Nucleotide sequences did not change after IFN therapy in any patient. Hence, we confirm that HGV is sensitive to IFN therapy but the liver damage caused by HGV infection is very mild or does not modify the liver function tests."

In this study, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of B19 parvovirus DNA was carried out on the sera of 49 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-seropositive patients, negative for the detection of B19 DNA at dot blot hybridization assay and with different values of serum anti-B19 IgM (27 patients proved positive and 22 negative). Of the 49 HIV-seropositive samples tested by nested PCR, seven were positive for the detection of B19 DNA. All seven belonged to the group of subjects seropositive for specific anti-B19 IgM. The study shows that, in the presence of specific B19 IgM, circulating virus may still be present but can be detected only by PCR. In that B19 infection can occur with low-titer viremia in immunocompromised patients, PCR may be the only method for virus detection."
3013,0.001,1.0,"Natural or experimental feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection in cats is often associated with hematologic abnormalities which are similar to those observed in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. To determine if cells in bone marrow are infected with FIV and whether severity of hematopoietic disorder is correlated with the level of viral infection, bone marrow tissues from ten experimentally and two naturally FIV infected cats were examined by in situ hybridization for presence of FIV RNA. Seven of the 12 FIV infected cats were also naturally or experimentally coinfected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV). FIV RNA was detected mainly in megakaryocytes and unidentified mononuclear cells in the bone marrow of cats that were sick and had marrow hypercellularity and immaturity. These included all cats in the acute phase of FIV infection and two of seven long term FIV infected cats. One long term FIV infected cat with lymphosarcoma was also positive for FIV RNA in bone marrow cells. The other four long term FIV infected cats were relatively healthy, with normal bone marrow morphology, and were negative for FIV infected cells. Bone marrow from three non-infected and two cats infected with FeLV alone were also negative for FIV RNA by in situ hybridization. We concluded that megakaryocytes and mononuclear cells were targets of the viral infection and that the presence of FIV RNA in cells of the bone marrow correlated with marrow hypercellularity and immaturity, and severity of illness."
